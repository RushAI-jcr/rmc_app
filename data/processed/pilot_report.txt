--- Cost Estimate ---
Already scored:     99 applicants
Remaining to score: 1358 applicants
API calls (curated): 9,506 (7 per applicant)
Estimated cost:      $114-$171
Estimated time:      5.8 hours (15s per applicant)
  (vs full 21 dims:  28,518 calls, $342-$513, 17.3h)

--- RECOMMENDATION: GO ---
Criteria met: 2 of 4
  [FAIL] Incremental R2 = -0.200 <= 0.05
  [FAIL] Feature-selected MAE improvement = 0.39 <= 0.5 (k=5)
  [PASS] Significant dims = 3 >= 3
  [PASS] Feature-selected R2 = 0.074 > 0 (k=5)

Rubric features show incremental value with feature selection. Recommended: score curated 7 dims (Mission Alignment, Adversity & Resilience, Motivation Depth, Community Service Depth, Patient Care Depth, Leadership Depth, Adversity Response). Use: python -m pipeline.run_rubric_scoring_v2 --dims curated --resume

--- Caveats ---
1. Sample size (n=101): results have moderate confidence intervals
2. All rubric scores are from test set — no Plan B training possible
3. Stacking simulation is optimistic (assumes perfect rubric at test time)
