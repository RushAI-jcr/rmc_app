With a cup of coffee in one hand and my notebook in the other, I was always ready to absorb the discussions that clinicians and scientists held on the advancements of novel therapies for HIV/AIDS during our weekly institute-wide seminars. As clinicians debated the merits of treatments such as HAART and CAR-T, they drew from their experiences in treating patients and their concern for them. Working towards a career in medicine but new to translational research, I found myself reflecting on what it meant to bridge the gap between science and medicine and felt my aspirations for becoming a physician fully crystallize.
 
I was initially drawn to studying HIV because I had seen firsthand how destructive a virus could be. When I was a pre-teen, my dad fell acutely ill from his hepatitis B (HBV) infection, which was endemic to his native country of South Korea. I will always remember how my mom choked back her emotions to explain to me why Appa was in the hospital. Having met someone who had lost her dad to HBV just a year prior, I instinctively braced for the worst and felt my youthful light-heartedness dissipate as I trudged into a premature adulthood. It hurt to learn that if the HBV vaccine had been developed earlier, it might have prevented my dad’s infection. My dad’s doctors were eventually able to control the virus and prescribed a drug that had newly been approved for HBV. Unfortunately, the pill caused harsh side effects in my dad and it would be years until a more tolerable alternative became available. From watching my dad become a fraction of the person he had been before his illness, I learned how critical the prevention of an illness was and how existing treatments had their drawbacks and limits.
 
I entered UCLA determined to learn about the preventative care that could be so pivotal to a person’s life. First as a member, eventually as club president, I volunteered in a community outreach club and served at local health fairs throughout Los Angeles. I joined health professionals to care for patients, many of whom had limited access to medical attention beyond these fairs, and measured blood pressures, explained what to expect during a mammogram and comforted anxious patients as they had their blood drawn. While talking to patients, I often found myself using the same reassuring voice and approachable body language I saw in the physicians working alongside me. At one event, I met a woman and her daughter at the flu vaccine booth and we communicated through a mix of broken English and Spanish. As I explained why annual flu vaccines were beneficial for both her and the community, I noticed that despite nodding along, she was turning away. Recognizing parallels in our immigrant backgrounds and how multigenerational households are more common in these demographics, I asked if they happened to live with any grandparents to which they answered “yes”. Because the elderly are more susceptible to serious illness from the flu, it was safer if everyone in a household were immunized. Instantly, the vaccine that the woman seemed ambivalent towards became her imperative. A potentially lifesaving vaccine was readily available to this family, but if it were not for my cultural sensitivity and respectful persuasion, it might as well not have existed. I decided then that as a physician, one of my highest responsibilities would be to treat patients with an understanding of their backgrounds and unique circumstances.
 
At the fairs, I also met patients who had fallen through the imperfect safety net of preventive health and who, like my dad, were inflicted with the slow burn of an incurable or chronic condition. Even with treatment, some of these conditions could progressively worsen. At the time, I had come to accept this as an unfortunate fact. It was when, at the Institute, I met the physicians who tackled HIV/AIDS at both the bench and bedside that I saw how I would be able to help change this notion. As a physician, I would directly treat patients while simultaneously advancing treatments through research to broaden the possibilities of care for those left with few options. 
 
Today, I conduct translational research at UCLA where I discover and validate novel cancer treatments with the same passion as when I first felt the thrill of being at the frontiers of medicine. The cancer cells I examine under the microscope daily are my domain, and each incremental discovery I make builds a case for the capabilities of modern medicine. I am driven by the clarity with which I can envision myself comforting patients and their families as I combat their cancer cells with an arsenal of clinical knowledge. While my journey towards a medical education has been a long and nontraditional one, the additional courses I took and excelled at through UCLA Extension and the diverse clinical and research experiences I gained have enriched my perspective and equipped me with the skillsets that I will need in my chosen field. As I take the next step towards my medical career, memories of my own family’s experiences and the stories of the patients I’ve had the privilege of meeting over the years keep me committed to my path forward with unwavering conviction.","My previous trip to Tokyo had been a success, but I felt uneasy when I arrived to Kyushu- an island of Japan, and noticed that the street signs were solely in Japanese. Whereas Tokyo was accessible in various international languages including English, in Kyushu I was not able to make either heads or tails of the street signs in front of me. Supremely lost, I relied on the kindness of strangers and communicated through hand gestures and Google Translate to find and reach my destinations. During my humbling adventure, after which I decided to learn more about any region before traveling there, I learned to approach people in an entirely new environment with whom I did not share a common language. This taught me to let go of all assumptions and to remain mindful of how diverse our lived experiences and world views often could be. As a physician, I will treat my patients with utmost respect and treat them as unique individuals who will have been shaped by their different life experiences.","I grew up feeling fortunate to have lived in a community as multicultural and welcoming as that of Los Angeles (LA). Ready to give back while at UCLA, I co-founded the Mentoring and Health Education Program (MHEP). _x000D_
_x000D_
MHEP, a weekly program that connected UCLA mentors with kids K-12 from the LA area, focused on pairing students with mentors with whom they could relate to. We encouraged group discussions on topics such as practicing effective communication and gave students a healthy outlet to discuss the nuances of coming from different cultures and family dynamics. Additionally, we empowered our students to make healthy life choices such as by teaching them about the importance of eating fiber and starting each class with a group meditation. By utilizing my familiarity with the local community and providing members with the resources that I knew would benefit them, I positively impacted my LA community. _x000D_

2023,13767033,,29,Another Gender Identity,USA,1,EO2,0,1,"My Mexican mother and my Puerto Rican father were the only members of their respective families to move to the United States. As first-generation immigrants, my parents grew a family with barely any social or financial capital. My family relied upon food stamps to survive despite my parents working constantly. As a parentified child, I spent most of my time cooking, cleaning, and raising my siblings. When I was old enough to work, I had a job to help the family instead of focusing on school or social life. When my parents were home, there was often conflict resulting in verbal and physical abuse. My father was especially emotionally elusive and financially impulsive, contributing to our financial demise. When I left for college, my mom struggled to manage the household unaided, and I would return home on weekends to help, disregarding my needs. Introspecting my childhood, I can emphasize how it has shaped me into the resilient, caring, and creative problem solver I am. These experiences allowed me to develop expansive empathy. I comprehend how it feels to be mistreated, and I aspire for the opportunity to make my future patients feel protected and heard in their most vulnerable moments.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,8540,1080.0,45.0,70.0,4176.0,,1,115,1,4221,05/27/2022,Franklin & Marshall College,Neuroscience,0,,Yes,Yes,No,"$25,000 - 49,999",8,1,1,1,25.0,25.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11,Adequate,2,2023,3,5.0,0.5,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, my family observed Leo slowly stop yelling “GOLAZO!”. Subsequently, he started jumping and flapping when he was happy or excited. Leo’s developmental regression and repetitive behaviors at two years old were the first warning signs. Since the closest developmental pediatrician had a two-year waiting list, we searched for another who was two hours away but only had a 6-month waiting list. The longer the waitlist to see a developmental pediatrician – the more time Leo would go without preventative therapies. When Leo finally received his diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), I could see my father distancing himself as I witnessed how my mother solely carried the burden of having a child with additional needs. During the emotional whirlwind, my parents faced the tribulation of navigating the American healthcare system as Spanish speakers. I could sense my parents’ struggle due to their lack of social support and financial resources. I wanted to lift my parents’ burden while providing agency for my younger brother, who was eight years old and non-verbal. I was determined to find a way to help my younger brother, Leonardo, communicate. Over my two semesters of American Sign Language (ASL), I was able to teach Leo many simple signs such as “please,” “thank you,” “more,” “help,” and “I love you .” To our amazement, ASL bridged the gap in verbal communication. By the end of the year, Leo would not stop asking, “More Cheerios, please!”. This experience, coupled with years of learning how to care for Leo’s unique needs, drives my passion for pursuing a career as a developmental pediatrician. 

When pursuing a career in medicine, I seek to amplify access to healthcare for underserved, minority communities. My parents needed a professional who spoke Spanish, comprehended their culturally-informed perspectives on ASD, and could effectively communicate medical knowledge using a culturally humble approach. Nevertheless, their difficulties stem from systemic inequity that demands a global overhaul across the healthcare system. I contributed to this significant issue by practicing Medical English with Cuban doctors who recently immigrated to the United States. I spent two hours a week for a year building an English medical-specific vocabulary with them as they studied to pass the Step1 exam. Despite their credentials, it disheartened me that language was a high barrier for them to practice in this country where there are Spanish-speaking communities. Moving forward into medical school, I strive to use my Spanish speaking skills and Latinx identity to traverse language and cultural gaps between the medical system and minorities. 

As a queer, non-binary Latinx, I value understanding intersectionality and individuals through their multiple identities. Every Wednesday afternoon, I spent time with 12-year-old Areli – a young Latinx with a single working mother, a recent diagnosis of ASD, and a fierce mistrust towards doctors. Areli can speak English, but with me, she chose to talk in Spanish out of comfort. We worked through math homework, chatted about her crushes, and explored the Mutter Museum. On the brink of puberty, Areli often asked me questions about her changing body, menstruation, sex, gender, and even her attraction toward other girls. Areli showed me how language, cultural humility, and vulnerability could serve us when trying to bridge the most distrustful gaps. In building rapport with Areli, I developed a relationship that allowed me to offer her a new perspective on how seeking medical advice can be safe.

Finally, my passion for medicine comes from a desire to improve the accessibility of research for underserved minority populations. The barriers for minorities in research became more evident as I made my way through posters and presentations at the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) Annual Meeting in 2018 and 2019. During the conferences, I would my time perusing the demographics of others’ experiments, where I frequently found myself disappointed in the lack of diversity in research. However, as a Clinical Research Assistant at the Center for Autism Research (CAR), I have been able to make an impact on ASD research perceptions in the Latinx community. Telemundo 62 reached out to CAR looking for a Spanish speaker to present our research for their Enfoque segment. I was the only person at my workplace who spoke Spanish. Though apprehensive, I knew this would be an opportunity to make ASD and research a more approachable topic for the Latinx community. 

A career in medicine would allow me to help others, use critical problem-solving, and do what I do best—connect with those who are often misunderstood and neglected. The compassion I gained while raising Leo compelled me to seek experiences that have given me the confidence to become a physician. Mentoring Areli, tutoring Cuban doctors, and working at CAR have reinforced my commitment to becoming a bilingual developmental pediatrician. I intend to plunge headfirst into the medical field, lead by example, and show others how to deliver culturally sensitive care. Ultimately, I hope not just to become a doctor but an advocate and change-maker working towards a more equitable medical system.","As a queer Latinx, I am no stranger to how identities lead to stereotypes and discrimination. As an undergraduate student at F&M, I minored in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. I learned the roots of discrimination and oppression during those classes. Having an academic framework allows me to internalize no longer the racist, sexist, homophobic actions of others. I learned even more from commiserating with others that had similar experiences. My education and experiences compel me to advocate for those that do not have the platform to help themselves. I appreciate how Rush Medical shares the value of using its resources to provide widespread care to the niches of society. I am especially interested in the Rush Community Service Initiatives Program, which serves low-income and displaced populations, to the Correctional Health Initiative. I cannot wait to use my cultural humility to get involved in helping the diverse community on the West Side of Chicago. ","I want to harness my language abilities, empathy, and interpersonal skills to heal the wounds medical racism has left on people of color. While working at the Center for Autism Research, Telemundo 62  approached me with an opportunity to demonstrate our research for a segment called ""Enfoque: Trastornos del espectro autista."" This opportunity perfectly reflected the kind of work I wanted to do. I want to use my Spanish and cultural competency to bridge the gap between the medical field and underserved communities. I am interested in beginning my medical education in Chicago because knowing I can serve primarily people publicly insured, people of color, immigrants, and low-income makes me excited. I look forward to continuing to hone my language abilities at SOAR meetings, Medical Spanish elective, or volunteering at the Mexican Consulate Health Organization. I am especially keen on the study abroad options via the RISE program in Villa Verde, Dominican Republic. ",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, I was concerned for the health of my parents and my younger brother because they all have preexisting conditions. As a family, we had many conversations about planning what would happen if our parents passed away, mainly because my younger brother has high-needs autism and cannot live independently. In August 2020, I moved to California to get a fresh start and apply to post-baccalaureate programs. I recognize that the COVID 19 Pandemic was and continues to be detrimental to many people and communities. Furthermore, the hardships I faced during the pandemic do not compare to the heartbreak many endured. The pandemic further highlighted the inequities and gaps in medicine. These gaps compelled me to pursue medicine to use my Spanish and cultural competency to help bridge the divide.",1,0,1
2023,13769330,2021,29,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"I was born and raised in northern Chicago, an area experiencing a massive Latinx population boom at the time. Both of my parents were Mexican immigrants who moved to the U.S. in pursuit of a better life. My father never graduated high school and had to work overtime to keep us afloat. Spanish is my first language. I had to learn English with little to no help from my parents since they could not speak it. Thus, in grade school I became the main translator for my family. Navigating online resources was hard because I didn't have internet in my house until high school. It was hard to find Hispanic mentors who worked in medicine. To the point of people telling me “Mexicans don’t become doctors here”. I have worked full time while going to college full time. This and the anxiety about paying back a six digit value in student loans contributed to the downward trend in my grades my final two years. Every experience has been a lesson. By overcoming the challenges I faced, I learned that my failures are not indicative of who I am. I have developed the strength and tenacity needed to overcome problems with limited resources.

We were on Medicaid and there were a select few clinics who accepted this insurance. My mother could not afford a babysitter, so when one of us needed to go to the doctor all three children went to the doctor. My mother would hold onto my brother with one hand, hold me with the other, and carry the baby in a baby carrier strapped to her chest. My mother spoke very little English, so many things were lost in translation with the pediatricians. I tried to help with the English that I learned in primary school but there is only so much a child can do. The situation was complicated by my older brother’s autism diagnosis. We were already struggling with communication issues, and now there was a nonverbal child with a Spanish speaking mother in a mainly English speaking world just trying to get help for him. But one day my mother met a pediatrician who would unknowingly start me on my path to medicine, Dr. JoAnn Ruiz. She was the first pediatrician that I met who spoke Spanish. As I watched her treat my autistic brother, her soft and quiet interactions with him settled something within me. Dr. Ruiz did more than treat our physical ailments, she provided hope and guidance. Reflecting upon this as I grew older, I realized that I wanted to dedicate my life to pursuing a career as a physician. 
Throughout my college years I noticed there were very few Latinx mentors who worked in medicine. It made navigating pre-med difficult. My situation, that many other first generation Latinx youth experience, made me become self-reliant. That unfortunately made it hard for me to understand when it was time to ask for help, how to ask for help, and how to not feel undeserving of help. I felt as if I was falling behind. As I continued gathering clinical experience I was given the opportunity to shadow a physician. Dr. Jacqueline Olivo was the first Latina physician I ever worked with throughout all of my clinical and volunteering activities. She was not surprised. As Dr. Olivo began to mentor me, she stressed the need to understand oneself and why they wanted to be a doctor. Through reflection I realized that there was more than treating a patient in a clinic setting. A physician is also a mentor and advocate. I saw the need in the Latinx community for more Spanish speaking doctors who identify as Latinx. Anyone can learn Spanish, but that is completely different to understanding the struggles that Latinx people go through when it comes to their health. Dr. Olivo would also go on to introduce me to the most inspiring organization I have ever been part of: The Medical Organization for Latino Advancement.
During MOLA’s 2019 symposium I was overcome with emotion when I saw a room full of Latinx students and professionals. Dr. Pilar Ortega, the president of MOLA, spoke about how lack of representation affects both our health and aspirations. It makes us believe that there is no space for us in a field predominantly populated by people who don’t look like us, or sound like us. But we belong just as much as anyone else. When I had the opportunity to volunteer for them during the COVID pandemic, I saw their message in practice. We wrote letters to advocate towards allowing International Medical graduates to practice medicine during the COVID crisis, we had multiple events to promote masking and vaccination in the Latinx community, I organized virtual interviews with Latinx health professionals so they could discuss how the pandemic was affecting the Latinx community and how history and disparities was affecting that change.
I decided to go back to school to study Public Health, because I wanted to learn how our current health system operated. Everything from where you live, what food is available to you, safety, culture, and how much income you earn greatly affects your health. Through my studies I began to make connections to my experiences and how they have affected me in ways that were out of my control. I heard so many stories about the deterioration of physician/ patient relationships because some doctors just didn’t understand the culture or language of their patients, even when the doctor had good intentions. Or how peoples’ symptoms or concerns were brushed aside because of their race or gender. But I know there are doctors out there trying to make a difference. I saw it with my pediatrician and each of the doctors involved in MOLA. 
I appreciate every challenge that I faced because it allowed me to become the person that I am today. While my interest in medicine was birthed by witnessing how impactful a physician can be to a patient and their family, I was also motivated through understanding the disparities faced by Latinx patients. I want patients to see themselves reflected in their doctors. Through each experience my understanding of a physician’s role in society has evolved. A physician treats but also uses their platform to advocate for better healthcare and advocate for the betterment of disadvantaged communities. I believe my medical education would help me achieve that dream.","I grew up in a largely Hispanic neighborhood in Chicago. But when I was in middle school, my parents decided to move out to the south suburbs. I was shaken by the experience. The school had 2 other Latinos and neither were in my specific class. It was hard trying to connect with people who you had little in common with. But there was a girl there named Meriem, she was Arabic. We began to talk about our home lives, parents, siblings, foods and noticed we were quite different. But even though there were differences, we noticed similarities as well. Rice was an important staple in our dishes. Our parents pushed us to be academically successful, and that religion played an important part in our lives. It showed me that no matter how different someone is, they can have similar dreams and fears as me. Listening to them and putting myself in their shoes is both a novel and well-worn experience. Something so small as meeting a new friend can help you grow so much as a person.","I had the opportunity to intern for MOLA during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Around this time there was a lot of misinformation and fear regarding the virus. Latinx were some of the hardest hit by the pandemic and I wanted to do something about it. At first it was word of mouth and sharing resources on my social media accounts. Even though I was nervous, I decided to get vaccinated as soon as it was made available for healthcare workers in December of 2020. I believed this could provide confidence to friends, family and other Latinx who were nervous about the vaccine. I had many reach out to me to assure them that it was safe. As I shared my experience with other MOLA members we decided we needed to reach out to the community. I, along with committee members and co-chairs, decided to organize a virtual event that discussed COVID-19 misinformation and why vaccinating was important. More importantly we had segments spoken in Spanish, so we could reach as many as possible.",,,1,"I had been working on two research projects during the Fall of 2019 and Spring of 2020.

When the shut down happened we could no longer safely recruit patients and the project was put on hold. The COVID-19 virus halted a lot of in-person extracurricular activities that I was slated to participate in. Such as LUPHA's tabling event where we would provide information as to why it's so important to fill out the 2020 census. MOLA's annual symposium had to become a virtual event.

And as the fall season gave way to the cold of winter, I found myself in yet another empty grave. As I waited for the deceased’s body to reach me, I heard the chanting of a prayer from the crowd above, and the nearby idling of a bulldozer. The aluminum ladder, my method of entry and sole means of exit was removed, and a body was gently lowered from above on a plastic board. Steadying myself, I quietly worked to slide the body off the board. I then positioned Auntie Jameela’s head towards Mecca and used my hands to move dirt into the crevices around her body. My work done, I signaled above and the ladder was lowered. I took one last look around and climbed upwards. Sweating and covered in dirt, I inhaled a deep breath of fresh air. 

Three weeks prior, Auntie Jameela was alive and awaiting my visit to her nursing home. She was a member of my congregation whose cancer had, until recently, been in remission, but who was now terminal. As an Imam, or faith leader in the Muslim community, I considered my task simple: to visit her and provide reassurance. During the walk to her room, I felt confident: after all, how was this any different from leading prayers or teaching classes at the mosque? But as I entered her room, I sensed something was different. When I took my place in the chair at the foot of her bed, she motioned for me to move closer. When I did, she looked into my eyes and said, “I don’t want to die.” I felt my confidence evaporate. As I held her hand and caught sight of the prayer beads on her blanket, I could feel the fear in the room. I also realized that I would need a new approach. After a few moments of silence, I gathered the courage to speak and offered to recite a chapter from the Quran on healing. The tension in the room dissipated, and, over the next hour, Auntie Jameela shared fond memories of her grandchildren and her youth spent overseas. When the conversation inevitably reached a moment of regret or sorrow, I gave her space to feel her emotions and to grieve. As I lay in my bed that evening, I felt as though my visit had improved Auntie Jameela’s mood and given her some measure of peace. 

Inevitably, my time with Auntie Jameela and countless others- before and after their deaths- has caused me to reflect on my own life and mortality. My work as an Imam had made me adept at providing comfort and reassurance to individuals who were sick and dying. Yet I still felt a yearning to provide something tangible that would alleviate their suffering. In volunteering at Kaiser Permanente, I witnessed physicians treating patients with interventions that lead to something tangible: reduction in pain, and sometimes, even a cure. These experiences nurtured my desire to better understand the role of a physician. At Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), I not only met Dr. De Filippo, a urologist, but was also exposed to the significant emotional investment and time demands required of physicians. Time and again, I observed Dr. De Filippo reschedule personal obligations in order to attend to his patients. In particular, as I was getting ready to leave one evening, I got a text from Dr. De Filippo: a family had arrived upstairs without an appointment. Their toddler was having surgery the following week, and they were concerned about the operation. As I joined Dr. De Filippo, I was surprised to find that rather than tiredness or frustration, he appeared energized. His patience in answering questions and explaining the treatment plan to patients and their loved ones underscored to me that medicine was a calling. Even as I found my community work as an Imam fulfilling, I recognized that clinical work gave me the tangible results I was seeking as patients became healthier. This helped me to confirm that medicine was my passion.

Although I enjoyed studying Public Health, I found health policy lacked the personal interactions that I craved. I soon began creating such opportunities outside of my mosque as an Interfaith leader. In this role, I facilitated dialogue between Muslims and members of other faith communities. In one meeting in a local church, what was supposed to be friendly dialogue between a Christian and a Muslim became heated. As I worked to defuse the situation, I reminded them about shared values and beliefs: love of God’s creations; justice and tolerance; and the value of service to others. I shared how lessons I had learned from both the Bible and the Quran had taught me not to fear, but to help the homeless, the sick, and the disabled. Moreover, my faith guided my interactions at CHLA: through prayer, reflection, and consultation, I learned to understand and limit my own biases as I cared for patients.   

My interest in medicine stems from my desire to care for others. This began in my local mosque as well as in the churches and temples of my community. As I brought different groups together to build bridges and foster dialogue, and as I comforted the ill, I knew that I wanted to alleviate suffering and provide more than hope to those whom I was serving. My time in graves continually reminds me that while I cannot stop death, I can work on both the temporal and spiritual levels to improve the lives of my patients as a physician.","My social justice experiences have underscored to me the importance of humility and optimism when helping others. Initially as a college student, however, I was exposed to the opposite attitude: too often humility was seen as a weakness by colleagues, or as the opposite of confidence. In volunteering with the American Red Cross (ARC), however, I had a paradigm shift: as I toured sites around the Greater Long Beach area and engaged with diverse stakeholders- K-8 students; parents; community leaders; the elderly; and others- I realized that traditional (paternalistic) approaches would only exacerbate existing health inequities. Instead, I found that by becoming an inclusive, shared decision maker, I could effect greater positive change. In modeling this behavior, I discovered that clients began to engage with me more. They also requested additional materials and signed up for CPR classes. I look forward to sharing my insights and experience on creating inclusive teams with RMC.","In mid-2020, the outlook for a COVID-19 vaccine was uncertain. On a personal level, I worried for my own health and my elderly parents. During this time period, my mosque was deeply affected: as parishioners became ill and passed away, there was a great deal of emotional and spiritual loss within our community. In spite of this, I placed my fears aside and put my trust in God‚Äôs hands. I served my mosque by delivering groceries to elderly parishioners; comforting the ill and their families; and performing the last prayers, washings, and burials for the deceased. My goal with each individual was to give her/him a decent interment. And, furthermore, to support their families by providing a prayerful sendoff. As I worked to support my community, my listening and empathy skills grew. I also became increasingly resourceful and patient as funds and personnel stretched thin. My time comforting the families of the deceased taught me when to speak, and when to give others room to grieve. ",,,1,,0,1,3

Though I knew finances were a concern in our household, my parents were able to provide me with the necessities. It became apparent how fragile our finances were in the inability to afford extras. Interest in participating in any extracurricular was usually met with the concern of how to pay for it. During my junior year of high school, I started working to have spending money for myself. Though this took away from my studies, I was still able to gain a college acceptance.
When I started at San Diego State, money continued to be the main factor in my decision-making. I stayed with a relative for the first year of college instead of living in the dorms to save money. While I was able to save money by not staying in the dorms, I instead had a 45-minute commute each way to school, which took away time from studying. Also, while at San Diego State, I had to work to support myself. I worked 30 hours a week on average and lived on a tight budget. Working a shift the night before an exam was not unusual. The demands of providing for myself and being a full-time student often clashed with each other. Since returning to school in a better possession financially, I’ve been able to be a better student.",U,2,1,"In my freshman year, Spring 2006, I was placed on academic probation due to poor grades. I lacked the maturity to make the adjustments necessary to succeed in college. Though I was able to be removed from academic probation after Fall 2006, I found myself on academic probation again in Spring 2007. During Summer 2007, I took classes at San Diego CC; during that time, my grandpa became sick, and I spent time back home without completing my courses, putting me on academic probation. Days before the start of Fall 2007, my grandpa passed away after battling cancer. Attempting to cope with his loss and maintain satisfactory academic performance was too much for me, and I was academically dismissed from San Diego State after the Fall 2007 semester. I attempted to continue my education at the local community college in Spring 2008 but made no changes to my academic habits or attempts to heal from my grief. I was academically dismissed from San Diego CC. In reflection, I should have taken a leave of absence from academics to cope with my loss, but a leave would have likely just delayed the inevitable as I had failed to change my study habits.

The freezing mud chilled my bones as I crawled under the barbed wire towards the cries for help. When I finally reached the Marine, I found a mangled mess of flesh and bone where his left knee should be. As blood squirted from his leg, I slid a tourniquet over his left thigh as high as possible, then cinched the tourniquet until the bleeding stopped. Noticing no other severe injuries, I relentlessly dragged him towards cover. Upon reaching safety, I completed my assessment to treat any other injuries. Unfortunately, all I could do was provide covering fire and continue monitoring the casualty until the evacuation arrived. The instructor then slapped me on the helmet, letting me know I passed, reset the dummy for the following individual, and return to the starting point.
I had initially gone to college to pursue a career in engineering. To continue financing my college education, I decided to join the Navy in hopes of doing their nuclear engineering program. After being medically disqualified for being color blind, my focus changed to joining the Navy regardless of position. Now here I was, learning how to be a hospital corpsman. Not even a year later, I was about to explore a career I had not planned for.
At my first duty station, I was assigned to work in a Family Practice clinic. There I met “Paul,” a retired veteran, merchant marine, and diabetic. Paul’s jolly smile was the first thing I immediately noticed when we met. Looking over his lab results, I noticed his blood sugar levels were elevated. He dejectedly admitted that he was not the best at taking his medication or monitoring what he ate. As I asked Paul more about his lifestyle, he explained that he spent months at a time out to sea as a sailor and worked long hours. Meals were prepared for the whole crew; since most of the crew was Filipino, rice was present at every meal. Smiling, I told him I understood as rice and tortillas were also present for me during every meal while growing up. I recommended limiting the rice at each meal to reduce his carb intake and try walking around the ship for exercise. Paul returned a few months later for a follow-up, and his face was noticeably slimmer. When he stepped on the scale, I congratulated him on the weight he had lost. Chuckling, Paul proudly showed me the belt he was wearing. He proclaimed that he no longer needed to use the makeshift holes he made and could use the predrilled holes of the belt. Paul excitedly told me that he had more energy and could feel a change. Working with Paul to understand his lifestyle and how incremental changes that fit his habits could cause transformative changes had me start considering a career in medicine.
Front desk lunch coverage was usually a time to relax and catch up on any unfinished work from the morning, but today was different. I recognized “Lilly” at the window immediately, her usually bubbly personality was replaced by a pale stare, and I immediately knew something was wrong. As I spoke with Lilly, the counter supported more and more of her as her legs became unsteady underneath her. I rushed Lilly to an exam room and sought out Dr. Barr, our only Family Practice provider that would monitor her pregnant patients until it was time for them to give birth at the base hospital. As Dr. Barr searched for the fetal heartbeat, I could feel a collective sigh of relief as the familiar whooshing sound was heard. Satisfied with Lilly’s state, Dr. Barr asked me to start an IV and to stay with her until she felt better. As we sat and shared details about our lives, I learned that her husband was away conducting military drills and would not be back for a couple of weeks. Although she was used to being alone, this new chapter of being pregnant and alone scared her. Assuring Lilly that we would be here for her, I could sense relief when she would eventually share the name for her future daughter, “Ivory.” Although I found joy in providing comfort to Lilly, I felt the need to reassure her with the knowledge that only a physician could provide that she and her baby would be ok.
My experiences have shaped the kind of physician I envision myself to be. By working with my patients, I aim to understand their personal and social lives and help guide them to make health decisions that fit within their lifestyles. While teaching and educating my patients, I want to be an example for the next generation of healthcare professionals and contribute to their education. Lastly, working with underserved populations is not enough. I seek to increase the representation in medicine by mentoring students on their path to medical school. Mentoring students as early as high school to ensure that they are prepared for success in their undergraduate education and can become successful medical school applicants who become practicing physicians. Through my efforts, I hope to increase the diversity and inclusion of medicine.","I was fortunate to have grown up in a diverse city. When I joined the Navy, I was exposed to even more diverse groups of people. Growing up in California and being Mexican, I had always been surrounded by my culture. When I got stationed in Hawaii, where there‚Äôs a mixture of cultures present, the Native Hawaiians with large influences from Pacific-Island and Asian cultures mixed in, the security of having my identity always present was gone. I was fortunate enough to work with local individuals who were welcoming and exposed me to the various cultures present._x000D_
My experience of being in an unfamiliar cultural environment helped me experience what being an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù felt like. Being able to build a community where I felt comfortable and safe stemmed from the fact that other people were willing to teach me and expose me to their culture while also learning about mine. For me being inclusive means building a community where cultural experiences can be shared, and everyone feels valued.","While working in a local high school in support of Improve Your Tomorrow‚Äôs mission to increase the number of young men of color to attend and graduate from college, I saw how the lack of basic necessities could disrupt a student‚Äôs education. During one of my mentoring sessions with Joseph, I asked about his grade in biology and why he had some missing assignments. He confided in me that he couldn‚Äôt afford the poster board to complete the project and was also facing food insecurity. To assist him, I let him know IYT had a fund for such occasions and gave him a list of local food banks in the area. I wish I could say Joseph was the only student I worked with who faced such challenges, but many of the students faced struggles outside of the classroom. The barriers many students faced made it understandable why school was not always a priority in their lives. Yet, despite the adversity they faced, many just wanted an opportunity to succeed.",,,1,"During the 2020-2021 academic year, I planned to return to school to continue my path to medical school. I had taken two years off to be a stay-at-home parent and to support my spouse‚Äôs career. Due to classes being online, my family and I did not move from our mid-size city to the major metropolitan area where the school was located. I looked forward to the shadowing, extracurricular, and research activities that would be available. Unfortunately, like many students, the activities were canceled for the 20-21 academic year. _x000D_
Where my situation differs from my classmates was the unique challenge of being a father and having a wife who works in healthcare. The plan for when I returned to school was for our 2-year-old daughter to attend daycare while I was in school. However, finding reliable and safe daycare was difficult, especially since my wife works with a vulnerable population. Despite these challenges, I feel like I did well in the program.",1,1,3
2023,13983876,,34,Woman,MEX,0,,0,1,"I’m a first-generation, undocumented Latina from Mexico, raised by a single mother with a sixth-grade education. While in elementary and high school I did not have academic or financial support, though we would have likely qualified for SNAP, WIC, and Pell grants if not for my status.

Being one of a few students of color I was unable to find encouragement for higher education from staff at my high school. Ineligible for federal financial aid, I enrolled in community college then transferred to the University of Washington with scholarships. I was facing housing and food insecurities, without strong cultural capital. Once Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was enacted, I worked 40+ hours a week while enrolled full-time in upper division STEM courses. Consequently, I withdrew from courses I was not prepared to take.

I was in college when I met a Latinx physician; it was transformational seeing him lead a medical team as it was previously difficult to stay motivated without seeing representation. This invigorated me to ask for help, and self-advocate, and was subsequently able to pursue an accelerated MPH at Columbia. I prioritized school and strengthened my academic skills by active learning. With discipline, I thrived in my advanced science classes while studying for the MCAT and working.",U,0,1,"In the spring of 2014, I was placed on departmental academic probation. I was taking 2-5 science classes like biochemistry, microbiology, organic chemistry, and labs. I wanted to take the same classes as my peers, ignoring my lack of a solid academic foundation and socioeconomic hardships. 
 
I was hungry and couch surfing, while also taking time to go to my mother’s appointments 3 hours away by bus. I would often become emotionally overwhelmed with family, financial, and immigration worries and was unable to focus on class. We were severely in debt as my mother went through her cancer treatments and once I gained the right to legal employment in 2013, I became the head of household.  I feared DACA immigration policy would end, and I would be unable to continue to support my family. 
 
From 2014 until my graduation in 2017, I was not placed on departmental academic probation again. I found mentors, worked less so I could attend office hours, and joined study groups; I learned I enjoy teaching others. These experiences taught me to have good communication with family members to support my mother, good time management to balance school, work, and studying, as well as the humility to ask for help when necessary to move ahead.

I knew from my time as a cancer information specialist that clinical trials might be an option, but given my mother’s undocumented status, I was unsure if she would qualify. My mother's oncologist has always made her feel heard, safe, and well cared for; she trusted him with her life, and yet she hesitated to let him know. As a volunteer interpreter at free clinics and health fairs, I have observed the same uncertainty weigh heavily on undocumented families' decision to seek healthcare even when physicians have created a positive, trusting environment. Factors beyond the healthcare setting affect the care patients seek, and this continues to motivate me to become a physician confronting disparities. As a caregiver and undocumented individual, I have discovered a passion for medicine and a desire to advocate for underserved communities.
 
I volunteer as an interpreter at health fairs knowing that undocumented immigrants, like my family, often fear pursuing medical services that may lead to financial burden and deportation. While volunteering, I met a woman who was unsure which services she should prioritize. She confided that she had been waiting since the previous night, as buses did not run early enough for her to line up, and I understood the extraordinary lengths many patients go through to receive even limited care. She chose mental health counseling and shared it was a service she long had been thinking about, but her diabetes management had taken precedence due to limited time off work. I felt like an intruder in such a personal conversation, and the patient also wished for a provider who spoke Spanish so she would not have to divulge her feelings to a third party. I realized it was not enough for me to empty drains, care for surgical wounds, and interpret. I want to be the person capable of offering hope by gaining the knowledge, critical thinking ability, and skills to treat patients holistically to create a comfortable environment and improve outcomes. 
 
To understand systemic inequities in health I explored health disparities in research which exposed me to themes of medical mistrust. As a research coordinator for the Comparing Outcomes of Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) study, I observed how some participants of color were distrustful of the trial. I was once paged to randomize a Spanish-speaking patient, unsure about participating. I understood her hesitation given the historical trauma minoritized communities have suffered through research, and subsequent deep-rooted distrust in healthcare. I answered her and her family’s rapid-fire questions, tailoring my answers to meet their health literacy needs. In the end, she consented to randomization. She felt empowered to help future patients like her. It was incredible to work with the physicians who were taking care of patients in the clinic and taking care of the community through patient-reported outcomes research. Like them, I hope to build trust, educate, and humbly amplify the voices of vulnerable communities to implement equitable solutions in medicine.
 
The opportunities to work as a cancer information hotline operator and research coordinator, could not have happened without the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. I was granted a work permit in 2013, and I was finally able to legally work to significantly help my family and find stability for myself. As an undocumented transfer student at the University of Washington in 2012, a traditional pre-medical experience became even more challenging as I balanced schoolwork while navigating housing instability, food insecurity, and caring for my mother. I struggled with confiding in advisers and pursuing opportunities for fear that my status would be discovered. I learned how to operate within the higher-education system while using codes to safely ask about resources for undocumented students. My love for science mitigated my fears and galvanized me to forge my own path to explore and learn about medicine. Encouraged by my mother who only had a sixth-grade education, I became the first in my family to earn a Bachelor of Science degree and later a Master in Public Health degree.
 
My journey working within and advocating for diverse populations has solidified my intent to provide quality compassionate care for underserved communities as a physician. My collective experiences have provided me with empathy and resilience to establish the foundation for a career in medicine. I am undocumented and unafraid, and I understand my role as a bilingual, first-generation, Latina physician-activist in the making. I want future physicians to join me in understanding social justice as a medical issue and the importance of emphasizing social determinants of health in medicine to improve care. Using my platform as a physician to improve health equity is a responsibility and a privilege, but what calls me the most to medicine is the trusting partnerships with individual patients. I look forward to the day I lead a medical team to treat patients, respect their lived experiences, elucidate barriers to healthcare access, and advocate for health justice.","As a smoking cessation counselor for the National Cancer Institute Contact Center, I counseled clients who felt they had tried everything to quit. I do not have family or friends who smoke, so it was challenging to understand the anxiety and desperation they felt. However, my training in motivational interviewing skills, coupled with my empathetic nature, allowed me to forge a connection with my clients._x000D_
_x000D_
Many clients expressed their frustration with themselves. But they were facing incredible odds given the addictive nature of nicotine, coupled with poverty, unemployment, racism, discrimination, and domestic violence. I learned that successful health interventions should take these social factors that result in health disparities into consideration. This experience inspired me to improve health outcomes as a future physician by motivating patients, providing health information, and addressing non-medical needs with a team of social workers and patient navigators for all patients.","I recognized the crisis my own family was experiencing was similarly affecting thousands in Washington State - we were ineligible for the CARES act relief and unemployment benefits due to our immigration status. At the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network Hotline (WAISN),  I answered calls from community members facing eviction, workplace safety concerns, and food instability. One caller had lost his brother to the COVID-19 virus but was so worried about making rent payments that he did not even have time to grieve. _x000D_

Amid these calls, I noticed the Spanish-speaking community was receiving delayed information regarding masking, symptoms, and vaccines. I was able to start a conversation with WAISN leadership to prepare for COVID-19 vaccinations. We now have a regularly updated list of vaccination sites across Washington State and a Washington Department of Health-approved script to reassure callers that regardless of their immigration status, they can receive the vaccine at no cost._x000D_

They would often look to me for clarity as I tried to translate and relay their concerns to his physician. Over time, I saw my father transform from a man who avoided the doctor's to one who diligently watched his diet and stuck to treatment. Initially, I attributed his recovery to countless medicines and dialysis, but later realized it was possible through the connection between him and his physician. I saw firsthand how powerful a patient-physician relationship could be and was inspired by their compassion in working with my stubborn father to follow in their footsteps.

As the first in my family fortunate to attend college, it took time before I learned to balance home and school through my post-baccalaureate program. Mentors like Dr. Jey, who despite caring for patients day in and day out in the emergency department (ED), also devotes time creating a national mentorship program helping students like me achieve their goals in medicine. Through working with him, I expanded my definition of a physician as a healer and educator of patients in understanding their diseases, but also an advisor who harnesses their gratitude to give back. Motivated to offer some of the guidance I had wished for at that stage of my life and have been lucky to come across since, I organized a Pre-medical Youth Conference for high school students in disadvantaged areas aspiring to be clinicians. 

Appreciation of the resources available to me led me to volunteer with the Project Vietnam Foundation to provide basic medical services to the rural communities of the Hai Duong province in northern Vietnam. One bác (uncle) suffering from headaches was found to have significantly elevated blood pressure. We rushed him back to a physician who swiftly ordered medicine to lower his blood pressure and improve his headache. I learned a blood pressure reading was more than a mere set of numbers and timely intervention could mean the difference between health and more serious complications. Back at home, I had the privilege to educate uninsured Vietnamese patients at a student-run clinic on the basics of blood pressure control and risks of unmanaged hypertension. Aside from a shared common language, there was an element of trust that enabled me to introduce complete strangers to preventative health measures. Connecting with our community reinforces my goals to become a relatable physician who educates patients towards better understanding and control of their health. 

My ability to connect with patients was challenged when I met Debbie, an elderly resident reliant on 24-hour care at the nursing home due to speech and motor impairment. During one of our initial reading sessions, she became visibly shaken and tearful. I felt inadequate as I spent an eternity trying to figure out the issue. The tension gradually resolved from her face as we wheeled across the grounds at her direction until she finally revealed she was afraid of getting kicked out of the facility. I paused at a thought so incredible but kept in mind this was her reality as I cautiously reassured her she was in the right place. Over six years, Debbie grew comfortable confiding in me and I was able to pick up that a furrowed brow and distracted stare signaled pain or anxiety to come. I learned effective patient care can involve communication that transcends words. Although you might not be able to fully understand what patients feel, you can offer comfort in their time of need. My time with Debbie taught me the importance of patience and paying attention in building trust to be able to offer this comfort. 

Working as a medical scribe with physicians who take the time to understand the underlying reason a patient comes to the ED broadened my awareness of community health needs. Specifically, many patients do not have access to primary care services. While others remind me of my dad before his recovery and demonstrate poor compliance and understanding of their conditions. It became apparent many patients who rely on the ED experienced a gap in their healthcare that could have been bridged through continued medical care, a growing need I recognized and am committed to provide in the future as a physician. 

Being a scribe trainer reinforced the idea that everyone learns differently. One student better understands how to compose progress notes through worksheets while another by acting out scenarios. Seeing them both grow and grasp concepts as I tailor my teaching style has been rewarding and reflects how I intend to adapt to teach my patients in the future. 

My appreciation for medicine stems from the lasting impact it has had on my family and has grown over the years after seeing the effects of health education and primary care on others. In my mind, the core of quality patient care is achieved through trust and communication between patient and physician, and improved health outcomes start at the foundational level. I hope to one day be able to give back to our community as a primary care physician who connects patients to the comprehensive patient care they need.","Before I started scribing in the ER, I had limited contact with the unhoused community but grew increasingly aware of the stigmatization this marginalized group carried. Homeless patients frequently visit the ER for non-medical resources like shelter placement and are often dismissed as less deserving of medical attention, which I learned to be a dangerous bias after judging a patient based on their appearance and assuming they did not have a true medical emergency. I was humbled as I thought back to my childhood when my family relied on government assistance for shelter and peace of mind that others are not so fortunate to have. Stereotypes will continue to persist in society but medical establishments should remain a sanctuary for all patients, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background. As a future physician, I will be more mindful to prevent the overwhelming collective opinion from shadowing my own and diminish pre-existing biases while serving diverse communities.","I opened the door to find my neighbor Roosevelt standing grinning from ear to ear. ‚ÄúBoth my doctors said they were so proud of me and how long I‚Äôve come!‚Äù I have known Roosevelt for about five years during which he would often come seeking dietary advice and help reviewing lab results. As an African-American man with a strong family history of kidney disease, Roosevelt grew more conscious of his health with age. Given my father had dealt with renal failure, I shared with Roosevelt the dietary restrictions I knew of such as substituting his favored orange juice with options that contained less potassium and were easier on the kidneys. He was often surprised by the impact of small changes on his health but was always engaged and excited to try.

I recognized Chris from the addiction support group I ran the prior week at Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program (BHCHP). While we exchanged pleasantries, I noticed he had lost his left foot.

“My diabetes medication isn’t working. They are amputating the other one,” he said somberly. That night, one question kept repeating in my mind: could Chris’s situation have been prevented? Although I was familiar with socioeconomic determinants of health, this was the first time I made a personal connection with a homeless individual.

While I volunteered at BHCHP Chris and I established a friendship; I learned about his upbringing, his favorite sports teams, and his substance use disorder. I told him about my spinal disorder and growing up in a household with addiction. As I got to know Chris, I began to grasp how lack of access to adequate housing, transportation, and a litany of other worries compounded Chris’s health issues making it nearly impossible to manage his diabetes. Although I could not treat Chris medically, I wanted to help him in some way, but at first, I wasn’t sure how.

A common topic for us was footcare. Both Chris and I had lost significant sensation in our feet, Chris’s due to diabetic neuropathy and me due to a spinal condition. Having a disease that is poorly managed or incurable is overwhelming and difficult to accept, however, I found comfort in sharing my fears with Chris and learning how he coped with his amputation.

Chris and I also spoke about my older brother’s addiction: he has been in and out of treatment for opioid use since I was in high school. His slow decline into an angry, resentful, and often violent person was impossibly hard to watch and comprehend. Growing up in a household with constant arguing, the ever-present fear that he may overdose, and his complete lack of remorse for his actions caused our family intense emotional strain.

Meeting patients BHCHP like Chris with substance use disorders similar to my brother’s helped me understand the intersectionality of psychological, physiological, and societal components that contribute to illness. Listening to patients’ recovery journeys sparked agency and hope in me; learning how I could make a difference in the lives of patients further fueled my fire to continue to support others and helped me accept my brother’s illness. I realized that to accept someone with an illness as consuming as addiction is to relinquish any expectation of reciprocation of support or even mutual respect.

Whether it was because he was transferred to another hospital or back in a shelter, eventually Chris stopped coming to support groups. Saddened by Chris’s departure I realized with each patient I interacted there was a common denominator—lack of resources. Even if Chris had access to sufficient care, the lack of social support contributed to the progression of his diabetes. Although I was angered by the unfairness of the patients’ circumstances, I was more upset that I had lost contact with patients with whom I had close established connections.

I found myself coping by immersing myself in scientific inquiry: by understanding the mechanistic basis of disease I felt hopeful that someday I could prevent negative outcomes. In retrospect, it was a way I could hold onto the friendships I made with patients. By researching diabetic treatments and mechanisms and the impact of homelessness on health, I still felt connected to Chris. Furthermore, our past conversations about my own illness prompted me to read literature on how developmental genetic modification possibly contributed to my spinal disorder and how physicians could use this information to pursue treatment.

Throughout my time at BHCHP, I have come to understand how I could help the patients as a volunteer. Listening and adapting to patients’ needs, promoting acceptance, and directing patients to resources helped me connect with patients. Ultimately, I noticed this trust allowed me to have a greater impact as a volunteer. Further, I found hope in reading scientific and public health journals because I saw how research could elucidate possible solutions to issues I witnessed at BHCHP. The intersectionality of health, social issues, genetics, and addiction absorbed me because I was piecing together a life story.

The combination of scientific investigation with the opportunity to establish meaningful connections while giving back to my community draws me to medicine.  Although I have always been interested in biological mechanisms for disease, it has been the experiences with my brother and patients like Chris that solidified my pursuit of a career in medicine. Working with patients like Chris I realized my passion for medicine is rooted in my desire to deepen my understanding of the interplay between the physiological, social, and scientific contributions to medicine and how these aspects affect patient care. Furthermore, watching my brother struggle, I find that feeling understood and accepted are crucial to creating the safe space necessary for effective care and healing. My time at BHCHP, various research laboratories, and clinical work have affirmed my passion for medicine.","Volunteering at Boston healthcare for the Homeless, I interacted with patients of various ages, gender identities, races and ethnicities, and different backgrounds than myself. Through this experience, I connected with patients on a personal level and learned about their upbringings, how they became homeless and how they felt stigmatized for their situation.  From this exposure, I changed my perspective and understanding about how socioeconomic status, intergenerational capital and institutional barriers effect physical and mental health. I also learned that it is the personal connection and desire to improve a patient‚Äôs life that draws me to medicine. Volunteering with this patient population I realized that I genuinely enjoy establishing connections with people from different backgrounds from myself, understanding different perspectives and learning from other people‚Äôs experiences."," As a volunteer at Boston Healthcare for the Homeless (BHCHP), I worked with populations at risk for opioid usage and HIV. In my role I lead addiction support groups and organized events in which health providers presented on various educational topics. For example, I hosted a staff nurse who presented on HIV prevention measures explaining its their benefits and uses. Another project I worked on was planning and hosting events to raise awareness about the impact of and how to prevent stigmatization of homeless individuals. Lastly, I collaborated with physicians and social workers on a grant for funding for patients suffering from substance use disorder to transition to sober living facility after they left the hospital rather than back to a shelter or living on the street. Organizing and participating in these projects I tried to educate, support and advocate for patients at BHCHP.

2023,14052346,2021,32,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"I spent my early childhood growing up in East Los Angeles, an urban community plagued by poverty and gang violence. My parents immigrated to the US from Mexico and worked long hours in manufacturing factories to support our family. My parents feared for our safety in the community we lived in and made the difficult decision to move us to the rural city of Santa Maria while my father stayed behind in LA to work. Though the transition from an urban to a rural city alleviated our anxieties about constant threats to our safety, it also presented an unexpected set of challenges. I found that my rural, underfunded high school lacked the resources to adequately prepare students for the rigors of college. As a result, I paved my own way through high school, independently seeking out experiences to enrich my education. Moreover, healthcare was far more inaccessible in Santa Maria than in East LA, further exacerbating the health disparities I observed in my community.  In hindsight, these hardships made me stronger in the face of adversity and taught me the importance of resilience. As a physician, I hope to draw on my background to serve and connect with patients from communities like my own.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,14860,4080.0,460.0,100.0,,,1,560,1,460,09/02/2021,University of California-Berkeley,Environmental Sciences,0,,Yes,Yes,Yes,"$25,000 - 49,999",14,1,0,0,30.0,50.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17,Significant,3,2023,2,2.0,0.5,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,"When I remember my childhood in East Los Angeles, I can almost smell the pollutant-filled air that often exacerbated my asthma. I remember walking into Emergency Rooms feeling breathless and afraid, only to be met by kind physicians who treated me so I could breathe comfortably again. The hospital became a refuge for me, both from my asthma and from the violence in my neighborhood. While children often feared going to the doctor, I valued the moments I spent there, as they were a momentary escape from the outside world.

One night, when I was eight years old, we awoke to the noise of stray bullets shattering our living room windows. It was then that my mother relocated my four siblings and me to the rural city of Santa Maria, CA. We moved in with my uncle, who worked in the fields as a fruit picker. He always stressed the importance of education to us kids, often saying, “The fruit of my labor is providing the opportunity for you all to pursue something greater than working in the fields.” My family’s unwavering support drove me to focus on academics and become the first person in my family to attend college.

While completing my undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley, my uncle passed away after a battle with colon cancer. Like many Latino men in my community, he was apprehensive about attending doctor’s appointments due to the social stigma and language barrier. Because of this, he had never received a colonoscopy prior to the day he was diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer. As I interpreted for my uncle when his doctor broke this news, I remember my frustration with my community’s lack of health literacy, the scarcity of preventative public health measures tailored to them, and my own lack of knowledge about his disease. When I reflect on my uncle’s passing, I sometimes wonder if he would have been more likely to seek care if he had a Spanish-speaking physician. This frustration ignited my passion to pursue medicine and bring this knowledge back to my community. However, during this time, I also suffered from kidney stones, and the debilitating pain impeded my academic performance for many months. As a first-generation student, I failed to realize the breadth of resources available to me during this challenging time. In retrospect, I learned a valuable lesson in asking for help, prioritizing my health, and drawing on the support of my mentors.

Upon graduating, I sought to deepen my understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease by pursuing a master’s degree in Stem Cell Biology. Under Dr. Eric Huang at UCSF, I identified and characterized a unique architecture in the developing brain that underlies the expansion of neurons during development. I became fluent in the vocabulary of neuroblasts and germinal zones, but could not share my excitement for this work with my family. I found myself caught between two worlds: that of biomedical research and that of my community in Santa Maria. Often serving as a bridge between these worlds for my family during doctor’s appointments, I became interested in making science and medicine more accessible to patients from backgrounds like my own.

To this end, I became a Spanish medical interpreter for various free clinics and outreach programs in my community. I currently serve as the Clinic Director for the International Health Collective, a non-profit organization that provides basic healthcare in Tijuana, Mexico. We work with members in the community to provide holistic and culturally sensitive care. On one memorable afternoon in Tijuana, an elderly woman presented with acid reflux. She was hesitant when describing her symptoms and often responded in one-word answers. Noticing her reluctance to engage, I sought to calm her by making a personal connection. When I shared that my parents are also from Mexico, her affect completely changed. As we connected over shared experiences, she elaborated on her symptoms and confided in me that she was having painful discomfort while urinating. With this information, her physician could more appropriately diagnose and treat her resulting in relief of her symptoms. I saw how, when the patient was able to relate to her care team and speak her native language, she was able to advocate for herself. Through years of working with patients from diverse backgrounds, I have learned that each patient’s relationship with medicine is a product of the culture they were raised in and their personal experiences with healthcare workers. It is a privilege to gain a patient's trust, educate them about their health conditions, and empower them to advocate for their health.

I envision myself becoming a physician who provides accessible healthcare to underserved patients and improves health outcomes in these communities. Healthcare is a right that should not be dictated by socioeconomic status or the color of one’s skin. It is through my upbringing and experiences that I have garnered the resilience to pursue medicine, the empathy to be of service to vulnerable patients, and the motivation to treat each person with the humanity they deserve. Today, the hospital no longer serves as an escape from the outside world; instead, it is the place where I see myself making the most meaningful impact on my community.","Living in the Bay Area, I learned about social determinants of health and observed the impact of food deserts on health disparities. Inaccessibility to nutritious foods like fresh produce contributes to chronic health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. As a volunteer for Oakland Youth Aspire (OYA), I sought to reduce these barriers by distributing fresh produce to families living in food deserts. In these neighborhoods, I built community gardens and led classes for youth about diet and nutrition. These experiences taught me the importance of listening to communities to understand their individual needs. As a Latina, I valued the opportunity to learn about the barriers unique to other marginalized communities and how I might better serve as an ally. As a physician, I hope to serve as an advocate for these communities by working with groups like OYA to improve accessibility to health resources, increase health literacy and help families understand the importance of nutrition.","I am a Clinic Director for the International Health Collective, a non-profit that travels across the US-Mexico border each month to provide healthcare to a rural, impoverished community in Tijuana. We aim to build trust with community members by maintaining a consistent clinic schedule, treating all patients with respect, and ensuring care plans are feasible for patients. Moreover, I have pioneered a Spanish interpreter program to widen the scope of our clinic and increase accessibility to care. As a first-generation Mexican-American, I value the opportunity to provide accessible, culturally competent care to underserved communities like my own. I am excited to get involved with similar outreach programs at Rush, such as RU Caring, and draw on my experiences in this space to pioneer novel ways of increasing health literacy and access to healthcare in underserved communities.",,,1,"Though I was deeply emotionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, I had the privilege of maintaining stable housing, access to resources, and employment. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated health disparities in marginalized communities and called me to dedicate my time to Clinic by the Bay, a free clinic that serves a diverse patient population in San Francisco. As layoffs increased, I helped patients apply to CalFresh, a food security program, to address the increased food insecurity that patients faced. Further, recognizing the difficulty of scheduling vaccine appointments for people who lack access to a computer, I helped patients schedule their appointments and answered questions regarding the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine. By playing various roles to serve our patients during this challenging time, I gained insight into the societal factors that are deeply intertwined with patients‚Äô medical needs.",1,1,2

He told his wife they could not afford to take Mariam to the doctor again. Two hundred pesos, ten dollars, precluded Mario from having his daughter medically evaluated. I saw anguish and desperation in his frowned eyes. I felt sick and powerless. As we rode the rest of the way to my grade school in silence, I kept asking myself how a medical system could value wealth over life. Mariam recovered fully, but that experience planted a seed within me that grew my aspirations and decisions for the next two decades.

I immigrated with my brother to this country at the age of thirteen amidst a security crisis in Mexico in which my family and I had received over twenty-three death threats. A subconscious remainder of this crisis drove me to attempt cultural assimilation by decentering my heritage. This insidious yoke led me to believe in an ethnocentric narrative that valued homogeneity, uniformity, and repetition. Working with an advanced cancer patient, Perla, helped me to better embrace my heritage. 

Perla emigrated from Latin America to Boston to seek better medical care. Before her admission into Health Care for the Homeless, Perla was sent from doctor to doctor throughout the city. Initially, we continued the indications from her last physician: a clinical-trial treatment for her cancer, metformin for her diabetes, and risperidone for schizophrenia. We noticed a worsening tremor and a marked absence of schizophrenic symptoms throughout her time with us. I studied her chart intensely, curious about her high dose of antipsychotic medication for over a decade. I found the note about her original diagnosis: shortly after immigrating, Perla’s mom passed away. Perla confided in her physician that she could “feel” her mother’s presence, and the physician diagnosed her with schizophrenia. Over a decade of notes, I found no further information about her diagnosed condition. I brought this to her clinician’s attention. Her neurologist, alongside a psychiatrist, ran tests concluding Perla was misdiagnosed and her medication had induced parkinsonism.  

My heritage and my roots allow me to provide unique perspectives that could benefit patients. If an understanding of Latin American culture’s deep religiosity had informed Perla’s original diagnosis, her expression of grief would have been considered non-pathogenic. Cultural heterogeneity, diversity, and variation, I have learned, are vital to providing high-quality, patient-centered care. Working with Perla, I visualized the networks of vulnerability to which she belonged: networks which, in part, I understood. I feel morally compelled to use my heritage and the educational opportunities this country has given me to dedicate my life to the service of others.

As I’ve acquired knowledge, my ability to serve others has increased. From the start of university, I knew I wanted to be involved in a lab where I could contribute to creating such knowledge. Fortunately, I found a biophysics lab where I obtained unrivaled mentorship. I was first tasked with a simple job: keeping the cells alive. While doing so was interesting, I wanted to contribute in a way that advanced the research. For that, I would first have to acquire more knowledge. 

For a year, I spent my time between classes, in the evenings, and on weekends at the lab, where I carried out literature searches, integrating what I learned with lab experiments. One morning, my studies proved useful when, under the microscope, I discovered a problem with our model: it lacked epithelial cells, and instead, connective cells had taken over. It was homogenous rather than heterogeneous. I urged the team to halt ongoing experiments; this timely realization avoided the inevitable retraction of our publications. My supervisor proceeded to confidently invite me to co-author a publication, lead a group of undergraduate students, and co-lead my projects.

My journey at university, however, was not always smooth. I had a difficult transition during my first year, and I can vividly recall telling myself that I should consider an alternate field. I overcame but did not want other students to believe they should quit because of a difficult adjustment period, so I became a mentor for first-year students. Most face similar, complex adjustment processes: through conversations with students, I helped isolate the causes behind their lack of success. Time and time again, their grades improved along with their confidence to remain in premed, which to me underscores the importance of guidance in decision-making. 

My experience with my cousin Mariam inspired me to become a physician. My trajectory toward medicine, however, has been a process of self-reflection and constant exploration. It has allowed me to evaluate my values and identity, all while having the privilege of helping someone else. Perhaps that is the beauty and allure of medicine: in the process of helping others, in attempting to understand the essence of humanity, one better understands oneself and grows. Medicine allows physicians to be advocates, teachers, and healers, all of which I hope to be for my patients.","Immigration requires the abandoning of that which is familiar for the unknown. At age thirteen, I had to leave Mexico due to an increasingly volatile security situation. My grandfather was previously kidnapped, my family received death threats, and a stray bullet tragically killed my aunt. This was the nightmare most Mexicans lived under at that time. _x000D_

One day, while making rounds, I walked into a patient’s room and asked if she needed anything. She requested a newspaper and some water. I brought it to her and we began talking. We soon realized that we both have Caribbean roots. She passionately shared her story about growing up there and migrating to the United States as a single mother. She spoke of her painful, swollen legs, which caused her hospitalization. The mood changed once the doctor walked in and sat down; the patient squeezed my hand and insisted that I stay by her side. The doctor explained her medical diagnosis which was cancer. After discussing the next steps in her treatment, the doctor left the room. The patient and I sat in utter silence for several minutes. She then began to share her thoughts. I was awestruck as she encouraged me to follow my academic goals and pursue a career in medicine. Despite receiving a life changing diagnosis a short while ago, this patient found solace in sharing words of support. I had just met her, yet we formed a connection. I wanted to do everything I could to help her emotionally process her diagnosis. Encountering patients at their most vulnerable points in life solidified my desire to join the medical profession as a physician, I want to be an advocate for my patients as a compassionate and knowledgeable physician. 
My first exposure to healthcare was the responsibility I had caring for my older brother. He was born with severe autism and epilepsy and does not speak. However, over time, I became aware of his many non-verbal cues. I am able to recognize his physiological gestures, such as a tilt in his head position which indicates he is going to have a seizure and I make sure he is in a safe position to prevent any injuries. I recall an evening in our hot, humid one-bedroom apartment; I heard a loud thud from the kitchen. I found my brother on the floor and my mom turning him on his side to ensure his safety. He was having multiple seizures and there was a brief moment of recovery however, he continued to seize. This episode was a new symptom that we never experienced; the decision was made to take him to the hospital. As we drove to the hospital, I held him as he seized in the back seat.  His seizures continued as I wheeled him into the reception area. This was the first time I felt helpless because there was nothing more I could have done to help him. I assisted my mom, and three other nurses help control his movement to insert an intravenous line into his arm. There he was given the medication Ativan and he was soon sedated. I fell asleep to the beeping cardiac rhythms of a patient next to us. This medical emergency occurs yearly. Caring for my brother, accompanying him to doctors’ visits and being his healthcare advocate, provided the initial spark for me to consider a career in medicine. The firsthand experience in my brother's life triggered my desire to improve health and healing for others. I learned the true meaning of patience and compassion, and the profound effect that healthcare can have on improving a person’s quality of life. 
I was inspired to contribute to the medical community when I took my first biology course in the Fall of college in 2015. One way in which I accomplished this was through a nonclinical research experience. While working in that administrative setting, many patients at the outpatient office were anxious about their kidney function; sensing their concerns I would have cordial conversations with them to make them feel comfortable. I remembered the patient I saw in Mount Sinai Hospital and the impact of having someone to speak to during a time of need. During the conversations with these patients, it became evident that there were other areas to explore that could put the patient more at ease. In conversation with Dr. Jia Ng, we embarked upon such a project. Since then, I have a firmer grasp on the intricacies of the research, the project is still ongoing. I hope to take this newfound love for research with me into my medical career, where I can cultivate my passion for evidence-based medicine, to benefit my patients, as well as the medical community at large.
My qualities of compassion, perseverance, and diligence will inform my journey into becoming a caring and culturally competent physician. I am very thankful for helpful mentors, teachers, and, most of all, for my older brother. He is a special gift to my family, and we care for him. Helping him is my guiding motivation and inspiration for wanting to make a difference in the lives of others.","Many inquiries were revealed during an open discussion about the office transition to electronic forms. My coworkers were apprehensive regarding electronic documents as they expressed concerns about possible repercussions. A secretary mentioned a HIPPA security risk because the tablets could be lost if not diligently monitored. I felt that tablets were secure by reducing the likelihood of misinformation from paper legibility issues. Despite having different perspectives, we collaborated to advance our main objective, patients' well-being. We coordinated a hybrid solution to give patients a choice of using paper or electronic forms. Through this experience, I learned to listen to the diverse perspectives of others and cultivate new approaches to conflict. As a future physician, I anticipate moments when I disagree with my colleagues; however, it is vital to remain open and value different perspectives to develop professionally and improve the healthcare I will provide to my patients.","I had the privilege of working as a mentor at Van Guard High School through the Liberty Partnership Program.

Coming from a low-income background, I understood her agitation and the relevant social issues. I empathized with her discomfort and remained truthful. Despite the many obstacles that may arise, her goal of getting a higher education is a marathon, not a sprint. I encouraged her to remain resilient and spoke to her about college. It was inspiring to hear her enthusiasm about her future career aspirations to explore the engineering field.

As a volunteer in the pediatric unit, I had become accustomed to patients being delighted to have my company. So, when Annie threw a lunch tray at my face while screaming “GET OUT!” I found myself at a loss. Her glare conveyed such a striking mixture of anger and pain that I sought to understand her. Several weeks of board games and puzzles later, she confided to me that she had received her repeat PET scan results. I could not imagine the daily difficulties she faced as she reflected on the strain her systemic illness put on her and her family. It was heartbreaking to hear her contemplate if her condition caused her parent’s divorce or the peers in school who made fun of her disfigurations. Knowing the struggles she faced and sensing my role as a confidante in her life, I dedicated part of my shifts to visit her.
I truly felt fortunate to be able to comfort her with my presence and privileged to be privy to her vulnerabilities, but an internal frustration arose as I came to realize my limitations. I could not even understand a simple Web MD summary of her disease, much less make a tangible impact on her medical conditions. This realization sparked my interest for a career in medicine and I knew this was a path I needed to explore more deeply. 
To better understand the role of a physician in a healthcare team, I worked as a medical scribe in several inpatient and outpatient settings. I particularly enjoyed the North Point Wellness Center - a holistic medical, dental, and mental health center tailored to serve minority and often uninsured patients. The sensitivity and ingenuity the family physicians demonstrated while building learning environments with patients of various backgrounds resonated with me deeply. The physicians would address various levels of medical knowledge using easily understandable terms and explain various practical solutions based on the patient’s preferences and available resources.
 One shift, a physician’s assistant asked the physician I was working with to help develop a health care plan for a medically complex, primarily Korean-speaking patient. Unfortunately, the patient did not regularly see a healthcare provider, resulting in poorly managed chronic diseases. Upon entering the patient’s room, I could tell she was uncomfortable as she was squirming in her chair and gazing at the floor. There was no interpreter immediately available as it was a hectic day in the clinic. Hoping to put her at ease, I cheerfully chimed the proper greeting for elders in Korean and offered to interpret informally until one did arrive.
Despite a language barrier and the pressure of a full clinical schedule, the physician remained relaxed and sat down at eye level with the patient. While holding their hand, she expressed her worries about the patient’s current trajectory. She then declared,” But I like patients like you. Because there is so much chance for improvement.” She balanced explaining the harsh realities of the patient’s diseases while remaining optimistic and inspiring, presenting several lifestyle and medical interventions to improve outcomes.
Throughout that year, I saw that patient several more times. She appeared progressively more vibrant and healthy, which was supported by the clinical findings. She attributed these changes to that first encounter where she finally understood the problems she faced. Because of this physician’s deliberate communication, the patient realized the importance of following up on her chronic diseases, and her trajectory improved. Observing and interpreting for both parties made me realize building rapport with patients was deeper than simply understanding what is said. This rewarding experience piqued my desire to become a physician who empowers his patients with the knowledge to change the course of their health. Furthermore, I learned the importance of educating patients in an accessible manner, tailored to their unique needs, communication styles, and preferences.
During my gap years, I have been working as an anesthesia technician in the OR. There, I have continued fueling my curiosity towards the science of medicine. What factors determine what type of anesthesia the patient will receive? What muscle/nerve tissues are currently visualized on the ultrasound? My questions were perpetual, and it was rewarding to apply my knowledge. Sometimes the anesthesiologists would answer my questions and other times I would read the available medical textbooks. I could use this knowledge to reassure patients when they had misunderstandings about a procedure within my scope. Over time, I was able to piece together patient factors and predict which surgical cases would require my services. There was always something new to learn if I sought it out.
As a physician, I hope to continue learning and use the knowledge to empower my patients. Having been on the periphery of the physician-patient relationship for years, I look forward to the day where I develop connections with my own patients. The trust bestowed upon me by patients during my medical experiences and the use of medical knowledge to improve patient’s lives serve as an impetus for why I am pursuing the profession.","In my junior year, a friend confided to me about her living situation with her partner. It was jarring to hear her recount the abuse, and even more heartbreaking that she thought no one would believe her. The next several months helped me begin to understand how hostile and biased the world can be against women._x000D_
Her attempts to break the lease were met with ‚Äúwe need more proof than just anecdotes,‚Äù which made finding a new apartment difficult: especially with limited finances. I was sure that pressing charges was the next step, so I contacted legal offices. When she found out, she became very upset. I learned that women who experience domestic abuse more often keep it to themselves for fear of public backlash, and taking this to court would likely involve a lengthy legal battle that would bear no fruit._x000D_
I now know that there is much to learn about the world that others live in, because it is not the same as mine. I am ready to keep an open mind so that I may do that._x000D_
","As a part of our research, my team and I created community cooking classes for the Hmong community in Minneapolis. The goal was to empower recent immigrants to continue cooking their traditional dishes with affordable ingredients they had access to in Minnesota. We hoped to counteract the impact adopting a western diet had on the microbiome and metabolic diseases. But as the number of people expanded, so did our scope. I proposed coordinating with a diabetes educator to make our recipes diabetically conscious. Participants shared their own recipes and favorite ethnic grocery stores. Seeing the general excitement and approval from students, especially the elderly members was very rewarding. Members organized carpools and bought food items in bulk to distribute amongst the class so that those without transportation were able to get groceries. Most of all, I felt fulfilled seeing our efforts helping enable this community access to nutritious food.",,,1,"‚ÄúCode blue. COVID rooms.‚Äù I rushed down the hall with the crash cart. In a cramped room, the team frantically bustled around the patient. Several hours later, despite our best efforts, a time of death was called. I looked at the MD in charge.

But this wasn‚Äôt the time for that- my work phone was ringing again._x000D_
In contrast, the pandemic‚Äôs effects on my personal life might seem trivial. My dad was forced to move to Korea for work. No confidante to share my daily joys or struggles with. Home has become just as silent and eerie as the hospital rooms I worked in. This made me more mindful of the patient experience. Considering how difficult isolation is while healthy, I can only imagine how difficult it is while ill._x000D_

I felt as frayed as the tarp above me as I began to speak. Here, behind the backdoor of a plywood-tented clinic, I asked her to share the place, time, and brief description of her last experience with sexual or gender-based violence. I explained that I only needed to know the last time; not the first time and not every time. I told her that she only needs to share with me what she is comfortable with. That this would put her on a list for the women-only section of the camp and connect her to other resources. I made it clear that I am not a doctor. My role was to listen and collect information. I could not provide the help she needed. She stood suddenly and vomited over the fence, her straw hat falling off her head onto her back. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, sat down, and started speaking. I listened and wrote: forced prostitution, Turkey, three days ago. How do you fit this into a two-line box? 
 
Each time, I made sure to sit facing the women, and that I do not sit between them and the way out. I made sure to bring a bottle of water. If asked, I would hold their hand. I made sure to meet their eyes. I filled out the boxes. I made no false promises. I let them know what I can do and what I cannot. I’ve done these interviews in six languages; the one word everyone knows: “Doctor.” I found myself wanting to respond to the call of  “Doctor, doctor”. Instead, I had to shake my head and tell people there were no doctors that day. 

At fifteen years old my only association with doctors was the one standing between me and my life plan: a college cross-country skiing scholarship and the Olympics. I had trained year-round since I was nine, driven to pursue that dream. An injury taught me the fragility of my body and how entirely my health determined my path. I spent frustrating years in and out of arm braces, supporting my teammates who achieved our Olympic dreams. Five years later, a doctor who understood the impact of my injury promised the level of function I needed. I struggled to balance the demands of rigorous college courses and the work to heal both my mind and body. With the aid of a team of dedicated health professionals and six appointments a week, I healed. My experience with injury as a teenager fortunate to have access to healthcare was in contrast to what I saw working in refugee camps.

When I lost skiing I lost my team, part of my identity. I found a new team when I volunteered with humanitarian aid organizations in the Moria Refugee Camp in Greece. This team was focused on and dedicated to being in service to others. The complex social, legal, and health issues presented in the field of humanitarian aid are fascinating. I was overwhelmed by the amount of need and the lack of resources. I saw doctors from around the globe spend their vacation working in a clinic stocked with not much more than Tylenol. “Doctors are needed,” as my friend put it simply, “because we need to be alive to make a new life.” They made patients feel seen, heard and cared for despite limited resources. When I asked refugees the one thing they wished the world understood, “that we all wish to go home” was the resounding response. For millions of refugees, home is a place they can never return to, that I alone cannot give them. However, I could return to my home, Alaska, and support the Alaska Native people in their fight to stay in their ancestral lands. 

I have the privilege to come from a home so well cared for by its people, that it is mistakenly called wilderness. I work in the Alaska Tribal Health System, which serves to keep Alaska Native people healthy and in their homes. I found unexpected parallels between the Greek refugee camp and rural Alaska in the complex legal, social, and cultural issues facing these populations: poor sanitation, overcrowded homes, and limited access to healthcare. Today I work alongside physicians who spend their time learning about the people they serve and seeking to enhance their cultural competency with the aim of providing the diverse care that Alaska Native people deserve. What struck me about the Alaska Native people was the fierce determination to stay in their homes and the incredible sense of community. I want to be a doctor who strives to understand the historical and cultural backgrounds of my patients, meeting people where they are with what they need as individuals and as a whole. 

The woman with the straw hat came back the next day saying that since talking to me yesterday she cannot close her eyes for fear of reliving her experience. “Please, I want the doctor,” but I could not be the doctor she needed that day. While I could not fully help in that situation and cannot give someone a home, I can help support a person to stay healthy, enabling them to keep or build their life. I strive to understand the larger social, cultural, and legal systems that impact individuals' lives and their health. I desire to be the doctor I needed when I was injured, the doctor needed across the globe, and the doctor my home needs working for its people.","One experience which helped me realize how colonization and systemic issues such as racism and intergenerational trauma impact an individual‚Äôs life was the Alaska Blanket Exercise (ABE), a participatory exercise on historical trauma that fosters respect and reconciliation. Participants hear descriptions of historical events, including genocide and cultural oppression, as land is figuratively stolen from under our feet and devastation brought by colonizers through war, disease, and substances. _x000D_
_x000D_
In the talking circle that follows, indigenous and non-indigenous share our experiences and visceral reactions, learning, and healing. This training and others like it have made me realize the importance of increasing my own knowledge and cultural humility and has provided a framework to look at data sets and see beyond the ‚Äúsocial determinants'' to roots in the colonist practices which formed them. Three years later, I support the ABE, helping the program reach those around the state.","I worked in Moria refugee camp with asylee seekers of various backgrounds, including places where it is illegal to be gay. Instead of having to hide being queer, I realized it served to connect me with those I was working with. While there were many differences between us, I found parts which I identified which I realized one of my first days working as coordinator of a women's health clinic while completing a triage form for a Congolese woman. I got to the question asking what type of birth control she used. Without missing a beat, she grinned and replied, ‚Äúwomen,‚Äù and I, understanding what she meant, grinned as well. Hoping in that small moment, I could convey that she was understood, seen, and accepted for who she was. _x000D_
_x000D_
On the surface, this is an experience in which I was working with those unlike myself. However, I found that I could utilize my lived experience as a queer woman to find commonality which allowed me to connect with and serve this population._x000D_
",,,1,"I moved to Alaska just before the pandemic to support my Aunt with a stage IV cancer diagnosis, limited to supporting from six feet away.

I was able to find employment as a Research Assistant; however, many projects were halted during the pandemic, which continues to affect distributing and publishing.

2023,14314476,,23,Man,USA,1,EO1,0,1,"Coming from a rural town, finding a career outside of the coal mines was unheard of, and the idea of pursuing a professional degree was almost sacrilegious. In my hometown, poverty was no stranger and affordable housing was often unavailable, making my family move 3 times in just as many years. My father took a job as a truck driver, working 14-hour days and hauling cargo across the United States. My mother picked up shifts at our local gas station at night, after my sister and I had gone to bed, to provide another source of income. Despite their hard work, my family could not afford basic amenities like electricity, qualifying us for government assistance like CAP and food stamps. The school district that we could afford to stay in was under funded and did not supply opportunities to explore my growing passion of medicine. My circumstances did not discourage me from following my passions. Instead, I found other opportunities that would allow me to provide care and nurture a career in medicine. When life got tough, I continued to maintain a positive outlook and remained resilient in the face of adversity. I have learned to use my experiences to empathize and aid those who are facing similar struggles.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,5070,500.0,900.0,750.0,1010.0,110.0,1,1650,1,2020,06/30/2022,Duquesne University,Biology; Environmental Studies,0,,Yes,Yes,Yes,"$25,000 - 49,999",4,1,0,0,30.0,20.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Exceptional,4,2023,2,3.0,0.5,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"“Uncle, I love you”. These words came as a surprise to me, especially since I was only 16 and not even an uncle yet. This phrase sounded even more shocking coming from my 55-year-old camper, who I was currently bathing after having spilled a bowl of chili on himself at dinner time. Coming into Camp PARC, I realized what I was signing up for, but I had no idea what to expect. I was excited to take a volunteer counselor position for three adult campers who had intellectual and developmental disabilities. I had been looking forward to this week and was excited to make friends with people in my community who are often overlooked. As the week progressed, I realized that providing emotional support when they missed their parents or giving hugs after singing their favorite songs were the reasons why many of the campers came back each year. They didn’t come back for the finger painting or bingo; they came back to see their friends whom they didn’t converse with outside of the camp session. Through my time at camp, I recognized the importance of relationships and how they will impact me as a future physician. As I pursue a career in medicine, this experience has made me recognize the uniqueness in each of my future patients, as well as the importance of developing a trusting relationship, like I was able to do with my campers. From my experiences volunteering and being a traveling personal care aid in my rural community, I have come to learn that taking care of people involves more than just understanding each person’s diagnosis; it is about listening, empathizing, and encouraging them to freely share information, concerns, and actively engage in their own care. Throughout my time as an aide, I found that people need compassionate and sensitive caretakers who are willing to listen to their patients’ difficulties that may not always be solved by a prescription. I hope to be a physician who appreciates the differences between each patient and can form a trusting patient-provider connection for everyone with whom I provide my care.
	My time throughout my rural hometown has made me recognize that a disparity in healthcare is present in my community. I have learned that there is a dire need for education on the need for good hygiene, the importance of food availability, and the promotion of self-care throughout my town. Although there are services that can benefit the people I took care of, many patients that I cared for did not understand how to complete the forms or even how to communicate that they needed help. Being from a rural, underserved community, disparities are often prevalent in people who are isolated geographically and economically. I, like most of the patients I took care of, live over 45 minutes from the nearest hospital, making a medical appointment unfeasible and a financial burden that many cannot afford. Through my research at my university, I learned that health disparities are present across the world. In a remote village in Tanzania, citizens face dangerous levels of fluoride in their drinking water, causing health burdens, like fluorosis. I am researching a cost-effective and functional way to remove fluoride using clay that is found in the village, potentially alleviating the symptoms of fluorosis for the benefit of the community. Through these experiences, I have recognized the impact of water quality on health and have developed a passion for family medicine and providing healthcare to rural, underserved populations like my hometown, as well as the village of Olkakola, Tanzania.
My decision to pursue family medicine was further solidified when I shadowed Dr. Lowden, a local family practice physician, on a “normal day in the office”. I saw the wide range of cases he attended to, as well as the lasting relationships he had formed with his patients. When witnessing his caseload, I saw that medicine is not always linear. In fact, many patients had comorbidities, like diabetes and high blood pressure. I learned that treatments were often interconnected and knowledge from many areas of medicine are required to create the best plan of care for each patient. As a work-study student at a hospital in Pittsburgh, I have helped physicians improve their work by identifying current literature that is relevant to their patients’ diagnoses. Exploring medicine through my time with Dr. Lowden piqued my interest in family medicine as he was often the first physician patients would see when they were developing symptoms of a new affliction. His willingness to listen to patients and create a comprehensive evaluation to understand the patient’s ailments confirmed that family medicine is my passion. Through my time with Dr. Lowden, I realized that the relationship between provider and patient is different and unique than what I have experienced. I witnessed patients being totally vulnerable to their provider, baring secretes they would never divulge to anyone else, experiencing a relationship that I have never seen before. I hope to one day implement the same techniques that Dr. Lowden used, like active listening and reassuring the patient, to create a welcoming environment for anyone in my care. I want to help and care for people in the unique way only a provider can, using education, research, and experience."," Recently, I was granted the opportunity to perform research in Belize where I performed water quality testing in remote villages that only spoke Mayan and relied on the native flora for their medicines. Being there for a month, I was able to immerse myself in the cultural and medical practices that were commonplace in the country, witnessing various roots being made into tea for upset stomachs. In my previous travels to other countries, I was able to develop an understanding of diverse customs, but my experience in Belize allowed me to witness the influence of medicine on a diverse population. My time exploring the village shaped the way how I will approach medicine, developing my cultural competence in providing care for diverse groups. My research experience shaped the way how I will perform medicine by recognizing the value that each patient may have on their culture‚Äôs natural remedies for ailments and how I, as a physician, can help bridge the gap with modern treatments.","In my community I started an after-school program for elementary students whose parents were facing struggles like addiction and suicide. As a high school student, I volunteered at my local elementary school and was informed of the devastating situations that many kids were facing in my community. So, I, with the help of my advisor, created an afterschool program where we provided a meal, help with homework, and companionship to younger students. I recruited 15 high school students to help provide this mentorship to elementary students who would deeply benefit from interactions with someone in the high school. By ensuring young students could receive this positive attention, I believe that I have helped my community by creating a safe haven for children who are experiencing unfathomable hardships. This opportunity created a lasting impression on my future and has inspired me to pursue primary care in a community where I may be able to provide this same service. ",,,1,"The pandemic and the impact it made on my family‚Äôs health has greatly influenced the way in which I want to perform medicine. While my sister‚Äôs health was rapidly declining, I saw the lack of readily accessible healthcare in my rural community. The lack of representation in medicine in rural areas had always been an important issue for me, but by experiencing the physician shortage and how it impacted my family, I became focused on the importance of primary care, and specifically, family medicine. Seeing the value that physicians placed in their patients and performing care for members in their community during the pandemic was monumental. I was inspired by the overarching dedication to service by healthcare workers and I realized that being able to contribute to medicine by providing care to rural communities will allow me to ensure that in the event of another healthcare crisis, I can be on the forefront and aid people in need, like my sister.",1,1,3

Some falls leave you with only dust on your back to show for it, others have you icing that back for a few days, but either way, you’re back on that horse as soon as you can be. I was fortunate that I avoided any major tumbles for my first six years with horses, but once I began to compete at the collegiate level, I gained a new appreciation for my helmet. My healthcare journey followed a similar trajectory. 

A physician father and physical therapist mother made early exposure inevitable; it took me until fifth grade to realize that placing IV’s wasn’t a “dad skill” like mowing the lawn or manning the grill. My mother still has the picture of thirteen-year-old me with my cow heart: gloves tied on at the wrists, braces bared in a rare grin. That delight was just as intense for me at twenty-one, while watching procedures on living human hearts—and all UTHSCSA wanted from me in return was a few pages of writing. After that summer, I was flying as high as I’d ever been, and wanted nothing more than to get the second half of my undergraduate education over with so I could get back to the “real world” of medicine.

Congratulating yourself for a jump is a great way to miss the next one—shortly after San Antonio, I fell. It had been a decade in the making, and there were plenty of warnings: I had the constitution of a Victorian orphan all through grade school and high school, with eleven broken bones to my name by age seventeen. Every specialist offered a different guess, from lupus to celiac disease. By the time I went away to college, my issues had resolved seemingly of their own accord, but we were never able to nail down why the sound of pencils gave me migraines or why I hadn’t ever hit my growth spurt despite every hormone panel coming back normal. 

So of course, I got sick. Weeks became months, and lethargy became borderline narcolepsy. If I wasn’t at work or in class, I was sleeping. I forgot to eat. I dropped a pen once, leaned down to retrieve it, and woke up the next day. A wiser student might have put school on hold, or at least asked for help. I blame stubbornness as much as the feverishness for that particular oversight: I couldn’t stop. I had to finish my last two years, hurry up and get my degree. Plenty of students were exhausted in college—I was fine. 

I reached the end of my denial phase halfway through senior year, and pushed through my final semester so I could hurry up and rest. I set my career aspirations aside and fell into the familiar routine of blood tests and sleep studies and consults, and thanks to several doctors and two very dedicated parents, I began to improve. This was true in more ways than one. I’d always hated talking to people, so when I was healthy enough to work, I made that my full-time job. Door-to-door salesmen are paid on commission, so my paycheck was directly tied to my performance. 

I found a job in the equestrian world, next, training horses to teach and riders to jump, and spent my extra hours at an assisted living home nearby, exploring a very different side of patient care. I still remember the look on one woman’s face after a flippant, “Da svidanya” at the end of a day; Maria was thrilled to converse in her mother tongue, despite the clumsiness of her partner. Tending to her and the others in her hall was excellent practice for helping my maternal grandparents when their health worsened in 2019. 

When COVID forced the world into a gap year, I was restless for more than one reason, and had plenty of time to think about why. I had graduated three years ago, and had no plan now beyond, “work”. Medicine loomed, rather than beckoned; I couldn’t possibly be a doctor, after stepping away for so long. But I still felt an itch, a craving for the pace and the rigor and the puzzles. My work as a STEM and test-prep tutor during lockdown both rekindled that spark and bolstered my confidence: I was twenty-five, not fifty. So shortly after I went back to my equestrian job, I made arrangements to leave it. 

Midway through my first month as an anesthesia tech, I was struck by a sense of having found my place. I have had days where everything went right, and days with two crashes in a row. I have learned to take pride in the small things, like neat cables or five-second art lines, and grown adept at fixing problems before they arise. That last is a recurring theme for me, in each of my very different workplaces, and likely the result of co-parenting several of my siblings. I am a restless tech, lost without a machine to fix or a case to start. 

But monitoring techs don’t fix people; we just measure them. And I want more. Even after sacrificing vacations, losing patients hours after laughing at their jokes, and working twenty-four hours, straight, I want to be a physician. I want to troubleshoot people, not touchscreens. I want it the same way I have always wanted to point my horse at a line of jumps. Never mind the blisters and bruises and broken toes; I get to fly.","If I had to pick one experience, the most profound for me was my nine months of door-to-door sales. My job took me all over the greater Troy area (in MI), and the neighborhoods ranged from quite affluent to the projects. But whether the house had a gate I had to unlock or a front porch that was falling apart, what lay on the other side of the door was a person. I was surprised by how relatable many of my customers were; I could have a conversation with any one of those folks, about their kids or their favorite team or the schoolwork they were struggling to complete online. I once had a twenty-minute conversation with a Venezuelan man about Spanish League Football (‚Äúsoccer‚Äù). The bottom line was, everyone had something they loved to talk about, something that made them open up. It‚Äôs just a matter of finding it.","I have a soft spot for the elderly thanks to my closeness with my maternal grandparents, which I owe in large part to the months I spent caring for them while working full-time. They were getting into their late seventies and lived just over half an hour away from the rest of us, which was becoming less feasible as time went on. My aunts and uncles all wanted them to move closer, as my grandmother‚Äôs health was deteriorating at an alarming rate (anxiety, paranoia, insomnia). My grandpa was overwhelmed, so myself, one of my uncles, and my sister rotated on a caretaking schedule from February to June. We cooked dinner, helped with meds and bedtime routines, and woke up early to fix breakfast and get them ready for their day before starting our own. After a hospitalization and a few family meetings, we finally moved them to a fixer-upper that we all pitched in to fix (I did the wallpaper and a lot of the painting), where they were able to live two peaceful years close to their grandkids.",,,1,"COVID nudged  me back toward medicine by a) providing me ample time for self-reflection as to what I wanted for myself and b) providing a vastly expanded market for my little tutoring business (it wasn‚Äôt so little in the year 2020)!

For one of these pre-lab reports, my lab partner was confused on what needed to be done so I decided to explain the instructions to him and give him a summary of what was expected. Although we worked on it individually, we ended up having almost similar calculations and as a result, we were accused of working on the report together.

I was about the age of eight when one evening, my brothers noticed I was sweating a lot and I felt warmer than usual. My parents rushed me to the nearest hospital where they were told I would need blood work done. Although my dad tried distracting me from seeing my blood being drawn, I remember looking over, seeing my blood and screaming. In that moment, a man, whom I later knew as Dr. Mukete, walked in and joined my parents in trying to calm me down. I don’t remember exactly what he said but as he spoke, I noticed he had a French accent and he was very accommodating.

The language barrier caused other economic and social divides to form in all areas of life, especially in healthcare. As a result, back then, rarely did physicians transfer from the higher paying, French-speaking areas of the country to the English-speaking cities. It was also very unlikely for a French-speaking physician to be friendly with an English-speaking patient or family. However, throughout my stay at the hospital, Dr. Mukete made efforts to comfort, relate, and inform my family and I of my progress and status. He would speak with us and make us laugh when he came to my bedside to check up on me. This effort made me feel like I could trust him. One afternoon after he finished speaking with my dad, I worked up the courage to ask him if he was from the French part of the country. I eventually came to find out he was French but had completed his college and medical school education in the English part of Cameroon. In an effort to bridge the divide within the nation, he decided to move to Bamenda for work.

At the time, Dr. Mukete’s drive and venture didn’t mean much to me and I often wondered how hard it must have been for him to learn English and leave his family behind. However, years later as an immigrant in the United States, my family and I relied on community events organized by people trying to bridge the gap. These events allowed us to network when we were seeking employment, obtain free health screenings when we didn’t have health insurance and get to know people in the community. These events opened up many opportunities for my family and I. Inspired by them, I started volunteering with organizations like the Minority Association for Prehealth Students (MAPS) while attending VCU, Christ Chapel Outreach and Convoy of Hope to provide food, clothing and basic medical exams for people in homeless shelters and low-income neighborhoods. Volunteering with these organizations caused me to realize that availability of resources such as good schools, grocery stores, good healthcare centers, libraries etc. are somewhat based on the economic standard of that community. This was the kind of divide Dr. Mukete was trying to bridge in Cameroon’s healthcare and his commitment showed me that no matter how small one’s effort is, it can have a significant impact at not just the individual level but that of a whole community. As a result, I decided to become a vessel of hope, awareness and representation as needed in medicine.

Throughout my journey, I have had several highs and lows. My weaknesses to work on and strengths to build on were made evident but through it all, my passion for medicine was solidified. So, while building better study habits in the G-squared advanced biomedical science program, I also learned how to better prioritize and manage my time. These skills helped me become a better student and a more confident test taker, which served me well when I took the MCAT. Additionally, becoming a part of the healthcare team as a medical technologist and medical assistant was very beneficial to me; working both in the lab performing tests and, on the floor, triaging patients, taking vitals, histories and assisting the physicians in minor procedures. I am able to witness the different processes physicians use to diagnose and treat patients. I also see the impact a physician can have on a patient based on their approach to the patient’s complaints and symptoms and how they advocate for them. Having a better understanding of the limitations in healthcare in addition to the overall knowledge I have acquired so far have helped me mature into a better and stronger individual. Although there is still a lot for me to learn, my experiences have allowed me to know what to expect and have prepared me to take on any challenges in medical school and beyond.

Nineteen years ago, Dr. Mukete showed me that being a physician goes beyond just seeing patients, making diagnosis and treating symptoms. It is being able to be a representation and a resource to people including underrepresented minorities. Additionally, it is about educating people with facts about health care and the benefits of taking care of one’s health for the betterment of the community as a whole. Being a physician is providing the best possible care to both the patient who can afford it and those who can’t. Finally, being a physician, I know long term would put me in a position to help take care of my family financially. I don’t know where Dr. Mukete is today but I am grateful to have been seen by him that night I fell sick.","I currently work as a clinical medical assistant at George Mason University (GMU) Student Health Services. GMU has a very diverse student population including international students. As a clinical medical assistant, I have to be able to interact with these students in a way that not only makes feel helped and cared for but also be respectful of their different cultures and background. I have come to understand that just because something may be normal for me doesn't always mean others are comfortable with it and I believe when providing treatment to patients, that needs to be taken into consideration. In addition, we see many of these international students at the clinic and language barrier can sometimes be an issue. This helped me become more patient and understanding since they might not always get the full idea of what is going on during the visit. As a result, I make sure the student's questions are answered to the best of my ability and that their complaints are addressed.","I believe that societal and structural determinants of health are just as vital as the physiological aspect. Good healthcare policies gives way for better treatment and healthier patients. Furthermore, healthy patients make healthy communities. It was this understanding that fueled my passion for health equity and as a result, I joined the Anti-Racism and Inclusive Excellence (ARIE) Health Equity Committee at GMU. In this committee, we develop ways to help everyone know their implicit biases towards people from different ethnicities, had some diversity training geared more towards learning to treat all patients with the same care and concern, surveyed students seen in the clinic to make sure they were properly taken care of and looked into other ways in which we could better serve the student population. It has been noticed that patients feel safe coming to be seen at the clinic because they feel heard, are respected and their specific complaints are addressed.",,,1,"As a full time medical technologist at Reston Hospital Center, I was required to only work 40 hours a week with no overtime. Every hour I worked as overtime had to be approved by the laboratory manager. However, all of this changed in the spring of 2020. Like most hospitals, we had limited resources with increased demand for care. As a result, we worked over 40 hours a week and tested twice or triple what we would normally test during a regular flu season. My coworkers and I quickly became each other‚Äôs support system as we spent a lot more time together. Moreover, staying with a parent who was considered high-risk, I had to quarantine at hotels several times due to exposures at work. Working under such conditions allowed me to not only see but also experience some of the undesirable parts of medicine. This provided me with more insight and understanding about the career I am trying to get into and helped me be better prepared for it.",1,1,1

My mother singly raised my 3 siblings and I, pursuing nursing to help take care of us. When situated, she worked many hours, leaving me the eldest child as a “back-up parent”.

The instability, and some medical emergencies that paused my mother’s ability to work, resulted in instances of homelessness, and use of safety net programs such as food stamps and unemployment assistance. I was on free/reduced lunch throughout grade school, and often missed or repeated units previously taught due to moving in the middle of a school year. Starting college at 15, I came of working age and used these funds to augment my aid to pay for groceries, sending extra money home. In light of my limited time, I enjoyed palliative care research as it was both an academic challenge and method of meeting financial needs.

My upbringing highlighted the importance of independence, being self-directed and resilient. I am grateful for these tools as they allow me to tackle the difficulty of becoming a physician and push through adversity.

Family dysfunction and my mother’s job as a traveling nurse fed into the constant relocation. In one move, I fell asleep in our packed minivan leaving the desert bordertown of El Paso and woke up in the urban city of Newark. Through it all, I had to learn unfamiliar cityscapes, adjust to new schools, master vernaculars, and develop often fleeting friendships. With this ordeal of instability came the gifts of adaptability and empathy. Faced with the frequent change, I learned to navigate various cultures and connect with diverse people. Always the new kid, I sought to understand and include others, making sure they felt the openness that I received. I came to value relationships, short-lived though they could be, and the cultivation of relationships forms the foundation of my goal to be a physician.

In college, I was my mother’s caretaker post-hysterectomy. This was scheduled after yet another hospitalization for a transfusion due to fibroids. In the surgical waiting room as her companion, I thought back to my first time accompanying her. I was 7 years old and had gotten out of school early. What I thought was an errand-run turned into a visit for a mammogram where I learned that my grandmother had passed from breast cancer. Though explaining as best as she could, my mother did not quell my many questions. Confused by what had happened with her family, I asked why she had to go into the scary machine, while frantically trying to grasp the breast diagrams posted in the room. Then as a young adult sitting alone in the waiting room, I was reminded of that feeling of helplessness, with the matured understanding that her healing would be complicated by stress and financial strain. Duty and obligation became tenets of my upbringing as I watched my mother sacrifice her health to support our family.

Nothing attracts college students like free food, and as no exception, I found myself at a Pre-medical Organization for Minority Students (POMS) meeting, looking for pizza and information. This turned into a significant stop along my journey as three years later, after serving in a variety of roles to fulfill our mission of empowering minority pre-health students, I was elected president. One goal as president included linking with local high schools to extend our pipeline to medicine, utilizing the access to underrepresented minority students afforded by my urban campus. When ""Aaron"" approached me at an event, peppering me with college application process questions, I never expected the impact my informal mentorship would have. Months later, with his college acceptance in hand, Aaron contacted me, thanking me for my help in navigating the process. With POMS, I was able to help reduce barriers to education, with representation being a vital first step in diversifying the face of medicine.

While kindling my interest in medicine, I found that working in palliative care research taxed my capacity to care for those living with life-limiting illnesses because I was frequently left feeling helpless. One student with cystic fibrosis had a packed schedule requiring airway clearance treatments, reminders to eat, and clinic visits–all on top of going to class. Here I came as an assistant, adding on that we regularly complete questionnaires. Despite how sobering our conversations could be, I looked forward to interacting with these patients and wanted more. With a stop in the real world, I transitioned into oncology as a coordinator. Fully integrated into the clinic, I was humbled with the access to patients’ lived experiences. One day I met “Martha”, a gardener who developed metastatic breast cancer. Under the bright lights of the small clinic room I listened to her story. She had been in remission for several years, and recent back pain led to the discovery of a recurrence. Martha’s goals were to see her daughter give birth in a few months and to play with her son’s toddlers. She valued treatment, with maintaining quality of life as a predominating goal. In our next conversation 6 months later, she expressed her accomplishments, crediting her physician and care team. Although my interactions with metastatic populations seldom ended happily, they signaled that I aspired to play a more direct role in care administration, to educate and learn with patients, maybe adding hope.

My interactions with patients have helped me to appreciate the trust they place in physicians, allowing access to their intimate moments. Through exposure, I have developed, now cherished soft skills, particularly in establishing relationships. How physicians act upon their training and knowledge, as well as the medical field’s need for adaptability bolster my view of medicine and treatment as a holistic pursuit. I desire to help those of underrepresented backgrounds enter medicine, as I do not want to be one of few but one of many. My mother's healthcare interactions helped me to learn about access to care and utilization. I also came to recognize the impact of support and advocacy. Medicine for me lies at the crux of my passions and those qualities have propelled me along my journey toward medicine, leveraging my passions in pursuit of service.","After college, I remained in town for another year working with my research team. In that year, I became increasingly involved in the community. The topic of one community meeting I attended was that another high-occupancy housing was to be torn down - a reliable option for those needing to affordably live close to downtown. The community was vocally worried, as there was now a pattern. With the different tech companies adding headquarters to the city, and the expansions of existing entities - long time residents were being priced out. They discussed strategies, race, gentrification, both the historical context and recent widespread examples like Washington, D.C. I had been in Pittsburgh for years and it was the first time I truly engaged in this manner. As an out of state student, one can isolate the city as the setting for my school, but there is life and blood running throughout. I was able to think about my diversity, actively listen and empathize with those who were different.","I was a volunteer tutor with For Love of Children (FLOC) working with under-resourced students. I saw many values were critical to my interactions with the students. One student did not want to be there, and that showed in his attitude. Though they warmed up in their own ways, I imagine that consistency and attentiveness helped. It was not my place to force a child to learn, but to be present for them to help facilitate their progress. Towards the end of the year with my regular student, as news of the pandemic was rising, she recalled that I worked in a hospital (I was a research coordinator), and asked questions about how people got sick and how the virus worked. Of course, I did not want to speak out of turn without express permission or what I was trained to do, but it was heartwarming that she felt comfortable enough to ask and trusted me with her questions. I was honored to be able to offer a calming voice of hope, though there was a great deal of uncertainty at the time.",,,1,"While I was still a coordinator, our primary disruptions included partial furloughs, a hybrid work environment as we had patients receiving critical cancer treatment, and helping our medical oncology clinic screen patients for COVID-19. In one breast tumor board meeting, the medical oncology, radiation oncology and breast surgery teams received guidelines to cancel or postpone non-essential procedures, such as lumpectomies and mastectomies. They met to see which patients could be medically managed indefinitely. The physicians submitted a great deal of exemption requests because they knew their patients could only reasonably tolerate a moderate delay. The advocacy was admirable to observe, and allowed me to mature my outlook of medicine to broaden the extent of teamwork, and responsibility required. In addition, For Love of Children was interrupted, as they did not yet have the support to move everyone online. When programming resumed, I was in Cleveland beginning my master‚Äôs program.",1,0,2

For most of my childhood, it was just my mother and me. I accompanied her to all her monthly doctor visits and ensured she took her medications. Despite following the doctors’ recommendations, she was frequently hospitalized for various medical and surgical emergencies. This took a significant toll on her mental health. The fear of bad news sometimes stopped her from seeking vital care, a concept I could not understand at the time. I felt helpless.

In 2017, after over a decade of severe ulcerative colitis, my mother’s doctor found over two dozen precancerous lesions in her colon. He recommended a preventive total colectomy. Due to her end-stage liver disease, she needed a new liver, but a potential diagnosis of colon cancer eliminated any possibility of receiving a transplant. Overwhelmed with the prospect of another major surgery, my mother immediately refused the colectomy and shut down further discussions. When we returned home, I wanted to understand her decision. She wanted to live as long as possible but feared uncontrollable bowel movements, potential leaks, and modifications in her life associated with an ostomy bag. I realized she needed people who could help her work through her concerns. I connected her with support groups, ostomy nurses, and mental health providers to address these concerns. She began to believe she could still live a healthy and happy life. She ultimately agreed to surgery and received the support needed to adapt to her life with an ostomy.

My journey with my mother planted the first seed for a career in medicine. I want to help others with similar circumstances align their treatment with their goals and values. During my experiences as a medical scribe in the emergency department and an internal medicine clinic, I enjoyed the critical thinking required to balance scientific concepts while addressing patients’ needs. While working with a primary care physician, I was inspired by how physicians develop therapeutic alliances with patients through their personal connections and longitudinally following their health. Like them, I also wanted to support patients and their families during their most vulnerable times.

During my time as an anesthesia technician, I observed a difficult decision made during a family conference for a critically ill patient in the intensive care unit. The physician presented the family with options for either a complicated heart valve replacement or comfort-focused care and explained the slim odds of surviving surgery. They had to decide on her behalf as she lacked decision-making capacity. I had a similar experience with my mother toward the end of her life when she, too, was presented with two options: comfort-focused care or surgery to place biliary drains. The chance of successfully placing drains was less than 1%, and the risk of infection was extremely high. It was a painful decision, but we ultimately pursued hospice since the procedure would not improve her prognosis and furthermore, did not align with her goals of care.

With tears streaming down their eyes, the family made the tough decision to pursue the complicated surgery despite the low odds. My knee-jerk reaction was thinking how this was not the right decision. However, as I watched the physician navigate the difficult conversation, tease out cultural intricacies, and ultimately respect the family’s decision, I realized this most aligned with the patient’s beliefs. In this moment, I recognized how vital a physician’s role is in understanding patients’ wishes in all care, especially when involving complex decisions. This inspired me to continue growing and expanding my cultural awareness to be the best advocate for my patients. I know there will be times when I may disagree with patients’ decisions, but my role will be to help them make their own decisions, not decide for them.

I wish to communicate openly with patients and understand their needs so I can empower them to make medical decisions that align with their health beliefs and values. Since becoming a crisis text line counselor, I have learned that the best communication lies in active, empathetic listening. To effectively de-escalate someone’s crisis or collaboratively problem-solve, I must first understand their perspective.

I previously thought the best physicians were those with the most scientific knowledge and advanced technical skills. While those qualities are still important, my personal family and work experiences have shown me that these qualities must be combined with deep compassion and empathy for patients’ emotional and physical needs. Watching the healthcare professionals I admire connect with and guide their patients through difficult times has solidified my passion and drive to become a physician who is knowledgeable yet humble, empathetic, and aware. I will carry these lessons and perspectives with me as I work towards becoming a physician who emphasizes patient-centered care with shared decision-making to best advocate for my patients’ needs.","I traveled to Panama on a medical mission to provide free healthcare to their indigenous population. It was a life-changing experience that helped me expand my cultural humility. I struggled to communicate with the locals when I did not have access to interpreters. However, over time, I became more comfortable with non-verbal communication and realized I could still have meaningful interactions despite the language and cultural barrier. I learned that delivering competent care and effectively communicating with patients from different backgrounds requires an understanding achieved through experience. Because of my experiences with people from various backgrounds, I will prioritize effective communication across all communities and strive to provide culturally competent care to my patients as a physician.","During the 2009 recession, my mother lost her job and health insurance. She could not afford treatments for her ulcerative colitis. Years of flare-ups ravaged her colon and led to a total colectomy, which could have been prevented with adequate healthcare access.

	From a young age, I knew I would pursue a career in a STEM field. I asked for a microscope for my sixth birthday, solved math problems at the dinner table for fun, and saved my chemistry homework for the end of the night as a “reward.” I realized my interests might lend themselves well to medicine during my freshman year of high school, when I dissected a fetal pig in my biology class. What had once been a chore of a class turned into an exciting exploration of the animal’s body: I marveled at the yielding of the tissue under the scalpel’s gentle pressure, the expansive network of red and blue blood vessels, the precise organization of the interconnected organs. I eventually realized there was a way to “do something like this” professionally. I decided to become a doctor.
	I spent my adolescence preparing for a career in medicine, completing all my college’s pre-medical courses and shadowing physicians. My first major clinical experience—volunteering as a medical scribe at a rural clinic—highlighted the profound impact that physicians can have on their patients’ lives. I watched first-hand as the providers’ care plans, gradually but unquestionably, helped their patients recover from severe chronic illnesses. My time at the clinic reinforced my desire to enter the medical field and led me to scribe in an emergency department after graduating from college. Jumping from primary care to the world of emergency medicine was certainly an adjustment, as every shift brought something different: minor concerns like bone fractures, life-threatening diagnoses like strokes, “sneaky” conditions like heart attacks masquerading as acid reflux. Rather than shying away from the fast-paced, unpredictable environment, I reveled in the new challenge and truly thrived. I was sure I wanted to go to medical school.

	What shifted my “want” to a “need” was my brother.
	My parents first described my brother as being born with “a broken heart;” at the ripe age of two and a half, I couldn’t say “transposition of the great vessels,” let alone understand what it meant. I knew he had surgery a few days after his birth, saw a cardiologist regularly, and had scans every few years—but he was an otherwise healthy kid. His last cardiac MRI was set for the spring of 2019, and we assumed this would be the end of his specialized medical care. However, the MRI yielded an unexpected finding: a large mass behind his heart. He spent the next few days getting poked, prodded, and scanned before finally being diagnosed with Stage IIIB Hodgkin lymphoma.
	My brother had cancer.
	Once my brother started chemotherapy, my shifts in the emergency department took on a whole new meaning. I had the most medical knowledge of anyone in my family and often translated jargon into layman’s terms for my parents; even with my years of clinical experience, however, I was little help when it came to hematology and oncology. Every day in the emergency department, I tried to learn something that would help me better understand my brother’s case. The doctors spent time teaching me after each shift, explaining the meanings of different lab values, physical exam findings, and even some radiological images. Perhaps more importantly, they showed me how to speak to people in immensely stressful situations. After watching the doctors interact with both patients and their loved ones, I adjusted my tone, vocabulary, and comportment when talking to my own family. Although balancing my full-time job and my brother’s care was immensely stressful, this period of my life cemented my decision to pursue a career in medicine.
	
	Six months of chemotherapy and three years later, my brother is officially in remission. I have spent the years since his treatment strengthening my skills so that I can be the best physician possible. Following some time away from clinical settings to study for the MCAT and protect my family from unnecessary COVID-19 exposure, I began working as a Medical Assistant at a dermatology office. I reveled in the opportunity to combine my scribing skills with direct patient care. I conducted patient intake interviews on my own, drawing from my previous clinical experience to ask the right questions. After years of observing doctors “do” medicine, I finally had the opportunity to assist with numerous biopsies—and I loved every moment of every procedure. From dermatology, I shifted my focus back to academia and pursued a Special Master’s in Physiology (SMP) at Georgetown University. This program allowed me to experience the academic rigor of the first year of medical school, reinforcing some of the concepts I had learned in college and introducing me to more complex physiological topics. Most importantly, my success in the SMP Program reinforced my belief that I am ready for medical school.
	Without my brother, I still would have wanted to become a doctor. His journey, however, was a catalyst for my decision to enter the medical field; now, I cannot think of anything more rewarding than pursuing a career in medicine. I believe I have proven that, given the opportunity, I am prepared to succeed in medical school and the medical field.","My family‚Äôs experience and cultural diversity has greatly shaped my views on multiculturalism. My grandfather, uncle, and aunt immigrated to the United States from India, Nicaragua, and Somalia, respectively. By growing up in such a diverse family, I learned at a young age that our cultural differences are what make each of us unique and interesting. My family members‚Äô life journeys have made me significantly more empathetic towards all immigrants, regardless of their country of origin or legal status. Moreover, my mixed-race, multicultural family taught me to appreciate and respect people who look, speak, and act differently than I do. As I grew older, I learned that many American families are not as diverse; most of my high school classmates grew up in culturally homogenous households, and some of my college friends grew up in all but segregated communities. I now realize how lucky I am to have grown up surrounded by such rich, varied cultures.","While I was Chief Scribe in the Virginia Hospital Center Emergency Department, the hospital changed its scribing program from individual scribes for physicians to a shared scribe model, where one or two scribes assisted all the providers. My fellow scribes and I were disappointed, as the new role offered us less clinical exposure. To ensure the shared scribe model would be as satisfying as one-to-one scribing, I surveyed the scribes and providers to identify potential tasks for shared scribes. I then explained how I envisioned the shared scribe model to the Department Chair: a mix of paging specialists, reviewing charts, preparing discharge instructions, and documenting patient encounters if time allowed. As a result of our meeting, the Department Chair developed a better understanding of the scribes‚Äô frustrations; from then on, he worked closely with me to improve the shared scribe model. Through our collaboration, we developed a successful scribing program that is still in use today.",,,1,"From late July 2020 until August 2021, I worked full-time as a Medical Assistant (MA) at Georgetown Dermatology, a private practice in Washington, DC.

I better understand the risks associated with working in healthcare during a global pandemic and the policies and practices meant to ensure the safety of patients and front-line workers. Perhaps most importantly, I gained tremendous respect for the physicians who worked tirelessly and selflessly to treat their patients through the pandemic.

The interventions that I received helped and eventually cured my condition, but it was the caring and attentive manner of my physician that impacted me the most and gave me the motivation to actively pursue the study of medicine to impact other people’s lives as a physician.
Over the last several years, I have gained a wide variety of clinical experiences and patient interaction that enhanced and solidified my interest in pursuing medicine. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of shadowing in The Johns Hopkins University Pediatric Operating Room. There I observed a wide-variety of cases and gained an appreciation for the teamwork required among health care providers before, during, and after the operations. For example, I saw that significant meticulous care and expert knowledge was applied in multi-physician operations such as interventions for scoliosis and saw the large positive impact that medicine can have in a relatively short amount of time. Not only was I exposed to the surgeries themselves, but also to how the physicians worked with and collaborated with others during their surgeries. It was very rewarding to see the patients recover and respond well to treatment in the recovery room as well. I implemented these principles of collaboration and attention to detail as a medical scribe in various medical clinics and specialties at the University of Miami. 
In addition, I had the privilege of shadowing Dr. Dileep Yavagal, who has become a mentor of mine in many ways. In his neuro-interventional suite I expanded my knowledge of neurology and experienced first-hand how neurologic interventions are perfomed for strokes and other vascular conditions. I was able to see how Dr. Yavagal intervened and improved the health of patients with technological advancements that were discovered to save people’s lives. This helped motivate my desire to not only practice medicine but perform research, as I have seen how research impacts and changes medicine to improve patient care. Experiencing Dr. Yavagal’s successful interventions for carotid disease and aneurysms, for instance, further inspired me, and reminded me of the great potential I have to one day help improve other people’s health as a physician. 
I also observed and engaged with patients in Dr. Hoover’s family practice clinic, where I helped to familiarize them with the clinic and developed a professional, compassionate rapport with them so that they were comfortable receiving care. I plan to serve people from all walks of life as a physician and this experience allowed me to grow and mature. I also observed as Dr. Hoover treated generations of a family and saw her caring bed-side manner when there was a passing or loss in a family. I plan to implement the same caring bed-side manner when I am working with patients. 
As a survivor of domestic abuse, I am also moved to help others that have gone through a similar devastating experience. I decided to volunteer in a woman’s shelter in my hometown that helps the underserved: Lotus House. During my two-and-a-half-year tenure as a weekly volunteer at Lotus House, I saw the positive impact I made in the lives of the children and mothers. I volunteered during the weekly children arts and crafts activity nights and with other women’s shelter activities throughout the year. I learned how to effectively discuss and teach various activities to the children, which is a skill that will translate to my future work as a pediatric physician. I could see the impact I was making on these children through their smiles and excitement. I look forward to making positive patient improvement and having similar positive interactions as a physician. I also taught children in Brain Fairs at the Miami Science Museum where I educated children of all ages about nerve impulse transmission. These interactions with children helped to supplement my clinical experience and solidified my aspirations of pursuing pediatric medicine. I plan to continue volunteering and serving not only the underserved in my hometown but on a larger national and eventually global scale as a physician.
Despite difficulties, I have not given up on difficult paths. My passion for medicine has driven me to persist through difficulties and seek applicable experiences on my road to medical school. I have seen how medicine has improved my own life further reinforcing my desire to serve others directly along with advancing science and medicine on a global scale through research as a physician-scientist.","While volunteering at Lotus House, a local women‚Äôs shelter in my community, I served people of diverse backgrounds different from my own, which allowed me to enhance my ability to understand those unlike myself. I taught and engaged with children and mothers from a wide variety of backgrounds, most notably African American and Hispanic. I connected and worked with all the children, and engaged with them in a loving, compassionate manner as I taught them the arts and crafts activity of the day. I also displayed patient and understanding if a tantrum, or the like, occurred. The children respected me and they worked well together despite their differences. I enjoyed seeing the children grow and mature week after week and became more comfortable teaching them the arts and crafts activity of the day. As time passed, I became more confident with working and engaging with the children of all backgrounds, and I plan to do the same in the future as a pediatric physician. ","While volunteering at West Kendall Baptist Hospital in Miami, FL, I noticed that there was a patient who did not have any visitors. On the weekend, I got flowers and went to visit with the older gentleman for a few minutes. He was very moved, and I was glad to have made a positive difference in someone‚Äôs life. On a larger scale, I had the opportunity to impact the community at Lotus House, a women‚Äôs shelter in my community of Miami, FL. Once a week, I taught the children the arts and crafts activity of the day. In the time that I had with the children I was satisfied that I was able to assist in giving them a nurturing, safe environment to learn and explore. Seeing the children run to me to greet me or smile and welcome me week after week was very rewarding. This experience helped to solidify my aspirations of pursuing pediatric medicine. I plan to implement the same compassionate manner at the bedside with my future patients.",,,1,,1,0,2

After a stroke she had in 2004, my mom lost her job as the director of nursing and required unemployment for one year. My siblings and I needed jobs to pay for their phone bills, vehicles, car insurance, school trips, etc. We had reduced lunches at school. I started working at the age of 14 as a paperboy, then at McDonald's once I turned 16, the required age to begin in New York. During college, my mother tried to create a dog breeding business along with her day job to afford to send my siblings and me to college. We still require additional financing from my uncle and grandparents to pay for school. I had also spent a lot of time working rather than studying in college, and during the summer, I held jobs close to home because I couldn't afford to live where I could find an opportunity to shadow. There was no public transport in my hometown, and the closest hospital was over 10 miles away.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,8188,50.0,300.0,59.0,6280.0,,1,359,1,6580,06/17/2022,University of Rochester,Microbiology / Bacteriology,0,,Yes,No,Yes,"$75,000 - 99,999",6,1,1,0,0.0,83.0,12.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,15,Adequate,2,2023,1,5.0,0.0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,"From an early age, I knew that healthcare workers had to be dedicated to their patients as well as team members of a larger healthcare system. My mother, a director of nursing, brought home stories of her time as an ER nurse and times she had to discipline employees for failing to follow protocol, putting patients in danger. As I grew older and listened it was clear that she dedicated herself to the patients she cared for and the staff members that she managed. Similarly, I depended on my mom. If I needed to go to the doctor, she helped me. If I was saving up to go on a trip, I anticipated that she would help me out if I didn't have enough money for gas. This dependent relationship is so normal it goes unrecognized until it's gone. In 2016, she suddenly passed away. She was both the breadwinner and the only good relationship I had with a parent; I was forced every second to recognize her absence in almost every aspect of my life. Her caregiving skills allowed her to excel both in medicine and as a parent. 
My mom died in the middle of my college career, leaving me alone and no longer with a safety net. After finishing my degree, I was broke. A family friend sold me a 2002 Saturn for $200, whose muffler would soon fall off, to start a job in Arlington as a medical assistant at a dermatologist. I had borrowed more money to pay for the first month's rent plus the security deposit, and luckily my soon-to-be roommate agreed to the cheapest apartment. I even had to buy the most affordable mattress off Facebook marketplace, strap it to my car, and carefully drive down the highway for 30 minutes for something to sleep on. After working for a bit, I worked myself up to a slightly better-paying job. Since my car was impounded soon after I was hired, I was fortunate that I could commute via public transportation. This independence forced me to be disciplined, sacrifice, and improvise when dealing with limited options. I stopped wasting money such as going out to eat, developed healthy workout habits, and followed through on commitments that I made to both others and myself. If I wanted to pursue medical school, I needed to excel at my job and study for the MCAT. My solitude and work environment matured me by instilling better time management and prioritization of my pursuit in medicine. It is these qualities that lead to my success at my job and in graduate school. 
After finding some stability, I've no longer become reliant but someone to depend on. I picked up a job as a tutor for extra income not realizing how important it would be. I first noticed how far I had come in my relationship with a student that I tutored. The inherent dynamic between the tutor and the student is that they expect you to be knowledgeable and make little to no mistakes. This was the innate aspect of my relationship with Jake. Beyond this expectation, we learned about each other's idiosyncrasies, hobbies, and even favorite music, which made the teaching process feel more natural and ultimately helped him learn more than if we were strictly business. Jake started a ritual of playing each of our favorite songs before we began our sessions. I believe that these little exchanges established trust beyond the built-in confidence that a tutee has for their tutor. We didn't exclusively discuss his homework problems but also his habits and study schedules that worked around his hobbies. This relationship allowed for a better understanding if he was having a rough week and how it affected his schoolwork. And when he scored well, we celebrated together.  
Soon after came another win, as my bosses promoted me to a clinical manager role. It became even more clear that others had appreciated my personal growth and trusted me with the responsibility associated with the position. In this new role, I recognized how much patients count on health care workers flawlessly completing their jobs. A patient's biopsy was missing after a passive medical assistant ignored protocol. After a few calls between myself, the patient, and the doctor, getting the patient to come back to the office and confide their health at our practice again was a challenge. I spent countless hours focusing on other tasks to enhance the quality of patient care we provided. Among other protocols, I reinvented our procedure to recount biopsies to avoid another incident. I created a comprehensive training protocol after a medical assistant incorrectly administered local anesthesia to a patient. I wasn't just responsible for myself; My coworkers, bosses, providers at my practice, and patients required that I be meticulous, disciplined, and adaptable.  
Relationships often come with fundamental expectations that can often be taken for granted. It is further shaped by how people live up to these expectations. It is the acknowledgment of these struggles that creates a unique relationship between medical staff and patients. Patients unreservedly leave themselves and their health in our hands, and it is the medical staff's responsibility to work tirelessly to justify that faith. Not every career has such a bond; I am grateful that my path is built on that concept. My life experience will be integral to my execution of that responsibility.","Although I am personally not part of a marginalized community, I have watched discrimination occur and stand up to any exclusionary behaviors. Growing up in a rural, low-income area, I learned about people when I went to college. One of the most formative parts of my undergraduate was joining the debate team. During the debate, you were assigned a position on a prompt that can range from world conflicts to social justice. The best part was that success required you to argue a position you may not personally hold. This allowed me to step outside the view I grew up with and have a critical lens of the belief system I once knew. It inspired me to join other student groups because I wanted to learn from people from different backgrounds. As a biologics coordinator, I often had to fight for patients against insurance companies to cover medications. I understood how a patient's condition affected their life and how their financial situation impeded their ability to get these medications. ","Another formative experience in my undergrad was spearheading a project to make the campus more accessible to people with disabilities. In addition to my love medicine, my passion is helping others and fighting for a larger cause. Growing up, my grandmother was wheelchair-bound due to her multiple sclerosis. I remember the difficulties we went through in restaurants and other spaces for her to even be ther. I had the chance to help people with disabilities on a larger scale during my Student Government work. It was rewarding to interact with students and faculty and hear about how their disabilities shaped their campus experience and their idea to improve our campus. We conducted a tour of the campus to document which spaces need renovation to be wheelchair friendly, beyond ADA guidelines and updated the accessibility map to include all doors that are wheelchair accessible and inclines that were considered too steep to be added to the map.",,,1,,1,1,1
2023,14501781,,28,Man,USA,1,EO1,0,1,"I grew up in a multigenerational household where my mother worked as a house cleaner to support my disabled brother and me. I am also a child of divorce. I found myself working from eight years old to help my father stay afloat while simultaneously assisting to care for my brother, splitting time between both households. Both my father's and brother's physical disabilities put a ton of strain on our family economically. We did not have much monetary means but at a young age that didn't bother me. I always qualified for free lunch programs, but so did many of my close personal friends. Yet as I grew older and moved through the public school system in the bay area, I became more and more aware of the stark socioeconomic gradients that were present. 

I am the first person in my family to attend a four-year college institution. As such I have covered a great distance academically. Early on I struggled with learning how to ask for help, which stems from a high degree of responsibility placed on my shoulders from a young age. As a first-generation college student, I seek to succeed not only for myself but for my family and community.

Engaging with Spanish-speaking only recent arrivals from Mexico and Central America, many of whom shared stories of homelessness, human trafficking, and the pursuit for better opportunities. I was made a student to their struggles, informing my perspectives of what community medicine can and ought to be. I knew I belonged in medicine as the hours would bleed away effortlessly as I carried out my work: Spanish translation, taking vital signs, and advocating the needs of patients alongside medical students and preceptors. In the twenty-five months I spent as a member of clínica, I found a sense of purpose, challenge, and agency in the service to my community. It is this aspiration to lead a fulfilling and uplifting life that pushes me forward in the pursuit of primary care medicine. 
 
My wealth of unorthodox and difficult family experiences have enhanced my ability to connect with a wide variety of underserved populations. I grew up in my grandparents’ home in Santa Clara in a multi-generational working-class Mexican-American household. I was raised in a collective effort by my mother, grandmother, disabled father, and others. I worked in the family business throughout my childhood, waking up at 3:30 AM to go set up and sell at local flea markets with my father, arriving back home again well past dark. Growing up in such an environment I developed a firm work ethic, family values, and a strong sense of racial identity. I am a child of alcoholics, a child of divorce, and the son of a Navy veteran grappling with PTSD and homelessness. From these lived experiences I gain understanding and compassion for the daily struggles and trauma which often go unnoticed. While such themes as substance abuse, illness, and trauma have informed my understanding of empathy and care indirectly, my struggles growing up have taught me resilience.  
 
The youngest of four brothers, for the first seventeen years of my life I witnessed my older brother's battle with Psoriatic Arthritis and substance abuse. I internalized his struggles and they, above all else, have led me to Medicine. I had to watch the police take my brother away from me in handcuffs, and I witnessed him try to put the pieces of his life back together again. Every time he would take a step forward, the progression of his disease would push him two steps back. My brother struggles to walk most days, his pain is constant, and depression his companion. Late at night, I would hear my brother’s labored dry heaving in the bathroom on the other side of the wall. The sound of exhausted retching and blood mixed with his tears broke my heart. The most honest answer I can give as to why I want to be a physician is that somewhere rooted in the shadow of my childhood is a deep desire to fix my brother so that he too could lead a normal life one day. I now know this ideal to be unrealistic, of “fixing” my brother to be lacking in nuance and impossible per se. But the spirit of it remains the same: Striving to meet others where they are, to relieve suffering, and promote wellness.
 
Young men from my community, the neighborhood where I come from, don’t leave. Many don’t pursue higher education, and end up cemented in place, or worse. I left directly from high school to a four-year undergraduate institution before I was ready. In those days the opportunity to move away, to live in a new city and open a new chapter in my life, was my only way to escape my situation. My brother was severely verbally and emotionally abusive throughout my childhood. I have in the past akin the environment at home to that of a battlefield. Harsh and ugly words pouring out like chlorine gas, smashing plates-slamming doors like hand grenades. I moved to San Francisco for college. Free of the abuse in my home environment I came to better know myself and thrive. Educationally I have covered a great distance, having made mistakes along the way. I felt I was playing catch up to many of my peers early in my college career as I struggled to adjust to university workloads and learning how to study. The path that I chose when looked at in conjunction with  the growing pains associated with years of emotional and verbal abuse was not easy, but it carried me to this point, and that has made all the difference.   
 
University exposed me to an education rooted in Ethnic Studies. Developing a unique understanding of its paradigms and application in relation to intersectionality and social stratification of underserved communities both in the United States and globally. Through my undergraduate institution, I moved to Spain at the age of nineteen, and discovered an unbounded passion for travel, intercultural communication, and connection. My years abroad in both Spain and Mexico have made me a lifelong learner. I look forward to bringing this diversity of experience into the medical field.","I grew up along the intersection of my older brother‚Äôs substance abuse, my father‚Äôs untreated PTSD, and my mom‚Äôs sobriety. I saw my father lose everything, living out of an old 02‚Äô Dodge van in front of a grocery store. My brother was taken away from me in handcuffs in elementary school. I grew up bi-racial, pulled between questions of self-identity and values, fighting off stereotypes transposed upon me by society at large. The intersectionality in my identity and my lived experiences have given me insight into the struggles of many different communities sharing these insights would benefit many of my peers in this year‚Äôs class. The depth and breadth of experiences I have lived are my teachers, my greatest strength. The things I have walked through with my family have taught me more than any college class ever did. I hope to share this with my classmates and the communities I work in, I hope they may take the good and leave the rest. I have lived in Mexico and Spain for a year each.","My experience working in a safety net clinic serving Spanish-speaking only, recent arrivals from Mexico and Central America alongside preceptors, medical students, and undergraduate volunteers showed me firsthand the transformative power of community-first collaborative medicine. It reinforced my commitment to creating more equitable access to healthcare for migrant populations, Spanish-speaking only communities, unhoused, and other underserved populations. As volunteers at Clin√≠ca Mart√≠n-Bar√≥, our work directly benefitted the community by providing access to a free community food bank, free clothing and winter coat closet, free mental health services, free prescription drug access, and free basic health care services. Furthermore, our clin√≠ca created a safe space for patients to come together and organize community initiatives, and share resources. I believe that sustainable and impactful health promotion can be created in working with community partners and empowering the patient.

My favorite aspect of my role as a research assistant at Stanford was administering neurocognitive assessments to elderly populations. With the onset of the pandemic, all of our in-person work with elderly populations was suspended. We also saw a complete removal of the hands-on polysomnography projects with youth. I transitioned to working exclusively from home during my final seven months as an active lab member, which provided me with an opportunity to work on a review paper on sleep medicine. Due to the pandemic, my only option to complete the Organic Chemistry II Laboratory requirement was online.

It was an enlightening film which explored the themes of transformation and bettering people’s lives. Like Amelie, I too wanted to create happiness in all those who surround me. The following year, I suffered my first setback when I witnessed my grandfather’s battle with cancer. Fueled by the emotions that followed, I wrote a scathing satire of my misconception that physicians were all powerful beings. As I matured, I used writing as a conduit to further understand illness, injury, and recovery. I wrote a poem about the fleeting yet precious nature of life after I protected my brother from a firearm. I wrote a script about a pirate with a peg-leg modeled after Pirates of the Caribbean after I suffered a ligament tear in soccer followed by a happy alternative ending to the Butterfly Effect after hearing about a classmate’s rebound from depression. Writing allowed me to materialize my evolving understanding of medicine and gave me the strength to move past both the physical trauma of my injury and the emotional trauma of losing my grandfather. 
As my writing matured, I began to approach life with a broader perspective and a newfound desire to serve. In college, I was accompanying a patient as part of the No One Dies Alone initiative. His demeanor was peppery as if scolding a child and his jokes, while well-intentioned, were laced with racial slurs and cut deep. Yet the crackle in his voice and the tears in his eyes betrayed his feelings of fear, regret, and sadness upon being informed that his family could not arrive in time. As I sat silently through the night, I watched the physicians and nurses in their constant efforts to reduce his discomfort and ease his passing. At the end of my shift, his eyes reflected a tranquil acceptance of his condition and he smiled with a warm gratitude as he gazed at each of us in turn. Touched by the immeasurable difference that we had made, I reconciled my childhood misconception of doctors to realize their true identity as guardians and leaders dedicated to helping others.
Being in the presence of patients and witnessing their struggles showed me the tremendous feats that physicians could  accomplish while also painfully reminding me of the limits of medicine. The weight of that patient’s passing strengthened my resolve to bring medicine to new heights by becoming a physician leader. I redoubled my efforts in academics and in extracurriculars with the goal of pioneering discovery rather than following the trodden path. I decided to major in Electrical Engineering with the hope of combining technology and medicine to formulate creative solutions to tomorrow’s challenges. My experiences abroad shaped me into a holistic student and taught me that medical advancement is closely linked with scientific research. Exposure to a diverse array of research projects has helped me develop a multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving while also providing a  gateway to explore innovation through novel fields like tissue engineering and robotic prosthesis.
As I continue my medical education, I hope to adopt a comprehensive approach to patient care. As the treatments for illness and injury continue to evolve, the tasks and responsibilities of physicians will change alongside them. But regardless of how technologically advanced our treatments become, I believe that medicine cannot exist without empathy. Critically, working at a community health clinic and serving as part of Food Recovery Heroes showed me the unique obstacles that disadvantaged populations face. While I wish to mediate the marriage of health and technology I will do so without sacrificing humanity and compassion in our increasingly data-driven world. Above all, I look forward to continued practice during my medical training and onwards to ensure that the patient and the person below them can achieve trust and understanding through the sacred patient-physician relationship.","Working at Access Community Health provided a glimpse into the inner workings of Federally Qualified Health Clinics (FQHCs) and their essential role in healthy communities. 80% of our patients are on Medicare and over 40% identify as homeless. I was in charge of calling patients to schedule them for appointments. Through conversing with my coworker who was a DACA recipient originally from Mexico, I was able to learn a bit of Spanish. I utilized this powerful tool to communicate and connect with Spanish-speaking patients when an interpreter was not available. Through sharing our experiences, I learned of the obstacles many Hispanic patients had faced in their journey to the US. I was humbled by their integrity and kindness. As a result, I gained understanding of the trials and tribulations of undocumented immigrants especially in regards to their language, healthcare and employment barriers.","As a resident assistant, I connected with a freshman who told me of his difficulty with acceptance as an African-American at a predominantly white college and of his perceived alienation from the floor due to his different background. I was taken by surprise as this resident had run for Student Government and had participated in multiple campus and building programs. I realized that the barriers to inclusion are often complex and hidden beneath the surface. When I dug deeper, he confided that the primary cause for his difficulty in socializing was his low self-esteem which stemmed from his strained relationship with his mother. Throughout our conversation, I recognized his bravery and kindness. I told him that our struggles make us unique and that everyone on the floor saw him as a friend. I encouraged his desire to reconcile his goals with his mother‚Äôs expectations which resulted in his inclusion within the floor and his embrace of his identity.",,,1,"The COVID era proved to be the most emotionally, mentally and physically challenging time of my life thus far. My family was hit extremely hard and various friends and acquaintances cut ties with me due to my race. I developed insomnia from working the graveyard shift at lab and the graduate student who had been assigned as my mentor dismissed my project as futile and even went so far as to tell me to look for another job. After my failure to be accepted to medical school in 2020, my parents recommended that I change my career. Collectively, these events greatly demoralized me and I reached a low where I needed to reassess my goal of becoming a physician. However, I stayed true and believed in myself even when the world did not believe in me. By persevering through adversity, I cemented my commitment to medicine and rekindled the burning passion which first set me upon this path.",1,0,1

Our conversation touched me; my mother had experienced the same sense of helplessness when, at the same age, I was diagnosed with lichens sclerosus atrophicus, a rare skin condition. Like Mira, my mother was wrought with anxiety, with the words ""no cure"" glaring at her as she searched for information about my alien-sounding disease online. My mother tried to shield her concerns from me, but for the first time in my life, I knew she had no solution.

Our anxiety began to subside six months later when we met Dr. Frieden at UCSF. She was approachable and used superhero analogies to explain how my immune cells were causing my disease instead of protecting me. Still, I felt shaken— betrayed by my own body. To ease my distress, Dr. Frieden encouraged my mother to plan fun activities after my visits. As my treatment took effect, memories of ice cream at Ghirardelli Square overshadowed those of the hospital.

Fifteen years later, as a Patient Navigator at the National Psoriasis Foundation, I shared this approach with Mira. With resources and support, I watched her transform from a fearful parent into an empowered advocate for her daughter's health. The desire to share knowledge and build resilience in others is central to my pursuit of becoming a physician. I fulfill this goal on a small scale now, but only as a physician can I fully achieve it by guiding my patients' treatment journey from start to finish.

I first became seriously interested in medicine when I met an endocrinologist at a high school biology conference. I was moved by her role in helping a young diabetic athlete overcome his fear of hypoglycemia through participation in a clinical trial, investigating a new insulin pump. Until then, I had assumed that research was limited to poring over microscopes. Seeing that advancements in medicine could be used as a tool to build patient resilience motivated me to accept a position as an ENT Clinical Research Assistant in college.

On my first day in this role, I met Dr. Javer as he rushed into the ENT ward's cramped lunchroom, still in his scrubs after a 16-hour day. I was captivated by his enthusiasm as he gathered our diverse team of fellows, surgeons, and medical students. Over the next few years, we garnered academic recognition for our research on novel sinus disease treatments. But when I interviewed patients to assess their understanding of these same treatments, their blank expressions prompted me to re-evaluate the success of our research. Feeling a responsibility to ensure our studies reached our patients, I designed a pamphlet that summarized our findings in layman's terms. Dr. Javer shared my excitement as patients began referencing the pamphlet and asking more informed questions. This initiative instilled in me a passion for science communication and informed the type of physician I want to be—a bridge between cutting-edge research and the patients in my exam room.

This passion and my early interest in clinical trials led me to join Dr. Blauvelt in conducting dermatology clinical trials. I was proud to play a role in educating patients and building resilience by connecting them to front-line treatments. It seemed like our clinic reached the most underserved patients as we combated barriers posed by cost and poor health literacy. My belief was challenged when I met ""Mo,"" an elderly Black patient who detailed a lifetime of eczema diagnoses. When Dr. Blauvelt diagnosed him with psoriasis instead, he furiously shook his head in disbelief. ""That explains why my treatments failed,"" he remarked. To my dismay, I quickly realized that his experience was commonplace. I often encountered previously misdiagnosed patients and learned that medical knowledge of how diseases impact skin of color remains scarce.

These interactions left me determined to educate myself on this issue. I combed through medical textbooks for more information, but my research fell short, as I only found a handful of images featuring patients with skin of color. It was clear that this was a systemic issue, requiring widespread patient and physician education. A few months later, my commitment to addressing this issue led me to my current role at the National Psoriasis Foundation, where I have created and shared resources on psoriasis in skin of color. As a physician, I look forward to furthering my efforts by influencing change at the highest level. I will strive to bring awareness to the impacts of the social determinants of health beyond financial and educational barriers.

I aspire to be a physician who will form meaningful, long-term relationships with my patients and play a vital role in guiding their unique treatment journeys. My experiences as a patient, researcher, and navigator have reinforced my drive to support others in making informed health choices, which can only be achieved to the fullest as a physician. Furthermore, interacting with diverse patients, like Mo, has instilled in me the importance of breaking down barriers that prevent access to care. As a physician, I will proudly uphold my duty to act on these lessons, pushing the boundaries of current approaches to health care.","I am a first-generation Indian-American-Canadian, who was born in San Francisco, spent her middle school years in Delhi, immigrated to Vancouver, BC at age 12, and now lives in Portland.

As a new fourth-grade student in Delhi, I recall making friends by sharing my traditions like trick-or-treating on Halloween. In return, my classmates taught me Hindi at lunchtime as we scarfed down PBJs and paranthas. _x000D_

These early experiences cultivated a lifelong commitment to diversity and inclusion. In college, I hosted celebrations such as Pride and Eid, where students connected through shared experiences. Recently, my advocacy for the needs of BIPOC patients led to a collaboration with Dr. Tiffany Mayo to create resources on psoriasis symptoms in black patients. I hope to share my experiences with peers at RMC to promote inclusivity in our student body and patient population.","While working as a Clinical Trials Research Assistant, I met with ""Alma,"" a Spanish-only speaking patient with severe vitiligo who was an excellent candidate for an active study. Unfortunately, since she required a translator to review the informed consent form, she could not enroll in the trial. When I approached my colleagues to request a translator, I was initially met with resistance as they shared that trial sponsors rarely agreed to pay for this service. Disappointed by this information, I urged Alma to return with an English-speaking caregiver. Fortunately, she did; and enrolled in the trial a few days later. However, most minority patients are not as lucky. _x000D_

Despite these setbacks, working as a Patient Navigator during the pandemic prepared me to help patients make informed health decisions and address disparities in healthcare in medical school and beyond. I shared up-to-date information with psoriatic disease patients concerned about the safety of vaccines and the risk of psoriasis flares after COVID-19 infection. I also assisted patients with scheduling vaccine appointments to combat disparities in vaccine registration caused by poor access to digital resources.

2023,14555162,,25,Man,USA,1,EO1,0,1,"I was born in Lebanon and later moved to Glendale, CA, fleeing war and uncertain economic conditions. Knowing very little English, it was very tough to both assimilate into a new culture and learn a new language at the same time. After arriving to the US, our family lived in a studio guest house in the back of my uncle's house. We were able to move out into a small apartment, but it required continued financial assistance from my uncle and my dad working two jobs 7 days a week, delivering pizza and the odd photography job. The financial stress put an increased strain on my parents' marriage, sometimes resulting in violence. I served as a second caretaker for my younger sister, and I would take her on bike rides every time my parents fought to shield her from those experiences. Eventually, my parents got divorced and my mom started working longer hours as a dental hygienist, which required me to take my sister to school, cook for us, and babysit her after school. Growing up in a single family household was very tough financially. My father is still struggling and is on food stamps. He is working as a pizza deliveryman with COVID having devastated his photography business. Furthermore, since I am the first person in my family to attend college, I had no guidance on SAT preparation and college admissions.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,13299,674.0,966.0,524.0,470.0,160.0,1,1490,1,1596,09/10/2021,University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,Biology,0,,Yes,No,No,"Less than $25,000",4,1,1,1,38.0,58.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,17,Significant,3,2023,3,3.0,0.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"Heroes come in all shapes and sizes. When I was 7, a small, stubborn Toyota saved my life. On one of our trips to the local Lebanese bakery in Beirut, my grandpa parked the car in front of the bakery. In a flash, we heard an explosion so loud that it smashed the windows of our car, the shrapnel making Swiss cheese out of our Toyota. The car shielded us, we were dazed and confused, but alive.

We were rushed to the local hospital, which was swamped with critically wounded patients. My grandfather lost a chunk of his calf, and I remember the horrific chaos and feeling utterly hopeless. But like angels dressed in white, I witnessed valiant doctors zooming from one patient to another. To my childhood eyes, they were heroes wearing white capes. In the midst of utter despair, there was reason to hope. I knew right then, that’s what I wanted to be, a physician.

As conditions worsened in Lebanon, my father relocated us to Glendale, CA in a small apartment. We became refugees with poor English skills and nothing to our name. When my parents divorced, I took on the additional responsibility of taking care of my younger sister. Through my experiences in Lebanon and in Los Angeles, I was thrust into adulthood at an early age. While my childhood was challenging, the hardships and extra responsibility made me a creative problem solver and determined change-maker.

I carried this attitude to college where I started a new fraternity focused on diversity and community service. While I fulfilled my goal of creating a unique community, I also took on the added responsibility of managing finances and human resources while adjusting to the rigorous academic environment at University of Michigan. Our fraternity was very involved in philanthropy, working with organizations such as NAMI and Autism Alliance. I am proud that something that I created has done so much good and continues to do so.

At the same time, my family was struggling financially. So I turned my lifetime hobby of DJing into a job and worked almost every weekend to make some money. It was challenging to balance academics with extracurriculars and my work; however, I thrived with the added workload. Covid made my senior year more difficult, and I was forced to scale back my philanthropic efforts, as well my DJing. After graduation, I worked full time as well as some weekends and most holidays at my family's jewelry business. Through it all, what has kept me going is a realization that life becomes meaningful when it is used to help others; that the character and values are strengthened through overcoming hardships. So when opportunities to contribute dried up at home, I decided to volunteer internationally.

While volunteering at Wigmore Orthopedic Clinic in Armenia, I have come across countless patients who are living in abject poverty. Over the last six months, we have taken regular trips to the rural villages and provided free care to orphaned children who are suffering from physical disabilities. This was the only medical intervention these kids ever experienced. Working with an underserved community and providing care to a population that cannot advocate for themselves, I felt like I was making a significant difference. Moreover, in the pediatric population, early intervention can make a large impact in their health outcomes later on in life. I am very passionate about helping kids neglected by society; I want to provide compassion and hope to ease their suffering the same way I experienced as a child.

Simultaneously, I have been working with Frontline Therapists in Armenia, an organization dedicated to helping war veterans. I was immediately drawn to it for two reasons: most of these soldiers were from villages with no mental health resources; and secondly, I understood that trauma can leave profound marks on one’s soul. All too often, I saw the “thousand-mile stare”: young soldiers, in the space of a few months, experiencing a lifetime of grief, violence and misery. While war has devastated Armenia, I see a similar tragedy in the US. Volunteering at a shelter in inner city LA, I see homeless who trudge through the food lines with the same exhausted, blank looks. Like war refugees, they live in tents in the streets, surrounded by used syringes instead of mines. I met an 18-yr old male who told me about his cocaine habit, “I don’t use it because I’m addicted, I use it to stay awake so I don’t get raped.” The homeless live in extreme conditions and suffer from PTSD that comes from unspeakable trauma. Having worked with these underserved populations firsthand, I am very motivated to help them. I want to make a large impact as a physician and provide care to those on the fringes of society.

I believe a hero is anyone intent on making this world a better place. I know all too well the devastations of war including the displacement it causes and the childhood trauma. Through witnessing these horrors, the tragedy of homelessness and experiencing hardships, I have seen despair. Yet, I am filled with hope and optimism. I have also seen the myriad of ways in which one can ease someone’s suffering. That’s what those physicians were to me after that bombing. I want to one day be able to put on my white cape and continue to fight for those in need.","I started my sophomore year at a new high school where I was the only Arab student. It was not long before I was ostracized for being different. ‚ÄúTowel head,‚Äù my swim teammates would say while wrapping towels above their foreheads. I wanted to belong, but it was difficult to ignore their racist remarks. At first, I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with the bullying and I was considering switching schools. Then I realized that they were bullying me because they didn‚Äôt know anything about me or my culture. So, I invited some teammates over for dinner, where my mom cooked a traditional Lebanese feast. They agreed and this was the beginning of a cultural bridge that would continue to be built for years to come. I carried this attitude into college where I minored in Judaic Studies, eager to expand my cultural competence. Every individual has unique experiences and perspectives and I feel that in order to cultivate a cooperative environment, acknowledgement of these differences is crucial.","In my time volunteering in Armenia, I felt I made a difference working with Frontline Therapists. Mental health is a taboo topic in Armenia and, as a result, mental health services are scarce in the country. This reality was apparent when I started helping the young soldiers in our art therapy sessions. Given the cultural stance on mental health and the strict adherence to traditional gender roles in Armenia, these young men were reluctant to participate in any form of therapy, noting that it‚Äôs ‚Äúfor the weak.‚Äù Despite the language barrier, I was able to connect with them and show them that engaging in therapy is a positive thing and nothing to be ashamed of. I am proud that I helped so many soldiers in their journey to improving their mental health, as well as increasing the awareness and access to mental health resources in the most underserved areas in the country. I also learned the importance of providing medical education in keeping a population healthy.",,,1,"When the Covid-19 pandemic started during my senior year of undergrad, my family‚Äôs jewelry business was devastated. I spent a year working 60-70 hour weeks while studying for the MCAT. Philanthropic opportunities were scarce during this time so I looked for creative ways to continue serving communities in need, which led me to Armenia. For six months, I worked with children at a pediatric orthopedic clinic and counseled veterans at a mental health non-profit focused on soldiers with PTSD. These experiences have not only made me more culturally sensitive, but have also humbled me. The resilience of the patients I encountered and their struggles through poverty and disease is what inspires me to be a socially accountable physician. In the past two years, my personal growth through these experiences has made me a much more informed and motivated medical school applicant.",1,0,2

Adam!” The sound of retching came from the other side of the house. Bursting through the bedroom door, I see my mother holding my grandmother in the fetal position on the bed. My grandmother was vomiting blood onto a towel. The look of terror on my mother’s face, combined with the image of the red blood on the light green towel, is something I will never forget. Time seemed to stop as I relayed information to EMS while attending to my grandmother. Once EMS arrived, the next moments flew by in a blur. My grandmother was loaded onto a bright yellow backboard, taken out the front door, and loaded into the ambulance. Lights flashed and sirens screeched as they rushed to the hospital. That was Christmas morning, 2015. 

Over the next few weeks, I did my best to interpret the medical jargon, but there was nothing more that I could do. The physicians and nurses were unequivocally focused on my family and our concerns. It was as if nothing else in the world was as important as my family. I hung to their every word. Ultimately, my grandmother passed that following February and what stuck with me were the conversations I had in that ICU room. I was shaken to my core and subsequently began to reflect on many of my decisions in life. A career in chemical engineering was supposed to be my way of making a difference in the world, but something was missing. What role could I play so that other people might find refuge during the storms of their lives like I did with those nurses and physicians?

The summer following my grandmother’s passing was the same summer I spent volunteering in the Bahamas. I had hoped to have a mental reset from the past couple of years of tribulations, but it became so much more. One of the most important responsibilities in my position was the constant monitoring of the health and safety of the visiting volunteers. During orientations and days at the job sites, I often used the phrase, “7 hours.” It was a simple reminder and a word of caution denoting the time necessary for an emergency medical evacuation to the nearest major hospital in the states. One day during a roofing project, I heard a crash from behind me. I turned to see that “Emily” had fallen and put her leg through a soft spot in the roof. We locked eyes, and I saw the fear she was trying to contain. All that came to mind was “7 hours.” Sitting down next to her, we began to breathe together slowly. Her face began to soften. Another volunteer and I freed Emily’s leg and were able to lower her down the ladder. Gathering the chaperones, I informed them that Emily did not seem to have any serious injuries, but the next several hours would be crucial. We agreed to let her rest and closely monitor her progress. Luckily, Emily could gingerly walk the following day and eventually flew home without complications. It was thrilling to get the news that she had safely landed back home. There was something that spoke to me at that moment. This brief practice of healthcare was incredible. Maybe this was what I was missing.

The next summer, I was renting kayaks at a nature center when I heard the park’s UTV barreling in my direction. Park ranger “Ben” informed me that a boy had wrecked on one of the trails and needed help. When we reached the wreck, “Aaron” was crying on the ground and holding his arm. His friend, “Tyler,” was frantically pacing the trail next to him. Through the tears, Aaron informed me of a loud pop during the crash, followed by a lot of pain in his right arm. I had heard that pop and felt that pain. I had broken my arm in the same place when I was Aaron’s age. The fear I had felt was the same fear that Aaron was feeling. My heart was racing. The only thing I could think to do was to tell the story of my broken arm. When I finished my story, Aaron had stopped crying, and everyone else had calmed down too. We loaded the boys and their bikes into the UTV and headed back down the trail. Tyler’s mom was anxiously waiting for us in the parking lot and was relieved to hear that everyone was relatively alright. As their black SUV disappeared behind the trees, I remembered the ER physician who cared for me. Would the same physician see Aaron? As I reminisced on my experience, I realized I wanted to do this every day. I wanted to become the physician that would see the next Aaron with his broken arm, the next Emily with her sprained ankle, and the next grandmother with the scared family.  

We all experience storms in our lives. Sometimes we get a little damaged. Sometimes we get a little lost, but that is when the lighthouses break through the clouds to guide us back to land. The physicians in my grandmother’s ICU were my lighthouses, and I had the incredible opportunity to be a lighthouse for Emily and Aaron. Now when I see patients in the hospital and the clinic experiencing their own storms, I can be their guide as a small lighthouse in their day. These moments are what truly inspire me to continue down the path of becoming the physician that I want to be in the future. Ultimately, I hope to use all the knowledge, expertise, and technology available to me as a physician to build my lighthouse and others as tall and bright as possible to guide many more lost boats back home, no matter how rough the seas may be.","During my master‚Äôs program, I lived with a former coworker who was also in the master‚Äôs program. ‚ÄúAden‚Äù and I had been rock climbing a few times and living together seemed like a logical decision. When the unrest in Yemen had reached a peak in early 2020, I had the opportunity to sit down with Aden and his father. We discussed the politics of the war in Yemen and how Aden‚Äôs father moved his family out of Yemen to the U.S. shortly after Aden was born. During that conversation, I learned a great deal about Aden‚Äôs family and their culture. Aden‚Äôs tendencies that annoyed me were just cultural differences that we eventually embraced. Because of this conversation and many others with Aden, I am now more aware of my own biases toward people I do not yet know. Aden and I grew very close that year, and his friendship is still incredibly important to me today. His perspective is so different than my own, and I love being able to have such open conversations with him whenever we can catch up.","During the stages of my transition from volunteer to volunteer coordinator, I was tasked with developing the relationship between our clinic and a newly opened dental school. The community of East Knoxville has been in desperate need of a center for oral care for quite some time, and our clinic could be a pivotal location. Renovations began and the details were discussed at length. When the volunteers put out the word, our number of daily patients grew by almost 30% in a few weeks. Patients could now see a medical physician and a dentist for free on the same day. I can still see ‚ÄúMs. Jones‚Äôs‚Äù face after her first evaluation. She looked at me with the biggest smile and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting new teeth!‚Äù Ms. Jones will receive her new dentures in a couple of months.

Upon completing my master‚Äôs program, the world was still shut down which made for the perfect MCAT studying environment. However, I decided to postpone my most recent application cycle to recover from my previous application cycle. This allowed me to deal with some family financial issues and gain more clinical experience during a monumental time in human history. Seeing the pandemic from inside the hospital as a nursing assistant was quite incredible. I am now only more motivated to become the physician that my local and global communities need.",1,0,2

I have experienced living in a country that doesn’t give much access to opportunity. I think about this a lot. About how fortunate I am to be in a position where exploring my passions is a possibility. Having emigrated from the Dominican Republic, my childhood was untraditional. I lived in a predominately rural environment where farm steading was very common. Coming to the United Sates was not an easy journey for me, or my family. Looking back at the financial and cultural hardships my parents faced, I am fortunate to have been raised in this environment. Being foreign-born also comes with its share of advantages, for example the necessity to seize opportunity. A drive that is synonymous with “The American Dream.” As such, I never felt I was at a disadvantage. More so, I benefited from having to work harder to reach the goals I set for myself. I learned how to be persistent. I learned tenacity. However unconventional my childhood was, I am grateful for it. It has been a large inspirator for me and a great point of reference in my journey of becoming a physician. 

I have faced many obstacles in my journey. However, one obstacle gave me more trouble than all others. I fell into depression during my undergrad studies. I was met with an opponent I believed to be insurmountable, and my academics suffered for it. My savior came in an unfamiliar form. A small organization called Medical Missions Abroad. I had the opportunity of starting an organization that provided basic medical attention, food, and housing to disadvantaged areas all over the world. Somewhere along the way I had forgotten why I wanted to pursue a career in medicine. My time in this organization refueled my inspirations and while practicing overseas I realized, for the first time in a long time, I was happy. Perhaps the onset of my depression was fear in realizing I may not be able to do what I love most, or rather not be able to realize the intentions I had cultivated for so long. However, a journey is not a journey without hardships and as Bob Ross would say, “we don’t make mistakes, just happy little accidents.” This was my happy little accident. In retrospect, I am thankful this happened to me. I learned much from this experience. I learned about failure, but more importantly, I learned that my desire to become a physician would not be undone so easily.

My journey does not end at or after medical school. My journey’s goal is one of self-fulfillment and medical school is just a means to obtain my true motivator, happiness. To me a physician is an artist, a conductor, a master that guides his own symphony. A calling for which I have a romantic devotion. I had this moment of fulfillment the first time I observed a Neuro-Oncologist perform a tumor resection. Dr. Komotar, Director of Surgical Neuro-Oncology and Fellowship Program. It was a 5-hour long procedure where the patient remained awake. My gaze did not shift, nor did the smile that seemed to be permanently glued on my face. Experiences like that tend to leave lasting impressions. I occasionally reflect on the events I saw that day and I make comparisons with art and music, two other things I’m equally passionate about. I liken it to that of an orchestra with all the individuals representing musical instruments working in tandem to generate one beautiful product. This is why I want to be a physician. I want to be passionate about my craft. I want to excel. I want to continuously challenge myself. Being a physician means more to me than just a job. For me it is an opportunity to exercise my passions and to actualize that dream I cultivated as a child long ago. I am going to be a physician.","To preface, I was not born in the United States. I emigrated from the Dominican Republic at a young age. The term immigrant is often interpreted in a negative way. I argue, being an immigrant gives me a perspective that most people do not have. Adjusting to this country was difficult for my family and I. Culture is at the center of all homes, but what happens when you remove someone‚Äôs culture and place them in an entirely new setting? This is an insight as to what it means to be an immigrant. I consider myself bi-cultured. I identify with the culture of the United States and with that of my birthplace. Having this internal dichotomy gives me an upper hand when it comes to cultural sensitivity. I am not confined by one culture, so in a sense I am aware there are cultural differences and I always do my utmost to show my respect. The lesson to be learned here is that everyone has a unique background, if we can respect that, understanding each other shouldn‚Äôt be so difficult.      ","During my undergrad I had the opportunity of working with an organization called Medical Missions Abroad. As the name suggests, this organization is a student run, student lead, mission trip service that provides food, shelter, clothing, and basic medical attention to communities all over the globe. My work focused primarily on underserved communities in Colombia. I oversaw large groups of students to these rural, underserved communities. The students and I saw, first-hand, how poor living conditions affect the psycho-social determinants of health. In fact, a large part of the individuals we helped were Venezuelan refugees that crossed borders to Colombia.  Although our actions could not make as big an impact as one would hope, I like to believe our work meant something to the individuals living in those communities. The most rewarding aspect of this experience was being able to see the smile on people‚Äôs faces and receiving gratification for our hard work.",,,1,,0,0,1
2023,14573674,,26,Woman,CAN,0,,0,1,"I believe I should be considered an educationally disadvantaged applicant since my secondary education did not have the resources to fully prepare me for college-leveled courses. In regards to the learning environment, many of my STEM courses like Biology and Chemistry did not have rigorous curriculums and there were no labs. More specifically, getting an A in classes that were supposed to be challenging such as AP Biology and AP Physics required only attendance, and it did not matter how poorly you did on exams. This reflected in my grades for my introductory courses and I felt like I was behind everyone else. For instance, I remember my first time in Biology lab where I had to use parafilm on an agar plate. Since it was my first time dealing with laboratory items, I asked my group mates what parafilm was and how to use it. One of my classmates was condescending towards me and asked, ""How do you not know what parafilm is? Haven't you ever done a lab before?"" I had always thought in the back of my head that my peers were ahead of me in the classroom, but this moment truly showed me that my intuition was right.

As I grew older, I questioned if attending weekly mass alone was enough to nurture my spirituality. Despite the plethora of teachings I acquired from the church, one idea stood out to me the most: service. According to Catholicism, to serve God is to carry out one's moral responsibility of meeting the needs of others. Thus, I chose to practice my faith by grounding my connection to religion through action, not just presence. One way I implemented this principle was through church retreats, where I once volunteered at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank with fellow retreatants to package food for underserved populations. This was an enriching experience because I was able to connect and learn from individuals from all walks of life, while ensuring that those in need of food obtain the fuel they deserve. Looking back on that sense of fulfillment, I decided to pursue a career that would allow me to work in a diverse environment and give back to the community.

Making the decision to serve others for a living felt natural, but figuring out the exact way to do so was the challenging part. It was not until eighth grade when I discovered the impact of service through medicine as a patient. At the time, I had a large chalazion bulging underneath my left eyelid that persisted for 6 months. While it was not physically painful, I suffered mentally. Under constant scrutiny and criticism by my peers and even some teachers, my self-esteem began to crumble. Moreover, the lack of knowledge on my affliction made it even more terrifying. Luckily, this changed when I saw a dermatologist.

The doctor educated me on all I needed to know about chalazions and exhibited her prowess in skin anatomy. Until this moment, I had only known science in theory through the context of molecules and chemical reactions. However, hearing the physician go into detail on the anatomy and physiology of my condition triggered my fascination with the human body. It felt extraordinary to encounter biology in a clinical setting where theory was applied practically—knowledge was no longer confined to textbooks—it had the power to actually change a life. Moreover, my dermatologist also demonstrated a great deal of compassion by listening to my story, and it was comforting to know that she saw me as a human being with feelings, not just another medical chart. After my surgery, she guided me in understanding preventative measures so that this ordeal would not repeat again. Through her, I healed both physically and emotionally as I became an active participant in my own health. The impact she made in my life as my physician was unforgettable, and I realized that I wanted to serve others the same way she served me. Ironically, my chalazion that I hated became something to be grateful for: the catalyst in my drive towards medicine.

Following this event, I aimed for opportunities that would grant me a deeper view on the close-knit interaction between science and medicine, and how this interaction influences positive patient outcomes. My experience as an ophthalmic technician was extremely significant because it solidified my desire in becoming a doctor. By testing visual acuity, conducting fundus photography, and performing scans, I worked alongside ophthalmologists to supply the tools needed to monitor the progression of glaucoma. Through my work, I became inspired when I felt how rewarding it was to apply what I learned in school and change people's lives for the better. I vividly remember the long, tiring nights I spent on a glaucoma case study report in a Pharmacology course where I learned about its pathophysiology. This made it a lot more comfortable for me to not only practice diagnostic analysis as a technician, but also act as an educator to patients who were curious about their eyes at the biological level. One patient that comes to mind is Hilary, an 18 year old who had recently been diagnosed with glaucoma. By being afflicted with the disease at such a young age, it was no surprise that something as simple as an OCT scan would make her anxious. As a technician, it was my duty to alleviate her worries by providing thorough explanations on the purpose of the tests we conduct, and how they are vital in monitoring her condition. Without my knowledge of the disease that I acquired from school, I would not have been able to properly educate her on glaucoma and its relationship with the OCT, and she likely would have remained nervous for future visits. Thus, it was extremely gratifying to see that my words induced a change in her attitude as she started to become more confident due to an improved patient care experience. In this way, I have come full circle during my time as an ophthalmic technician: I used my education to help patients become active participants in their own health, just like how my dermatologist did for me.

Ultimately, those in need often find solace through faith or science. However, I have found mine at the intersection of these crossroads, where I choose to feed my spirituality by serving others through the lens of medicine.","As a volunteer at the Filipino American Mental Health Resource Center, I aided in the effort to destigmatize mental health in the community of the Inland Empire. I participated in workshops that focused on various mental health disorders and even created my own event that educated the audience on anxiety. Despite the fact that the resource center's target population was the Filipino community, we welcomed every individual from any background that needed assistance. Having said that, I realized that mental health conditions are a one-size-fits all: they affect anyone regardless of age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status. By interacting with individuals that come from differing backgrounds, I discovered that various factors such as socioeconomical, cultural, societal, and gender norms play a big part in the development of these conditions. Consequently, I gained a more comprehensive understanding of those unlike me, and it felt natural communicating with a diverse group of people.","At UCR, I was a member of the Nutrition Committee at a club called Mini Medical School. During my time there, I collaborated with other students to educate the community on nutrition and leading healthier lifestyles. At school and health fairs, I conducted presentations and engaged in conversations with individuals on how they can take better care of their wellbeing. Not only did we teach the audience how to read nutrition labels, but we also offered brochures detailing cheap, easy, and nutritious recipes that people could use. I recall speaking with one individual who was struggling with being overweight, and as someone who used to be overweight herself, it was easy for me to empathize with them. By listening to their story and providing support, I instilled confidence in them as their attitude towards nutrition improved. It felt rewarding to assist others as they became active participants in their own health because I knew I was making a meaningful impact in their lives.",,,1,"I was still in the middle of spring semester during the first year of my post-baccalaureate program when the pandemic hit, and initially it was a lot harder to excel in my academics because of the online format. The lack of presence in a classroom where I could directly interact with my peers and professors made it harder for me to understand the material. To adapt, I experimented with new ways of learning and discovered new methods of studying I would not have tried if not for virtual learning. Moreover, COVID-19 also affected me in a professional aspect. I chose to not engage in clinical opportunities during my first two semesters at SFSU until I became acclimated to my new program. Thus during spring semester, I needed to gain more clinical experience to enhance my application. Unfortunately, opportunities were scarce and it took me nearly ten months to find a job starting the spring of 2020. Thankfully, I stumbled upon an ophthalmic technician position and started in January 2021.",1,1,1

I enjoyed discovering new barbet nests, catching crabs in streams, and smelling the fresh scent of wet earth mixed with the unique sulfuric odor of the nearby hot springs. As I grew older, I began caring for some of my animal friends - from baby squirrels who fell from their nests to a falcon who injured its wings - I nurtured the animals back to health and released them home. My connection to these animals initially left me dreaming of becoming a veterinarian; however, my plan shifted when I took an EMT course out of curiosity before my sophomore year in college.

I fell in love with human medicine during a shadowing EMT shift, when I followed two paramedics escorting a lady, “Jane”, from a beachside restaurant to the ER. She was pale and clammy, curled up on a bench, moaning loudly due to sudden intense abdominal pain. As I watched the paramedics transfer her onto the stretcher and into the ambulance, I felt a surge of helplessness that I could not do anything to alleviate her pain. The ten-minute ambulance ride felt like an eternity. I tried my best to attend to Jane, gently patting away her cold sweat and covering her with blankets. I encouraged her with words and held tightly to her hand, hoping to somehow transfer some of my energy to her. Finally, we arrived at the ER and got her the medical care she needed. Right before I left her bedside, I felt a light squeeze on my hand and turned to see Jane giving me a small grin. She mouthed a quiet, “thank you”, and through her eyes, I saw her pain gradually fading away. It was this humanistic side of medicine that drew me toward the field - that I was able to sympathize and connect with people in a way that I cannot do with my animal friends.

My passion and understanding for human medicine continued to grow as I began working as a full-time clinical research coordinator. As a coordinator for large kidney transplant clinical trials, I print my patients’ lab reports and mark abnormal values with yellow highlighter weekly for principal investigators to assess. Oftentimes, I notice and feel excited for my patients with less and less highlights on their lab reports as they progress deeper into our studies. Each change in the lab reports signifies the power of medicine and science, which translate directly into our patients’ everyday lives. During the clinic, “Richard”, an older gentleman, shared how ecstatic he was that he was finally off dialysis after transplant and could travel out of state to visit his family. “Estrella”, a young energetic mom, shared that she was finally able to take her kids to Disneyland and did not have to worry about taking mountains of pills daily thanks to our alternative study infusions. With the combination of medical care and clinical trials, our patients were relieved from their chronic pain and regained their quality of life. I learned that medicine is not only about fixing what went wrong, but also about making our patients feel human again. Knowing our study team was able to make positive changes in our patients’ lives, I feel the same joy and fulfillment as the times when I released my animal friends back into nature each time I wave a patient goodbye from completing their last research visit.

Outside of my work hours, I continue to learn about human medicine. On a Saturday night, “Alex”, my youngest patient who had just come into the clinic for his infusion, suddenly texted me stating he was experiencing high blood pressure and was very anxious about what to do. I immediately contacted Dr. S, and she responded right away that she would reach out to him. A few minutes later, she updated me that she had instructed Alex to take some Metoprolol and comforted him that he was not in danger. Hearing Dr. S’s words of reassurance, I let out a sigh of relief and thought about the stress, or even fear, that Alex must have gone through. It was at this moment that I again experienced the uniqueness of human medicine, that doctors not only provide medical support, but just as importantly, serve as patients’ emotional anchors. Alex did not have a medical emergency that night, but the comfort he received from Dr. S healed his mind and heart. As a third party who often experiences small but sure interactions like the one between Alex and Dr. S, I was also healed repeatedly and reaffirmed in my decision to pursue human medicine.

Reflecting on my experiences, I am certain human medicine is my vocation. As an EMT, after taking patients like Jane to the ER, I was left wondering about their conditions and yearned to be a part of the team continuing to provide them care. As a clinical research coordinator, I was blessed to accompany patients like Alex on their recovery journeys; however, I am also driven to work harder to be able to provide them first-hand care and support like Dr. S. Back on the Yang-Ming mountain, my love for my childhood friends led me to care for them when they most needed it. Now with more experience, I am eager to use this same passion to care for the patients I have built such close relationships with over the years.","Growing up, I was never a concertgoer or a party person. Therefore, when I obtained my EMT certification, I volunteered with RockMed to expand my worldview. Through the organization, I staffed concerts, festivals, and sports game venues around the San Francisco Bay Area. Here, I met people from various backgrounds and learned about lifestyles that greatly deviated from my own. From interacting with patients from all age groups, around the country, and of all socioeconomic backgrounds, I strengthened my belief that healthcare access is a human right instead of a privilege. I also realized that equitable healthcare requires more than compassion. It requires tangible action to let patients understand that they always deserve the best quality care regardless of their background. Therefore, when patients refuse our care due to financial or legal concerns, I would always ease their concerns and proudly inform them that RockMed provides free, non-judgmental care.","As a clinical research coordinator, I work closely with study patients in scheduling their clinical trial appointments. Since our hospital is one of Northern California's largest kidney transplant centers, many patients travel far from their homes to receive care. One of my patients, ‚ÄúJake,‚Äù had to drive a 3-hour round trip monthly for his 30-minute research visits, and I noticed Jake looking more tired each time I met him. After learning he worked three part-time jobs, I advocated for his well-being to the principal investigator. Instead of having Jake come in for research monthly, I pushed for establishing home visit services. For visits he had to complete in our hospital, I asked for additional car mileage reimbursements to balance the inflated gas prices. With more personalized care and financial support, Jake expressed great satisfaction in participating in our study; this motivated me to continue looking out for other patients in the same way I supported Jake through his journey.",,,1,I am fortunate that the COVID-19 pandemic did not disrupt my work or financial situation.,0,0,0

My goals are to increase access to quality medical care for all communities, regardless of socioeconomic status. The gravity of astute diagnosis and procedural intervention was revealed to me when my baby brother was diagnosed with congenital hydrocephalus by a brilliant pediatric neurologist when others could not explain his symptoms. My family’s platinum insurance gave us access to her compassionate, expert care as she rushed my brother into surgery to save his life. Since witnessing her lifesaving and proficient intervention on my brother, I have been inspired to pursue a similar path to be able to perform such procedures. The connections I have made with providers and patients have solidified my determination to advocate for healthcare rights. I dream of channeling my passions toward opening a reproductive health clinic, dedicated to supporting the health of all families through quality care and education.

The community health field and its commitment to promoting equitable healthcare access motivate me to become a doctor. After graduating from college, I joined Chicago’s National Health Corps to serve a federally-qualified health center (FQHC) to engage with my community while acquainting myself with the daily responsibilities of a healthcare professional. Working in health education for public schools and as a Medicaid insurance navigator connected me with the healthcare disparities I only knew through the classroom. I bore witness to patients who, without FQHCs, would be denied preventative healthcare and unable to pursue medical treatment because of social or financial constraints. As I bonded with immigrant patients afraid to apply for health insurance for fear of being deported and high school students without consistent access to a primary care provider, I grew a profound responsibility to dismantle healthcare inequalities. When school clinics closed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I created educational video content for my students about preventive health practices while screening patients’ social determinants of health to provide them with supportive resources. In my current position as a pediatric scribe, I am learning how private practice can aid in facilitating equitable care as I work with the leading physician to produce affordable treatment plans based on a patient’s insurance status. I aspire to one day form my own clinic committed to giving affordable reproductive healthcare because I believe prioritizing reproductive health can foundationally uplift disadvantaged populations for generations.

I continued the path towards my goal by obtaining an M.S. in medical physiology with a 4.0 GPA because I enjoy the pursuit of new medical knowledge and how treatment plans are developed based on various diagnoses. By directing my enthusiasm for learning toward discovery, I have initiated a research project with my graduate school’s hematology department to investigate West African natural medicines for sickle cell anemia. From this opportunity, I have been able to critically engage with complex concepts to form a comprehensive research model, solidifying my interest to conduct clinical research alongside my education. I am confident my fascination with medical science will drive my success in medical school.

My passion for medicine began with my little brother and evolved into a movement to advance healthcare equity. Healthcare is a human right I plan to protect, especially for communities with low access to quality, compassionate medical care. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed societal gaps in health education and increased governance impacting reproductive healthcare access has worsened healthcare disparities, promoting distrust in the medical field. My vision for the future is to prioritize individualized care and education for each patient, no matter their background. I want to engage with communities through proficient medical care, as well as increase exposure to trusted medical professionals outside of the clinic by using advancing social media platforms and hosting neighborhood town halls to answer general healthcare inquiries. As an African-American woman from the southside of Chicago, I want to become a doctor to help patients find the treatment they need to protect their well-being and inspire young minorities to add their voices to the health field. Medicine needs providers that reflect the communities they serve and are willing to use their expertise to remove healthcare inequities plaguing patient populations. I choose to become a physician because I know the medical field can elevate families, communities, and our social well-being. I welcome the challenges to come and am excited for the opportunity to work with brilliant physicians to make a better future.","My grandfather‚Äôs colon cancer diagnosis exposed our conflicting perspectives about western medicine. My grandpa refuses traditional cancer treatments and proceeds with naturopathic methods through nutrition because he distrusts the medical field. My bias toward medication and surgery left me unable to accept his approach as an effective plan to save his life. Consequently, our relationship became strained as I could not give my grandpa the unconditional support he has always given me. _x000D_
_x000D_
I have learned that providing support means meeting someone where they are without judgment. When I opened my mind to understanding my grandfather‚Äôs convictions, he opened up to me about the nutritional research he‚Äôs done and the reactions he‚Äôs received from oncologists surprised by the effectiveness of his approach. As a physician, I will give care to patients with different views than my own and it is my responsibility to ensure bias does not detract from the quality of support they receive from me.","While serving as a health educator, I was the nutrition counselor for one student, Diego, who changed my perspective on how I can impact communities. Diego sought to lose 15 pounds ahead of his wrestling season and informed me that his previous approaches were to starve himself. When I educated him about the benefits of eating consistent, nutritious meals throughout the day, he opened up to me about his family‚Äôs food insecurities._x000D_
_x000D_
This admission inspired me to create a resource list of food pantries near his home, food stamp application guidelines, and low-cost, healthy recipes he could share with his family. This taught Diego feasible nutrition methods to meet his goals while indirectly improving the nutrition of his family and friends with similar limitations. From this experience, I learned that providing one person with quality healthcare has enough impact to benefit the health outcomes of entire communities. ",,,1,"My family is lucky to have not suffered severe infections or loss due to COVID-19. However, the pandemic shifted my attention toward the need for greater social justice work in medicine. This crisis exposed us all to the extensive healthcare disparities that exist as barriers to care for low-income, minority patients. These populations have disproportionately high rates of chronic disease, leading to more severe or fatal coronavirus infections. This trend then furthers mounting distrust toward the medical field. _x000D_
_x000D_
The COVID-19 pandemic has taught me that becoming a doctor means more than taking history, performing an exam, and prescribing treatment. I want to be a part of the next generation of physicians who are committed to advocating for patient rights and upholding equitable care. I am inspired to expose patients to different treatments within their means while adding my voice to conversations centered around intertwining social justice with healthcare.",1,1,1

The squad and I were eating breakfast when sirens echoed throughout the station. I remember seeing how the atmosphere instantly changed as everyone rushed to their respective vehicles, already knowing the tasks for which they were responsible. We arrived on scene to a patient sitting in the car holding their face with a star-shaped crack on the windshield. We opened the door and assessed her as we carefully prepared to relocate her to a stretcher while stabilizing her head and neck. It was this event that made me realize the unique cross-section that takes place within the world of medicine. Medical knowledge, empathy, urgency, communication, and the human element seemed to converge in the back of an ambulance. Looking back on this day and my experiences since then, I feel gratitude for my decision to change my career path and explore additional avenues of interest that helped me grow internally and change my perspective about myself, finding what it is I love.

When I think about the lessons learned during this journey, two of the most important ones in my experience are choosing your own path and not letting a single characteristic define you. Although there are circumstances outside of your control, many obstacles to the goals you want to reach, standing by your decisions and being multifaceted allow you to not only learn the most about yourself, but also connect with many aspects of life you would otherwise not have. 

For many years up until my first fall semester at NKU, I had only seen myself as a soccer player. I had been playing my entire life up to this point but began to wonder if this path was something I truly desired. I loved the sport and had been afforded great memories of it through the years. However, I had to truly ask myself who I honestly was and what were the things that genuinely defined me. During that first semester, I experienced hardships dealing with a coach who was verbally and physically abusive towards other players and myself on a regular basis. Having my major outlet feel like the root of my stress, while also being the primary means of affording college, led to a sense of feeling trapped and a profound sense of dissonance. The effect of this experience had manifested itself in parts of my personal life, grades, and relationships. However, it also served as the initial catalyst to begin redefining myself.

As time passed and after transferring to another school, I truly began to take the needed steps to find myself and heal after my experiences. However, it was not until the end of my junior year that I truly decided on what path to choose. I knew from where I stood the road would be long and difficult. However, I still began with minor changes in my philosophy surrounding academics and work ethic. The change in results was not instantaneous, but over many years allowed me to completely overhaul what I was capable of and what I could accomplish. 

After graduating from college, I began working for the military, with my main goal being a slow transition to the medical field. This slow transition involved several steps: 1) saving enough money to get my EMT license and 2) registering for post-baccalaureate advanced biology classes. Additionally, it was during this time that I had learned the most about my limits, as going back to school full-time while working full time during the pandemic was genuinely challenging. However, there are two sides to every coin, and the pandemic, while challenging, did offer an opportunity to attend multiple schools while managing my daily workflow. I am incredibly grateful for this experience, as this was my last step before entering the medical workforce. 

This path has opened avenues within me that I never knew existed. Interacting with so many people from different occupations pushes me to find the place in the community that is most in line with my experiences. Everything has a connection, experiences of different people allow us to further relate to each other, and medical school is the next step in allowing the experience of myself and others to influence people both inside and outside of medical settings. I have viewed each step of this process as a means to an end. I feel that becoming a physician will allow me the tools and perspective to not only further grow as a person, but also to impact people in a way that goes beyond what I may know clinically. I understand that the road is long, challenging, and demanding. However, I also have realized that deciding for myself what is most important to me and walking a path that both acknowledges the many facets and what I have gone through can still bring me joy that I can spread to others.","One experience that has truly helped to open and change my worldview is Crisis Text Line. When going through the training phase, the principal points discussed are bias and perspective. We must be cautious of these aspects of our behaviors, as serving others requires you to leave them behind.   _x000D_
_x000D_
As a counselor, you quickly learn that your viewpoint is limited. You never truly know the obstacles a person faces, or what experiences may be influencing their decisions. Additionally, you may encounter persons you surmise are the antithesis of your own beliefs. Even still, you must understand that this is merely a lens you must remove. I view this as critically important, as this teaches you multiple ways of understanding views outside your own. Furthermore, removing your lens leads to expressing genuine empathy. Over my time serving, I have realized that this point of empathy is the start of helping people through crisis. ","When working as a nursing assistant, there are times when we are tasked with observing patients with suicidal ideation. On one particular night shift, we admitted a man experiencing this following an attempted overdose. I have always been open to listening to patients I care for, as I often enjoy learning about their backgrounds. However, I seemed to have profoundly impacted the man I cared for this particular night. It started with normal conversation and introductions, but as time passed, we began to talk deeply about music, home life, traveling, his time in the military, and much more.   _x000D_
_x000D_
The conversation lasted for many hours, and felt incredibly open and honest. I learned that he was a very thoughtful, kind, and resilient man, and as time passed, he became warmer and more cheerful. By the night's end, he shook my hand, thanked me for how kind I was to his story and situation, and even wrote a letter expressing how this connection changed his outlook. ",,,1,"The covid pandemic created a peculiar environment given my situation. At this point in time, I understood applying to medical school would require returning to undergraduate courses. However, the courses I needed to take were not always offered locally. Furthermore, having a full-time job did not permit flexibility in my schedule required to attend physical classes.   _x000D_
_x000D_
However, many institutions converted learning to an online format as the pandemic peaked. This ended up being critical for me, as my place of work also made this change. This permitted me to be more effective with my time, as my physical presence was no longer required. This allowed completion of both work and school to become possible. By compressing my work tasks to be done as early as possible, I could attend the zoom lectures and tests later in the day. Additionally, remote learning enabled me to attend schools at a distance, allowing me to find classes I needed for applying.",1,0,3
2023,14690046,,29,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"Throughout my childhood, both of my parents faced serious drug addictions, and neither held a steady job. My mom is emotionally unstable and was imprisoned, while my dad still lives in his mother’s garage. There was no money for healthcare or food, so I worked nights and weekends to support my family. I became a parent to my little sister and made sure she had clean clothes, dinner on the table, homework finished, and a ride to school. After years of physical and emotional abuse, we were removed by Child Protective Services. Growing up in a chaotic household, I struggled to get support with my classwork and never discussed basic topics for standardized exams. Despite this, school was my safe zone. In high school, a mentor helped me apply to university. My mom dropped out of college after one term, and my dad never finished high school, so I had little guidance in applying. Seeking a new beginning, I gained admission to UC Santa Cruz with full-ride scholarships, while working up to three part-time jobs.

I scheduled the appointment on my own because in my family, if something was wrong, you either toughed it out, or if it was an emergency, you went to the ER. Forced to grow up fast, through emotional and physical abuse, visiting clinics with my parents by my side wasn’t an option. Without insurance, I had no other way to access healthcare. Sitting on the waxy paper, feet dangling from the exam table, I told the doctor my concerns. For once in my life, I felt heard and seen by someone who listened and cared about me. That was when I knew I wanted to become a doctor, to make others feel as safe and heard as I did in that moment. 

During my last year of college, I had that opportunity as a medical scribe. Although the county hospital was an hour away from home, I sought work there to serve a diverse population. There were mental health patients, trauma victims, uninsured fieldworkers, and prison inmates seeking care in an overwhelmed ER. As their first point of contact, I recorded their medical histories. Some patients were in crisis mode while others were too ill to talk. Often, I was the only one in the room who spoke Spanish. I knew what it was like to be confused and afraid in unfamiliar surroundings. Growing up with parents who battled addiction, I’d spent most of my childhood managing difficult situations. I learned to read the energy of a room from an early age, which prepared me for a lifelong career of working in unpredictable environments. 

Exhausted from working overnight, I was jolted awake by the loudspeakers in the windowless and bone-chilling cold of the emergency room announcing a code blue. A young woman had been found alone and unresponsive at the door of the ambulance bay. She was mottled gray and blue across her pale skin, foaming from her lips, with track marks lining her arms. Hands covered her body as the paramedics pushed the gurney. Despite endless cycles of CPR, there was nothing left to do. As difficult as this was, I listened intently to the doctors calling out physical findings to record every detail. For the first time, I felt the heaviness of losing a patient. Although I know I can’t save everyone that I will care for as a provider, I still hope for the opportunity to try.

Two years later, listening skills helped me connect with others in a vastly different environment. As a Peace Corps volunteer in Peru, one way I helped people was by completely immersing myself in their culture and beliefs. Just days after I’d arrived, I awoke to the sound of tears and panic in my host mother’s voice - her mother, Abuelita, had died of a heart attack. She asked me to join her to cleanse Abuelita’s spirit using the traditional Peruvian holistic medicine of the Sierras. Slowly we picked up the large green hierba santa leaves, soaking in water next to the bed, to sweep them over her cold rigid body. Though I had seen death previously, at that moment, I needed to listen with my heart and mind to understand how to connect to my host family in an entirely new way.

Every encounter as a health volunteer in the Peace Corps was an opportunity to learn and to establish the confianza (trust) that people in the community needed to feel before I could step in to help. Under the blistering sun, Dr. Don Roberto, Nurse Maria, and I walked along uneven dirt roads to meet our first patients of the day. In a two-room adobe home without running water or electricity and surrounded by a yard with a handful of chickens and cuys (guinea pigs), I spoke with a young pregnant mother and her six-year-old daughter. Because I was the only foreigner in the village, none of the topics were easy to discuss: Family planning in a Catholic country. Nutrition in the face of poverty. Hygiene with no access to clean water or sewer lines. Only by listening empathetically to her concerns could I begin to bridge that gap in health education. I heard her sigh of relief and sensed that she felt the way I did at my first encounter with that caring doctor who deeply impacted my life and career path. Standing in this family’s home, I realized how much an environment could impact a patient’s access to healthcare, and ultimately, their own health.

From urban hospitals to rural villages, these diverse experiences have rooted me again and again in my journey to become the compassionate doctor I aspire to be. Growing up in an unstable household, I know the feeling of being uninsured, lost and afraid in a bewildering medical environment. I know how it feels to be vulnerable in a place where no one speaks my native language. As a result, I can now relate to the medically-underserved patients I will serve as a bilingual, Spanish-speaking primary care doctor. By constantly learning the differences among customs, cultures, and languages, I hope not just to care for my patients, but to care about them as individuals. If I truly understand them and their stories, we can work together for better health outcomes even in difficult and uncertain circumstances. I can’t always meet families in their homes as I did in Peru, but I can help them navigate our complex healthcare system by listening, caring, and connecting - one patient at a time.","Coming from American suburbia, I found myself in a rural village in Peru for my Peace Corps service. Serving a community vastly different from my own, there were values and traditions I had to understand before I was effective as a health volunteer. With hospitals more than an hour away, and no money to pay for medical treatments, families used natural remedies to sustain their well-being. In Peru, food is medicine, and ‚ÄúPachamama‚Äù, Mother Earth, heals the community. During home health visits, I learned how to collaborate with families to create patient-centered care plans based on local resources. This level of communication taught me the importance of developing trust with patients. As a doctor, I will connect with people from diverse cultures, who speak different languages, and with backgrounds different from my own. Much like the emphasis on community-based medicine in Peru, I hope to recreate these inclusive healthcare practices in my own clinical practice at Rush Medical College.","At Santa Cruz AIDS Project (SCAP) I worked directly with at-risk populations through field outreach, educational presentations, and community health projects. On outreach missions, I lead Naloxone trainings while handing out hygiene and safer sex packets in unhoused communities. Monthly, I facilitated educational presentations in rehabilitation centers where I identified knowledge gaps and connected attendees with resources to make safer decisions in high-risk activities. To promote sexual health education, I lead a condom dispenser project and distributed more than 20,000 condoms. By connecting with many vulnerable populations, I gained insight into how stigma and shame around HIV/AIDs, sexual health, and drug use resulted in misinformation and discrimination. These experiences taught me how to make meaningful impact within a population through community-based interventions while advocating for underserved populations in a non-judgmental environment. ",,,1,"I was forced to evacuate and leave behind my host family, my village, and my project in Peru where I was serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in March, 2020.

I am confident that my resiliency through the pandemic has prepared me to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor at Rush University.",1,0,3
2023,14694878,,27,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"Having been raised by a single mother of four, economic hardship was our greatest adversary. Our family required government assistance programs such as WIC and SNAP benefits to help with food. Although we had assistance, coming from a low-income household often required everyone to work to help pay bills or school fees. Personally, I view these adversities as character-building experiences, but they also bring about academic difficulties. I had to split my focus between working to pay for my college tuition and my studies. I strongly believe I would have attained a higher GPA if I were solely focused on my education. Similarly, due to financial struggles, purchasing preparatory courses for standardized tests or private tutors was not an option. 

From a different perspective, having an immigrant father that spoke mainly Spanish and a mother who only attained her GED, I was considered a first-generation Latino student. While given this title is a great achievement, navigating these unfamiliar waters as a premed student was challenging and often lonely. Though I had to pave my own path, I thankfully established my own social support system. Grateful to my peers, professors, and employers that have provided me with guidance, I was not alone when overcoming these obstacles.",R,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,8612,3700.0,250.0,,4320.0,120.0,1,250,1,4690,05/15/2021,Concordia University Chicago,Biology; Chemistry,0,,Yes,No,Yes,"$25,000 - 49,999",5,1,1,1,50.0,22.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,9,Adequate,2,2023,2,1.0,1.0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,"After coming inside the house having spent several hours in the relentless summer heat changing my car’s brakes, a typical Sunday turned into one of the most surreal moments of my life. A 500-pound water heater fell on my brother resulting in a deep 7-inch-long laceration to his forearm that severed a tendon. As most would expect, my little brother gripped the wound as blood started dripping profusely and began to run out of the house saying “we need to head to the hospital now.” Scared, my mother began to cry and yell “he could lose his hand” which naturally ensued chaos for everyone in the house. Amongst this commotion, disregarding my own hysteria, I found myself administering first aid by using a clean towel to apply pressure to his wound. With my hand squeezing his muscle back into his arm while raising it above his head, I encouraged my chaotic family to quiet down and grab a lawn chair so I can elevate his feet. Handing off the applying pressure responsibility to his girlfriend, I then took off my shirt and used it as a tourniquet to slow the blood flow to his arm. Grateful for my sister always being on her phone, the ambulance was already on its way and I sat there holding my brother's arm while comforting him. 

Reminiscing about myself sitting in the doctor's office as a child, I remember listening to my mom describe when Dr. Devas saved my sister's life when she had a seizure and stopped breathing. It was the first time I realized physicians do more than routine check-ups. All I could think about is how this person with a stethoscope on my chest was able to handle that situation. When my little brother confided in me after his surgery about how grateful he was to have me there for his accident, I realized I had been developing those same courageous, knowledgeable, and leadership attributes I had idolized in Dr. Devas throughout my premed journey. 

As important as it may be to handle an emergent situation, it is just as vital to be able to display that empathetic perspective that is fundamental to holistic medicine. As a caretaker for my grandpa during his end stage of Parkinson’s Disease, I witnessed firsthand the difficulty of seeing a loved one slowly perish with each new day. However, there is a bit of beauty in every situation. Fortunately for my case, I was able to spend every day with my grandpa for the last few years of his life. Spending time with and caring for him was when I first began to learn about medicine and understand how life-threatening conditions affect people. As one of his caretakers, I reflected on many aspects pertaining to his healthcare plan. As I organized his medications, I would contemplate if prescribing L-Dopa is the best treatment available for this condition. And if there are better treatments, is it a matter of money? After witnessing the impact this condition had on my family, I questioned how a person can help those affected, including family, cope with a disease so devastating. Intrigued by the medicine and curiosity that surrounded my grandpa’s condition, I was motivated to obtain more education and clinical experience which has ultimately strengthened my resolve for becoming a physician. 

After my grandfather passed away and I graduated high school, I had the opportunity to work for several employers that provided a better glimpse into medicine. Working in these professions, I discovered that I sincerely have a passion for caring for patients and not just an interest in learning medicine. My most influential experience was working as a CNA in a dementia unit. Similar to caring for my grandpa, I helped people with dementia-related conditions live a more comfortable life. Although the title of a CNA implies several job responsibilities such as charting daily intake or walking patients, my idea of providing care embodies aspects that were not a part of the job description. I would often work another eight hours after my first shift because of a call-off, just to ensure the residents were not being neglected due to low staffing. Other times I would come in for a few hours on my day off because Trudy was combative, didn't realize where she was and refused to come out of her room for anyone besides her husband. I never did say I was her husband, but she never once refused to have a cup of coffee with me. 

I wholeheartedly believe the world is in need of physicians who not only understand the medical concepts but also the situation, and embody the attributes to properly handle them. As displayed in my brother’s accident, having a first responder skill set to deal with an emergency will most certainly benefit a physician during their career. But just as vital, a physician needs to be able to display an empathetic and caring hand in those situations that seem almost impossible to provide tangible help. Through my clinical, personal, and educational experiences, I have come to understand that the path toward becoming a physician is everything but straight and requires true grit. That being said, having the opportunity to hone these attributes throughout my experiences and possibly develop them through medical training is the essence of what I believe would make me an excellent physician.","One experience that has improved my understanding of individuals who come from different backgrounds would be working alongside graduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Ranked 5th out of 1,000 for overall most popular U.S. universities for international students, many of my friends that I have made during my employment come from another country. With the amount of time that I have spent learning about their culture, I have also learned about the struggles they encounter in America. Amongst these struggles, the most common concern is how to comprehend the intricacies of the U.S. healthcare system. Listening to the negative interactions that they have experienced has displayed the importance of alleviating obstacles, such as the complexities of healthcare coverage, so that we may strive to improve health equity for all people regardless of their background.","Leaving rural Illinois to attend college in the Chicagoland area taught me there were differences in health disparities between urban and rural communities. Despite these differences, I have noticed that both of these communities struggle with outreach and educating people about healthcare-related resources. I was fortunate enough to have firsthand experience with outreach when I volunteered as a Pandemic Health Navigator. In this position, I helped patients that were quarantined understand the funded resources that could be provided to them, such as assistance with food and medicine. I found this experience to be very fulfilling because I helped many people in my community who were struggling in various aspects as a result of the pandemic. Although my time as a volunteer has allowed me to contribute to the pandemic, this experience helped illustrate the importance of outreach and education as necessary steps toward meeting the healthcare needs of our communities.",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic started I was forced to graduate a few months early with no commencement ceremony. After graduating, my job offer to work as a research technician at Loyola University was retracted and I spent the next  3-4 months unemployed in Chicago using my entire savings to pay for living expenses. In addition, I had planned to retake my MCAT before the application cycle for 2020 started, but all exams were canceled for several months. Given my circumstance, I decided it would be in my best interest to take some time to stabilize my life and potentially strengthen my application. This process started with my relocating to central Illinois, which allowed me to gain new research, volunteer, and personal experiences. Although my path taken toward applying for medical school is untraditional and filled with many challenges, I am fairly grateful for these adversities; it is a beautiful testament to the grit I possess and the resolve I have to become a physician.",1,1,1
2023,14707982,,36,Woman,IND,0,,0,1,"Eleven years ago, I moved from India to obtain a master's degree in the United States. Moving to a new country was very exciting but also very terrifying. Integrating into a new culture came with its own difficulties, including learning English as a second language and experiencing homesickness. I would walk home in embarrassment after asking the waiter to prepare my food to be taken as a ""parcel"" and for them to never understand. I later learned the correct word for my request was ""to-go."" Since then, I have put in conscious efforts to learn the colloquial verbiage by interacting with native English speakers. Additionally, I faced financial and living insecurities due to my lack of a credit history. Paid clinical positions were not allowed because of the absence of a work permit, and this held me back from gaining long-term clinical experience. To gain relevant experience, I started volunteering in research labs and hospitals. Although I was financially disadvantaged through volunteering, I gained valuable experience, great friends, and mentorship. Through my interactions with peers and mentors, I was exposed to several glimpses of a career in medicine.

The family had come to Satya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences (SSIHMS), Bangalore, India, seeking medical care. This hospital provided free medical care to people of low-income status. Despite the commotion, Dr. Gupta entered and easily connected with the parents through gestures, reassuring tones, and interpretation service. He examined Rena, ordered tests, and ensured the family had a better picture of the course of treatment. This episode has stuck with me for the past twenty years because Rena's parents put all their trust in Dr. Gupta, a stranger from a different country speaking a foreign language. As a fourteen-year-old kid working as a 'Sevadal' (volunteer), I realized that medicine is a profession that overcomes all superficial barriers and facilitates two human beings to help each other in vulnerable times.
At the end of my high school education, I was at the crossroads of choosing a major for college. I strongly considered medicine, but I held myself back and steered away from this dream with a self-imposed doubt of not being able to shoulder the immense responsibility of patients' health and, more so, their lives. Nevertheless, I completed the four-year engineering program with distinction, accomplished to get admitted into the University of Maryland, College Park, for my master's degree, and finally secured a full-time job as a mobile communication Engineer. Having cleared my student loans, I was happy that the job gave me financial security. Yet, although the work was important, I still felt incomplete.
I knew I had to take the leap when my friend told me about an opportunity at Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins. With little to no knowledge of Biology, I learned to dissect the eyes and pancreas of mice on day one. As a retina surgeon, my PI encouraged me to go beyond mice studies and understand human physiology. I invested a lot of time learning and gradually realized my heart was always in medicine. While I realized I was at a disadvantage concerning my age, background, and immigration status, I was still determined to make it work this time as I explored various available options.
I shadowed Dr. Tanner, an OB/GYN, to further explore my interest in medicine during a hysterectomy procedure. I not only witnessed Dr. Tanner's expert robotic surgery skills on the 'da Vinci' but also his compassion when he had to deliver sad news to his patients. One encounter that impacted me was when he had to relay to ""Sam"" that further exploration showed a mass on her ovaries. While Dr. Tanner explained the findings, I held her hand and realized what it felt like to be vulnerable. I kept my eyes on hers and softly smiled as I attempted to comfort her. Dr. Tanner consoled Sam and answered all her questions empathetically yet assertively. He explained every treatment option available to her and empowered her to make an educated decision on her next steps. This experience humbled me as I realized an expert skillset is not enough to deliver quality care. The human connection and compassion physicians offer their patients are necessary to uplift them and help them cope with their circumstances. Someday, I hope to experience the honor of earning my patients' trust and healing them of their ailments.
To gain more clinical experience, I started working as a clinical research coordinator (CRC) on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). As a CRC, I was trained on various techniques, including measuring Slow Vital Capacity (SVC). SVC scores depended on multiple factors; I scored low while training, as I grew up in a tropical country with substantial air pollution. ""Sarah,"" one of our new patients, had trouble using the machine as she had bulbar onset of ALS. Looking at her score drop, Sarah did not want to continue the analysis and requested to leave. She said an online forum mentioned a poor prognosis for low SVC results. I shared my SVC experience with her and explained that the scores depend on various factors. Dr. Berry, the study's lead investigator, shared the perils of diagnosing oneself based on partial information found in online forums. All of this gave her some solace, and she decided to stay for further diagnosis. This was an enriching experience as I felt I did my part to improve Sarah's quality of life by empowering her to continue in the research program. As a physician, I hope to help alleviate the added stress of misinformation from online forums.
Stripped down to a hospital gown and in pain, often without a known cause, patients inevitably look to their doctors for guidance when making life-altering decisions. The desire to fulfill this unwritten contract has fueled me through the long days and nights working full-time and completing prerequisites for medical school over the last five years. This drive - to develop myself to serve my patients better - will give me the determination to overcome the challenges presented by medical school and residency. Each morning I wake up resolved to become a reliable, competent doctor worthy of the utmost trust, capable of changing the lives of patients who seek healthcare every day.","Living in Baltimore and East Harlem has opened my eyes to many social disparities. I was in the ER recently due to a vasovagal response. Fortunately, my family is insured. I was shifted to the nearest hospital within ten minutes of placing the 911 call. While I was rushed into the ER, there were several patients, primarily underserved, outside the hospital, waiting to be treated. On another occasion, I saw a man lying on the sidewalk near my home, unresponsive but awake. I waited for a few minutes and called for an ambulance. I was surprised when it took twenty minutes for them to arrive. Having given the benefit of the doubt, I started explaining the situation. They brought the man to consciousness, gave him fluids, and left. I realized that, unlike me, this was the level of treatment he could expect, as he did not have insurance. These experiences have taught me that the underserved are less likely to receive even the most basic medical care, which most of us take for granted.","Volunteering at New York Common Pantry, Manhattan involves distributing meal packages to the socioeconomically disadvantaged population of East Harlem. The ‚ÄòSmiths‚Äô are a regular family I have known fondly. One Sunday, I was talking to them about their daughter‚Äôs exams when Mrs. Smith mentioned that she didn‚Äôt score well on them. She said they had to move to the Bronx as the rent had increased astronomically. Because of the move, their daughter could not prepare well. Their whole life was uprooted, and now they had to look for schools and healthcare providers and form relationship in a new community. In the hope of reducing their stress, I contacted our Bronx-based pantry and enrolled the Smiths there. Like them, most of their friends and family were displaced into other burrows of New York City. Gentrification results in the expulsion of residents, a decline in neighborhood diversity, and a decrease in small businesses.

I made peace with it and decided to work on my greencard application. However, all greencard applications were on hold due to a staff shortage. This came as quite a shock for my family. It meant our stay in the US would soon end, and I would have to give up on medical school. It was all the more challenging to stay positive.

Dickens was writing of the French Revolution. In the case of Iranian politics it was the Green Revolution in 2009.

In 8th grade, in 2009, I decided to use the extra hour on my final exam to write an anti-government poem for a sympathetic literature teacher. Riskily, she posted my poem on a website. Even though it was anonymous, my parents were alarmed – people who wrote such things sometimes disappeared. Moreover, I sometimes skipped school to join the protests and to paint pro-democracy paintings. On June 17th 2009 one of the college students was shot by police.

In 6th grade at the age of ten, I had decided that I’d be the one to find a cure for AIDS. (I had been reading many biographies of scientists.) The only way to set about doing this was to become one of the 120 accepted out of 50,000 applicants to the National Organization for Development of Extraordinary Talents (NODET). In Iran, every school is limited to the government-controlled curriculum. Except for NODET. They were known for offering a strong, independent education to help modernize Iran, teaching critical thinking while trying to stay within the confines of government regulations. Even so, sometimes they would slip.

One of my teachers mentioned in passing that Iran reported inaccurate incidence rates for AIDS; the government was denying the facts about prostitution, drug use and homosexuality. Working with fellow students, I dug into publicly available data-sets of socioeconomic data to identify high-risk groups. The data-sets clarified many correlations otherwise obstructed by the government. For months, I sent daily emails to MAHAK hospital, a non-profit and non-governmental organization to help children who had cancer. The daily e-mails persuaded them to let me contribute to their epidemiological research department despite my not having a high-school diploma. (Iran was decades away from electronic health records.) It fell to me to call families and ask about their child’s post-operative health. Sometimes I had to ask about a child who had recently died.

It was at this time, while my concern with community health was growing, that my parents talked everyday about moving to America. When I was fifteen, we got on a plane.

The Iranian government was denying treatment and preventative care to its people to escape criticism of its policies. Such shortcomings were not unique to Iran, they were common even in the USA. I explored different strategies including artificial intelligence and Blockchain. Without knowing how the results were implemented at the patient level, it felt abstract.

The work at Epic, the well-known, often loathed electronic health record company, started with talking to providers and understanding their workflows. At a company meeting, I learned we could use our dynamic cloud data to predict outcomes. I wanted to support physicians conducting real-world data analysis.

Learning to do this meant gaining the skills and the knowledge to make sense of clinical observations, mine and other people’s, and of population-based correlations. This, while providing clarity and comfort, knowledge and understanding, for patients. I’m one of many immigrants who, in making a new beginning in a country where they did not at first speak the language, are being brought to realize their own hopes and ambitions.

While working with patients in Boston, I saw them cope with the realization that their Parkinson’s symptoms were going to worsen despite receiving every medical and surgical treatment possible. When they would panic, the neurologists with whom I worked transformed from diagnostic specialists to comforting comrades. They listened, calmed, asked patients about their goals, and soberly explained what to expect as their disease worsened. I came to realize the neurologist's ability to care came less from reading about the nervous system than from directly tending to many patients throughout the natural course of disease. Acknowledging the opportunities I’ve had till now - from conducting academic research to working in corporate healthcare - I have good reason to believe that a career that will offer the most intellectual stimulation and emotional satisfaction will be that of a physician.

A physician’s role should perhaps not be siloed to individual patient interactions. There is a larger setting that should be considered. This sentiment is best put to words not by me but by Dickens in a poverty-stricken London setting. A crossing-sweeper in London has died. “Dead! Dead, your Majesty. Dead, my lords and gentlemen. Dead, Right Reverends and Wrong Reverends of every order. Dead, men and women, born with Heavenly compassion in your hearts. And dying thus around us every day.”  Heavenly compassion, as Dickens knew in his campaigning, needs practical compassion in this life. And there is even such a thing as intelligent self-interest. For, as with the COVID pandemic, a death in sickness that was preventable is often infectious and contagious, and “shall work its retribution, through every order of society, up to the proudest of the proud, and to the highest of the high”.","During my free time in Ghana, I took boxing lessons from Dominque, a local Accra boxer._x000D_

At first it was challenging for us to communicate. I spoke American English while he spoke Pidgin English but we found ways to understand each other. I asked him how many siblings he had.

I couldn‚Äôt imagine being in their shoes and though I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit, maybe I judged Dominique, as the only literate member of his family, for spending so much time in church instead of finding ways to provide more for them. He finally invited me to visit his family. Living and breaking coconuts with them for a day made me understand their reality a bit more. _x000D_

2023,14726108,,29,Man,USA,0,,1,1,"As a single immigrant parent, there were few things my mother would not do for us. Often working ten-to-twelve-hour days cleaning houses yet scared to ask for more than what equated to less than minimum wage, many of my mother’s responses were a consequence of the wounds that persisted years after domestic violence and abuse at the hands of my father. Where adult supervision was scarce, my development was nurtured by my older sister and the transient mentors that came into my life. When my brother spiraled into his meth addiction, I remember being afraid I would follow in his footsteps.

But my mother raised us to be brave and to have the audacity to do everything with love. It was these lessons that sustained me when I struggled to keep up with my peers as a first-generation college student and sometimes to even afford to feed myself.

Border patrol agents proceed to brush me aside and handcuff her. As the afternoon dusk of the Arizonan desert turns to night, we are driven to a detention center. At seven years old, I remember wondering where my sister and I would call home as I stammered in prayer.

During my mother’s absence, my definition of family became broad, as my sister and I looked to the support and kindness of friends and strangers alike to get by. My community included many who had come to the U.S. with the hope of finding a better future but who faced a distinct reality in trying to survive—a reality that consisted of seeing friends and family more scared of a hospital bill than the chronic pain they suffered, and of translating for family members in an emergency room at 3 a.m. when no one else could. This fueled my desire to be a physician. I wanted to understand what caused my best friend’s cancer. I wanted all to view a hospital as a sanctuary rather than as a last resort. But most importantly I wanted to provide empathy and understanding when it was most necessary. I left home to become the Doctor my community needed.

It was again seeing people around me struggle to be heard or to be seen that first drew me to the student-run clinic, the Suitcase Clinic, as an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. At times I felt that the hygiene supplies and clothing donations that I offered our clients as Health Education coordinator fell short of the reality many patients faced dealing with homelessness as soon as they walked out of clinic doors. But over the years, I realized that every story I heard, and every friendship I formed with those who came to clinic represented a tie to my community. A deeper understanding and connection that compelled me to make the extra time to help a client after clinic closed or go beyond my expected role to find a resource for patients. It was an effort to ensure that patients knew that if nothing else was consistent, clinic could be a dependable source of hope.

As a Family Services Specialist for the University of California, San Diego, I carried the lessons from my community work forward to support families on what was often their worst day following the passing of a loved one. For some, that meant helping facilitate the process of organ donation to help their loved one give the gift of life, while for others it meant overcoming every hurdle to make sure families could say goodbye to their loved one in person at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. At times working in 24 to 48-hour shifts, I quickly learned that part of being an advocate within healthcare meant going beyond one’s comfort zone to help those in times of crisis begin to heal. It was treating a patient and their family as a whole and being willing to meet families in their grief and anger. Despite differences in culture or language, it was my desire to understand and the humility to know I did not have all the answers that allowed me to connect with families, and where words failed, have my actions reflect my commitment to patients and families alike.  

Time and again, I desired to see in medicine a physician that reflected my community.  Part of my struggle to become a doctor stemmed from a desire to be represented and to belong. That sense of belonging did not come until I had the privilege to be a part of the underrepresented student pathway program, the UCSF Kaiser Permanente Undergraduate Research Internship (URI). Here, for the first time, leadership embodied vulnerability, and the son of a housekeeper could believe he had something to offer medicine. Research came to represent an avenue through which I could bridge my love of learning with my commitment to service. I came to see the discovery and mentorship inherent to research as an avenue to assume leadership and disseminate knowledge to communities that would otherwise not have access. I knew I wanted to someday continue research as a physician so that I might serve as a bridge between my roots and academic medicine, and thereby promote the health of vulnerable communities and the empowerment of diverse scholars. I continued to work toward this goal by returning to the University of California, San Francisco, as an instructor for the URI Leadership Curriculum and as a clinical research coordinator for the Pediatric Surgery Division. Through these experiences of learning and teaching, finding a renewed purpose in working alongside future leaders in healthcare.

I am a culmination of my experiences as the son of immigrants and as a healthcare advocate. I have seen the importance of staying connected to the spaces and people who have helped raise me. I know that part of the fight to respect the autonomy of patients and make healthcare a human right will require advocacy both in and outside of clinic. I adamantly believe those I have had the privilege to grow alongside in my journey toward medicine will be instrumental in seeing the realization of this purpose.  My commitment to someday work as a physician for all, but especially the vulnerable and underserved, emanates from knowing that it has often been these people whom I have called family.","As I sit down with Harvey inside of clinic and begin to bandage his hand, he tells me about the dog that attacked him on the street. Despite my insistence for him to see one of our providers in the clinic, he is reluctant and continues sharing. Unfortunately, his story is not unique. Many who came to the Suitcase Clinic and were unhoused often shared the neglect and violence that came with their day to day. Something I knew little about. But on those days when I came into clinic ready to learn from patients, I was able to earn their trust. As I walked with Harvey to see one of our providers after some convincing, I realized that for many who routinely encountered discrimination in society at large for being unhoused, it might not be enough to be a physician. I had to be someone that they could trust, someone who they had seen week after week in their community. Who I was as a person came before who I was as a physician in meeting a patient's needs.","The fight to address the systemic and structural barriers that compromise the health of our communities is larger than any one individual. But the strength and solidarity I found in pathway programs like the UCSF/Kaiser Permanente Undergraduate Research Internship (URI) demonstrated to me that making a difference started with empowering others. By returning to URI as an instructor and helping elucidate the hidden curriculum behind medicine while mentoring students, my impact was seen in the cohorts of other underrepresented first-generation students that continued their journey into medicine with a renewed sense of direction and hope. By working with this community, students walked away with the support and resources needed to assume leadership roles in service organizations and enter medical school. Gradually I knew that each contribution I made contributed toward my dream of having medicine better reflect the diversity of the communities it seeks to serve.",,,1,"At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, my uncle passed away due to COVID and my sister was admitted to the hospital after developing a pulmonary embolism. My bout with the disease alongside many family members caused me to consider whether medicine was a ‚Äúrealistic prospect‚Äù after months of being unemployed alongside my mother and seeing our financial resources dwindle. This in turn led me to delay some of the steps needed to move forward with improving my application and applying to Medical School. However, against the advice of even some of my family members, I began taking post-baccalaureate coursework at UCSD Extension and volunteering at St. Leo‚Äôs Free Medical Clinic while seeking work. At that point in my journey, I felt I could lose everything. Yet, I chose to focus on the eagerness and love I could only derive from pursuing higher education and working in my community in the hopes of someday entering medical school.",1,0,2
2023,14729456,,28,Woman,USA,1,EO2,0,1,"My parents, who immigrated from Mexico and El Salvador, saw education as the key to success, but getting into college was not the final step in reaching my aspirations. As a first-generation college student, I lacked mentorship in navigating higher education and was lost in accessing the resources needed to succeed at this level. Initially, I managed to keep up with the newfound rigor of my courses while juggling work to support myself. But as time passed, I began to struggle and didn’t know where to turn for help. Raised in a Latino household, where mental health was never acknowledged, this struggle felt like a reflection of my ineptitude as I lived in denial of any issue.
It was not until the end of my junior year that I came to terms with the reality that I needed help and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. With therapy, I overcame my depressive episode and learned coping techniques for my anxiety. As a result, I succeeded in the rigor of my academics, the pressure of being a new high school teacher, and the complexity of graduate school research. My experience also informed my teaching as I supported students struggling with their mental health. Through my challenges, I am grateful to have gained invaluable emotional growth and the confidence to handle any stressors ahead of me.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,108652,735.0,135.0,230.0,,101.0,1,365,1,236,09/12/2020,University of California-Berkeley,Molecular and Cell Biology,0,,Yes,No,Don't Know,"$50,000 - 74,999",5,0,1,0,0.0,50.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21,Exceptional,4,2023,2,5.0,0.5,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,"My family talks about their horrifying accidents and near-death experiences in a nonchalant manner. My father is no exception. Scars run down his legs because scalding oil spilled onto him as a child, severely burning through layers of skin. Since the nearest hospital was two hours away, my grandmother, a self-sufficient mother of 13, took it upon herself to treat his injury by applying melted tire to the wound to kill off any infection. The carefree nature with which my father relayed this contrasted sharply with my horror at hearing a remedy that seemed worse than the injury.
To this day, my Abuelita trusts herself more than any doctor - using VaporRub to treat a swollen ankle or instructing my dad to sleep with onions in his socks when he has the flu. I understood why my grandmother had to use drastic remedies after visiting Mexico and traveling to my dad’s secluded childhood home. The dark, dirt-floored kitchen where he was born hardly seemed like a safe place to go into labor. The disparities in access to health care and my grandmother’s earnest attempts to heal first inspired my curiosity for medicine and desire to help those in underprivileged communities. However, my family’s contradicting attitude of deference and distrust for physicians created a confounding perception of medicine and our healthcare system.
My great-grandmother, Tité, listened intently, nodding as her physician explained her condition. At the end of the explanation, she turned to my grandmother, “Que dice?” Tité sat behind a wall of confusion, unable to understand a word of the prognosis. When her physician was hesitant to perform a life-saving surgery because of Tité’s age, my family’s demeanor quickly turned to skepticism as they whispered doubts about the physician’s rationale. I was perplexed by this sudden shift to distrust, but it was not an unusual reaction for my family. Their experiences unveiled my naivete of idealizing our healthcare system as infallible and echoed a trend of medical distrust felt by minorities. These realizations inspired the hope that, as a physician, I could be a part of shaping the necessary change in our healthcare system.
Seeking to address inequities in education, I joined Teach For America, where I first experienced the weight of responsibility for someone else’s future. After a long day of conferences, our team of ninth-grade teachers was excited to meet with our last family, but the room quickly sobered as we saw the concerned look on Elisa’s face. “I’m doing my best to take care of my grandson,” she said defeatedly, “but I don’t know what else to do.” My chest felt heavy hearing her sincere hopes for his future, but as we made a plan to support him, this weight gave way to purpose.
Every time I walked into my classroom and met 32 pairs of eyes beaming expectantly, I felt the onus to ensure my students’ academic success and address their individual needs. Unfortunately, I found that the latter was not always within my ability. I could not change their home life or quell the frustration of schooling as a new English learner. Rather than be defeated, I used this as motivation to do what I could - providing individual tutoring or a safe space to talk during office hours. Their excitement to learn and increased confidence highlighted the direct impact these actions could make, and I relished my responsibility to my students despite how daunting it initially seemed. However, seeing students fall behind due to chronic health issues or worries for their families' health during the pandemic made it clear that education could not always come first.
Drawn back to medicine, I began shadowing at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where I met Dr. Alice Chung, who embodied the ideal physician I once naively imagined. I listened intently as she patiently guided me through the steps and rationale behind a sentinel node biopsy and lumpectomy - my eyes transfixed on her steady hands, etching through layers of fat to free the tumor. Elated with my newfound grasp of these procedures, I left inspired by the warm learning environment Dr. Chung created and energized by the prospect of carrying my role as an educator into medicine. On my next shift in the clinic, the patient from the OR sat in a pink gown - her ecstatic smile was contagious as she heard about the procedure’s success. Her relief exuded everything I hoped to provide for my patients: the triumph of their fight, the serenity of better health, and the anticipation for their future.
While Abuelita’s home remedies inspired my initial interest in medicine, my community’s distrustful attitude toward our healthcare system transformed it into a drive. The lack of representation in medicine made my goal of becoming a physician seem distant, but it motivates me to push forward in hopes of serving as a mentor for students with backgrounds like my own. While I hope my background creates a comforting space in healthcare for members of my community, it will also inform my practice as I work to improve the position of underserved communities within our healthcare system. Though my care as a physician will look drastically different than my Abuelita’s, I will carry her same passion to each patient I encounter, hopefully, equipped with more than onions and melted tires.","As a teacher, I saw differences in my students‚Äô motivations and learning styles. I quickly realized that it would take much more than simply implementing lesson plans for all my students to find success. I created individualized assignments for my students with disabilities using sentence frames with word banks and bilingual assignments for my English learners, leading to a shift in my students‚Äô confidence. While accommodations were originally unfamiliar to me as a new teacher, it became clear how essential they were for my students‚Äô learning. _x000D_
_x000D_
By acknowledging my students' differences and adapting my curriculum to meet their needs, I created a classroom where everyone could find success. I‚Äôve learned through my students that without embracing diversity, we risk isolating groups and limiting their capacity for growth. As not all systems equitably support the diversity of our population, we must take steps to learn about the inequity that impacts marginalized groups within our society.","In Teach For America, I had the opportunity to work in an underprivileged area where I discovered the most important aspects of being an educator were patience and the flexibility to meet students where they were. One student, David, deflected any serious conversations about his mother‚Äôs absence but stood on tables or walked around during class to cope. I used these moments to talk about what he needed rather than penalize his behavior, building a relationship based on communication. When David moved away, he emailed me, ‚ÄúNo matter what I did the day before, thank you for acting as if nothing happened the next day.‚Äù I was surprised at the impact that seemingly small actions could make, as it felt like a given to reset each day. As a physician, I hope to care for my patients with the same patience and flexibility to create comfort in uncertain times.",,,1,"While teaching at a school with a predominantly Latino population, I saw how my students and their families were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. My students struggled with academics as concerns about the health of their families overwhelmed them. The pandemic was just one example of disparate health outcomes marginalized communities face, but the issue is far more pervasive. These observations pushed me to be a physician that can help improve conditions for communities like mine._x000D_

While looking forward to volunteering in a hospital again after transitioning from being a full-time teacher to a student again, I found it challenging to find volunteer positions, let alone anywhere I could directly assist patients. Thankfully, I found the Pre-Health Volunteer Program through Cedars-Sinai, which allowed me to shadow two physicians for a quarter last fall. As I continue volunteering at Cedars-Sinai, I also hope to find other physicians open to shadowing despite the pandemic.",1,0,3

My uncle had already defied the odds by overcoming cancer, but this did not stop his battle with alcoholism and Bipolar I disorder from manifesting into a life-threatening skull injury that left him disabled for months. He miraculously recovered and returned to living independently, so my family was devastated from his sudden death years later from a completely unexpected cause: a heart attack. I struggled to come to terms with his loss because in my heart I knew his death was due to more than some uncontrollable physiological etiology. I understood my uncle’s death as the culmination of enduring a lifetime of various factors that deteriorated his health ranging from growing up in a culture that did not recognize mental illness as a disease, unhealthy lifestyle choices, and financial barriers that prevented consistent access to healthcare. My memories of my uncle and everything he endured left a deep impression on my understanding of the complexity of health and spurred my desire to pursue medicine to counter the health disparities he faced. 

During my time in college, I was compelled to pursue majors in Anthropology and Psychology and develop outside of the classroom in order to learn about medicine from a holistic, biopsychosocial perspective. I reveled in mentoring a small group of middle school girls in Oakland and helping them develop into leaders for their underserved community. My mentees divulged that many of their peers worried about their next meal, and I was proud to see them transform interventions we brainstormed together into school projects ranging from hosting food drives to making educational posters. My mentees motivated me to become a physician who could not only heal patients, but could also provide the guidance needed to confront major health crises propagated by cycles of intergenerational socioeconomic inequality. As a university health worker, I also offered health-related advising and directed my peers to take advantage of accessible hospital resources. I saw first-hand how breaking down knowledge barriers could alleviate health disparities by trickling down to affect peoples’ health at the level of preventative care. Though I was not always able to address all my peers’ unique health concerns, I discovered showing compassion as a non-judgmental, approachable equal was another crucial aspect of providing care. 

I further deepened my understanding of medicine through working as a surgical assistant at an oral and maxillofacial surgery practice and witnessing the immense responsibilities of a doctor. As I handed instruments and monitored vitals during these high-pressure surgeries, I watched in awe as the surgeon deftly performed his procedures while soothing his patients. It was here that I had the revelation that the beauty of medicine is in its paradox: it is as much an art in responding to the patient’s emotional distress as it is a science in treating their physiological needs. I later jumped at the opportunity to work as a clinical research coordinator for the Stanford Pediatric Oncology Department having experienced the importance of clinical research in providing my dad, a CML patient, with a life-saving targeted therapy drug. I observed oncologists working together with families to make hard decisions concerning the best interest of the patient, how long to pursue treatment options versus prioritizing quality of life, and avenues for making chronic care more accessible. I realized the discipline of medicine appears deceptively black and white when in reality it requires navigating through a sea of grey. I often think of little ten-year old Tim, who had multiply relapsed anaplastic astrocytoma, who came to Stanford to enroll on a phase I trial utilizing electric fields emitted by transducer arrays attached to the scalp to halt mitosis in cancer cells. Though he was clinically improving on trial for a year, his interval MRIs served as a dismal reminder that his disease was still progressing. Despite the terminal nature of his cancer, Tim exuded life whenever his neuro-oncologist or I talked to him about Star Wars or engaged him light-saber battle while pretending to be Darth Vader. His giggles lit up his parents’ eyes, and his mom constantly expressed how grateful they for these valuable moments of joy with their son. It was clear to me that even when a cure is out of grasp that a physician could still be a pillar of solace for their patient. As I move forward on my journey to become a doctor, I envision a future where I can bring a radiant smile to the face of a suffering patient like my Uncle Navin or Tim.

My experiences have shown me many avenues for enhancing the lives of others whether it be through performing a life-altering surgery, serving disadvantaged communities, educating the masses about public health crises, or researching to further innovations in cancer treatments. As long as I am equipped with the armor of medicine, the sky is the limit in terms of how I can care for humanity.","I have always appreciated being able to live and work in environments where I am constantly being stimulated by different cultures, religions, and perspectives. I had one experience when volunteering the hospital where a nurse asked if I could bring a heated blanket to an elderly Chinese woman in pre-op. I could sense how nervous the patient was when I approached her, and I also realized she did not speak English. I did my best to make her feel comfortable, and after I noticed that she had a picture of a dog on her phone screen we bonded through sharing photos of our dogs. When I discharged her after her procedure, the sweet lady shook my hand and had her son thank me for making her feel comfortable when she was feeling scared. Her son told me that she previously avoided going to the hospital because of her inhibitions with the cultural barrier. In the future, I will continue to find ways to connect with patients from diverse backgrounds in ways that will transcend cultural barriers","Even more so through working at Stanford during this COVID-19 pandemic, I have seen the socioeconomic barriers that our patients experience with healthcare access, as many of them live in areas of California that lack health clinics that can provide the specialized care they need. It is hard seeing families struggle to make ends meet to bring their children all the way to Stanford from all over California to receive care, and being exposed to this reality really opened my eyes to the scarcity of physicians. I have been working with the Stanford IRB and the sponsor for my clinical trials to gain approval for my study patients to get the standard of care aspects of their therapy at clinics closer to home. Seeing the challenges presented to our healthcare system during this COVID-19 pandemic and impacting our medically underserved communities has further solidified my desire to pursue medicine to work on finding ways to expand healthcare accessibility for patients of all backgrounds.",,,1,,1,0,1
2023,14757909,,25,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"As a child, my five person family solely relied on my father’s income and federal assisted programs like WIC. Additionally, besides needing to provide for our nuclear family, my immigrant parents provided monthly financial support to relatives living in both Mexico and Él Salvador. In the eighth grade, I began cutting neighbors’ yards and as soon as I turned fifteen, I got a job as a soccer referee, a position I held for the majority of high school. Despite the role money and my parent’s limited educational experience played in my life, I made sure to prioritize participating in educational opportunities that I believed would help me be successful, such as joining the International Baccalaureate program and playing the violin for seven years. I excelled in school academically and socially in spite of the mistakes I originally made; in hindsight, due to not having a traditional support system that most of my classmates seemed to have. Throughout college, I held paying jobs, on top of my other extra curricular activities.

As I stood outside the room, one of the three residents said, “Our patient is a 3 year old boy who needs a radical nephrectomy due to a rare Wilms Tumor.” I walk into the room and see four adults surrounding a small boy hooked up to several IVs, all talking loudly in Spanish. They turned to face us and the room went silent. “Hola, me llamo Hector”, happily said the boy. Dr. James grinned and started explaining the diagnosis and case to the family, using a lot of scientific terminology. I scanned the room and saw the family members’ faces go blank.

            “¿Usted qué piensa?” asked Hector’s mom. I glanced to my sides at the medical staff to see how they would respond. After a long pause, I realized that she was asking for my thoughts. I felt my hands get clammy and the blood rush to my face. All I could think about was that I was only 19 years old and this was my first time stepping into the shoes of a physician, rather than being in the familiar role of a patient. Three days prior, I arrived at Duke University to start the Summer Biomedical Sciences Institute, a pre-health program for underrepresented minorities. “What was I doing here?”, I asked myself.  I did not know anything about pediatric renal tumors and I thought I could not give her the answers she was looking for. 

          “¿Hola muchacho, usted qué piensa?” Hector's mother asked me again intently, with more pressure. I wanted to say “No sé”, until I observed the desperate expressions on the family members’ faces. I looked at Hector’s mom and all I could see in her face was my own mother’s. She contorted her face in the same anxious and distressed way my mom did every time we went to the doctor’s office growing up. Even if it was a simple, routine checkup, my mom was always on edge because she had a general distrust of doctors and struggled to understand their recommendations, due to her language barrier. I remembered how every time we went to the clinic, I would always need to reassure my mother that she should trust the doctor. I realized, looking at Hector’s mother, that although I was not equipped to give advice on her son’s medical condition, I could still offer her reassurance and comfort. 

          “Están en las mejores manos.” As soon as those simple words came out of my mouth, I saw her tense shoulders relax, as she sighed with relief. I walked out of the room feeling proud, as the attending said, “Great job. You calmed her down more than we could.” That night, I ran through Duke’s campus back to my dorm, feeling a sense of satisfaction and joy that I will remember eternally. This was the first moment in which I felt confident about my decision to pursue a career as a physician. As I progress in my pursuit of medicine, I never forget the power of comforting words and how they can make a big difference in a patient’s experience. Even now, in my current role as a surgical assistant at a dermatology clinic, I prioritize minute details that will make the patient feel supported and heard. For example, since the majority of our patients are elderly, I will often give them an extra pillow to support their knees when they sit in the exam chair, or walk them back to their car, despite a busy schedule with back-to-back surgeries. I know my actions are much appreciated, as multiple patients have expressed their gratitude over these small gestures. 

	  While I felt like I truly understood how important it is to approach patients with empathy, I wanted to feel more prepared the next time a patient asked me for my medical opinion. In order to expand my scientific knowledge, I joined a renal research program at the Mayo Clinic under Dr. Joseph Grande. The lab focused on the role inflammation has on the development of chronic renal disease. While sifting through research, I learned that Latinx and African American communities experience the highest percentages of end stage renal disease. Immediately, I thought of my aunts and uncles who suffered from a variety of kidney problems, some even requiring dialysis. I recall connecting the dots between my experiences with my mom, families like Hector’s, and this new research I was conducting. I want my place in medicine to involve helping underserved communities that reflect my background and roots. 

          Although I have grown, and am no longer the nervous 19 year old who once stood in Hector’s room, I know that I still have a long journey ahead. I will continue to be faced with questions to which I will not know the answer. While I will feel challenged and discouraged at times during medical school, I know that I can always ground myself in my motivation to help the communities from which I come from. I will continue to build a solid foundation of medical knowledge, while never forgetting to treat my patients with empathy and warmth. As long as I stay true to myself and my values, I know I will succeed in my dream of becoming a physician.","At the dermatology clinic I worked at in Wellesley, Massachusetts, the majority of the patients were elderly white people, usually over the age of 70. At first, I wasn‚Äôt sure how to connect with the patients, as I grew up in a Spanish-speaking community in Texas. Now, I was finding myself talking to people who had fought in World War II and had lived in majority white spaces their entire lives. Over time, I learned to ask questions about topics that were relevant to them, such as golf and classical music. Towards the end of my first year working at the clinic, I realized I had established strong relationships with a number of patients. One of the biggest lessons I learned is that even if I have nothing in common with the patient, I could make them feel more comfortable by asking questions about them and their lives. As I continue to move forward in medicine and interact with patients who have a different background than me, I am confident I will find a way to connect with them.  ","During high school, I had a small business of cutting lawns for people in my neighborhood. There was one neighbor who I would help out a little bit more than the others, Holly, a 70-year-old widow who lived alone. In addition to cutting her lawn, I would clean out the gutters on her roof, remove weeds from her garden, and move heavy furniture around her house. She would make snacks and I would sit and talk to her about her children, old jobs, and her mother. Even after I moved away for college, I always saw Holly when I came back for the holidays and helped fix things around the house. My favorite part about visiting Holly was seeing how happy and excited she was to have someone to talk to. I knew these small gestures meant a lot to Holly. My visits broke up her monotonous days and made her feel heard. As I move forward in my career and personal life, I will never forget how small acts of kindness can make a difference in someone else's life. ",,,1,"Right before the pandemic, I joined a research lab at the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. After working in the lab for a few months, I realized I had a good opportunity to build upon my prior research experience and work with an increased level of autonomy. Once the pandemic occurred, all work in the lab stopped and I was unable to progress further in the research. Due to COVID-19, I lost the chance to enhance my research skills and potentially get published. The pandemic also gave me perspective on living in the present moment. Originally, I was going to apply to medical school a year ago, but since COVID-19 caused me to spend the entirety of my senior year in my childhood bedroom, I realized that I should maximize each day and not wait for the future to experience the world.

My heart pounded in my ears, but everything went quiet as soon as I reached the bottom of the reef wall. Thousands of colorful fish surrounded me, and I could have watched them for hours. I was 16 at the time and had dreams of being a Marine Biologist. I grew up in rural Missouri but was in love with the idea of playing in the ocean for my job. I thrived in the first year of my Marine Biology program and wasn't ready to return home for the summer. I was hesitant because it was finally time to empty my late father's storage unit. Nestled between dusty tackle boxes and faded Western novels, I came across his diploma from nursing school. His stories about the elderly and newborn patients he loved caring for flooded my mind. Flipping through his old notebooks, I yearned to hear more about his nursing days and ask what it was like to care for patients at opposite ends of life's spectrum. Sitting in my oceanography class the following year, my peers gushed about their dreams of jellyfish genome research and advocacy for manatees. Similar aspirations weren't there for me. I struggled to find meaning through work in marine science. As I was considering other career paths, a family friend suggested I shadow a doctor at the local hospital. I had never considered a career in medicine for myself but remembered my dad's enthusiasm for healthcare. The next week, I drove across town on a chilly night and stepped foot in the ER. One patient I saw had come by EMS in respiratory distress. The doctor entered the room while nurses and respiratory therapists bustled around the patient. A woman was on the stretcher, doubled over, eyes wide and gasping for air. With a calm demeanor, the physician assessed her and quickly ordered treatments. Before long, the patient was at ease and chatting with the medical team. This was exactly the kind of direct impact that was missing in my pursuit of marine biology. After that night, I found myself googling ""roles of a doctor"" or ""how to become a doctor."" I felt I was on the right track, moving away from marine biology and toward a future in healthcare, but I needed more experiences with patients to be sure. I sought out a job as a Medical Assistant in my last semester. From sick visits to chronic disease follow-ups, I loved the variety of encounters. One afternoon, I was restocking the table paper when a coworker alerted me that the next patient had arrived. Collecting his vitals, I asked about the reason for his appointment that day. I saw the hollowness in his eyes with tears streaming down his cheeks as he told me that his thoughts were too much for him to handle on his own anymore. After his appointment, I watched as the physician walked his patient to the door, still offering quiet words of support. Meaningful relationships are central to who I am, and I was humbled by the trust present in this encounter. To have interactions with patients built on this level of trust would be a rewarding privilege. In an effort to expand my experiences in healthcare, I worked two jobs during my gap years. Recalling my excitement from shadowing, I returned to the ER as a scribe. Being exposed to endless specialties, I imagined myself in the Cardiologist's shoes, rushing a patient to the cath lab. Or as a Surgeon, sitting with an anxious patient before her first surgery. In all scenarios, I saw myself as a physician, treating a patient in their time of great need. While the ER was exciting, my time in AmeriCorp allowed me to incorporate my passion for community service and address healthcare inequality. On my first day, my supervisor whisked me around the city as we visited free clinics: one in a homeless shelter, one at the Vietnamese community center, and another at the crisis nursery. I observed how an acute illness or untreated chronic condition could unravel a person's life, especially in an underserved community. ""Ann"" came to the clinic multiple times per month. Between her debilitating migraines and a car crash that broke her pelvis, Ann could never seem to catch a break. Because of her health problems, she bounced between jobs. I assisted Ann where I could, by helping in her job search and accompanying her to food banks, but her health was the one thing I couldn't affect. It was also the obstacle I wanted to help with most, because I could see how deeply intertwined her health was with the rest of her life. Finding my dad's old nursing school books in that muggy storage unit planted a seed that I didn't know I needed at the time. It started me down a path away from an unfulfilling career and toward becoming a physician. My earliest patient encounters affirmed my desire to pursue a career in which I could form lasting and impactful relationships with others. In recent years, I've deepened my understanding of healthcare by exposing myself to areas of healthcare that are often overlooked. I want to be a physician so I can more powerfully advocate for underserved patients like Ann, who I've been fortunate to serve in my limited capacity thus far. If given the opportunity, I look forward to having a direct impact on people by treating the most central aspect of a person's life: their health.","When I was 16 years old, I packed two large suitcases and moved nearly 5,000 miles from home. I was selected to participate in a year-long program called the International Fellowship Classes. I left my small Missouri hometown behind to live and study with a diverse group of high school students from around the world. Coming from a homogenous class in my hometown high school, I was certainly nervous at first. I wondered if I would be able to relate to my new peers, especially with language barriers, but I can honestly say that leaving home and embarking on this year abroad was the best decision I could have made. At an age when my thoughts and views were especially malleable, I learned valuable life lessons by interacting with students who were different from me in so many ways. One of the most memorable lessons I learned through this experience is to always be mindful of opportunities to form a personal connection with someone.","As a Community Health Worker, one of my main responsibilities is reaching and supporting marginalized groups in the community that I serve. My role allows me to meet and work with people from many different backgrounds and with very different life experiences than myself. The community that I serve in south St. Louis has a large Bosnian population. Many of these families face the same challenges to accessing healthcare as other south St. Louis residents but with the added obstacle of a language barrier. In an effort to eliminate this additional barrier, I‚Äôve advocated for quality and linguistically appropriate care in the form of screening forms and health education in Bosnian. I‚Äôve also connected with a local pharmacy owned by a Bosnian woman and established a partnership with her to further serve the Bosnian community. Through this experience, I‚Äôve learned the importance of uplifting others‚Äô voices and offering support as we navigate and eliminate barriers together.",,,1,,1,0,3

Unable to gain more information by radio, I didn't know I had two patients – or the severity of their burns – until arriving on scene to a bloodcurdling scream that pierced the night sky. I found the first of two young women burned to disfigurement and was stunned to see EMT's pouring bottles of cool water over her violently shivering body – a direct contrast to our training of keeping severe burns dry to prevent hypothermia. However, she screamed the moment the pouring stopped and begged for it continue. The crew asked me what to do and, forced to choose between prolonging her suffering or putting her into shock, I froze in the face of this lose-lose decision and focused my response elsewhere, ignoring the pouring as it continued.

Perhaps I prioritized her comfort despite knowing hypothermia, not pain, endangered her life. However, we all collaborated before I briefly stepped away to balance two patients at once – an event reminiscent of ER shifts when I’d see one doctor manage multiple critical patients by delegating teams. Successful care required a physician equally skilled as both a communicator and a clinician. The leader sets the tone in high-stakes settings where chaos cannot reign. I aim to become that leader.

My road to medical school, though lengthy, proves linear. Growing up with a medical helicopter pilot and an ER/flight nurse meant trips to the hospital as kids for a handoff between parents who worked overlapping shifts. On busy nights I’d witness the ER’s commotion in awe, later spending years as a trauma “patient” for physicians at MCW’s ATLS course. Such early exposure to both medicine and education drew me to both careers as I became an English teacher by day and an EMT by night. My patient care interest prevailed and I went straight to graduate school, researching public health, clinical simulation, and how handoff communication impacts patient outcomes. 

My inherent drive to serve and love of patient care run deep; however, I’ve grown constrained by the limitations of EMS despite reaching the highest level of prehospital training. I feel incomplete leaving patients at hospitals with lingering questions that I long to answer, and I crave the knowledge base to search out solutions. Everything clicked when my full-time position in an urban hospital provided a front-row seat into the work of a physician.  Once I witnessed doctors balancing the roles of skilled clinician, effective leader, and real-time educator, my own career paths collided into one profession before my eyes and ignited the drive to become a doctor. My calling became instantly clear and I've worked toward it ever since. 

When I had to withdraw from school in fall 2018 to make ends meet, I focused on teaching myself MCAT subjects while balancing full and part-time jobs – the only feasible option. This employment shift in my journey proved a blessing when I led training for the second-largest ambulance service in Wisconsin. This experience also revealed my own ignorance once I ran 911 calls in Milwaukee. Early on, I judged a patient whose children slept on a bare mattress on the floor. I subsequently responded to countless barren apartments where piles of clothing served as beds. Months later, my perception shifted when I saw another bare mattress and thought “At least they have a bed."" I realize that physicians must exercise self-awareness and reflection to actively avoid bias as leaders; that experience reminds me I’m still learning. 

Years of experience taught me how patient care ownership extends beyond clinical skill and problem-solving; it requires the humility to seek help answering what we ourselves cannot, and the perseverance to lead an entire team through a perpetually strained healthcare system. Over time, I’ve embraced the satisfaction and pressure of steering the clinical ship. As an educator at my core, I’m also committed to building the future of medicine with generations of ethical, kind physicians by teaching them to approach patients as people we serve, not problems we fix. 

I recognized the healing impact of kindness and compassion in my care of “Kelsey,” the second burn patient from the night noted above. Once the helicopter arrived for her critically-injured cousin, I focused solely on Kelsey, who calmly conversed throughout our 35-minute transport despite her own serious burns. She shared her goals, fears, and even plans to start physical therapy school the following summer. Sensing her resilience, I encouraged her for the grueling road ahead with my belief that she'd undoubtedly emerge from this even stronger. Kelsey later thanked me for our conversation in an email, saying the night was “a blur” yet she remembered our talk, writing ""I was able to talk to you about so much because I felt comfortable enough."" That next July, I saw Kelsey by chance at a library as she started PT school. She leapt to greet me with a hug, unhindered by the protective compression garments encasing her arms and legs, and shared her new goal: treating burn patients. Words can't express the joy of seeing a former patient happy and healing; as a future physician, I'm elated to know she won't be the last.","While living in the city of Chicago, a miscommunication led to a terrifying encounter with police in which I was mistaken for an intruder in my own home. This humbling experience completely reshaped my skewed perception towards forceful police encounters with civilians. While in my home, officers ‚Äì with guns in hand ‚Äì opened my front door and ordered me to raise my hands, which I did. As a first responder, I've strongly supported police and believed everyone should ""just comply"" to prevent problems - until that moment. Despite their commands to step outside, I froze where I stood, confused and genuinely fearing I‚Äôd be shot with one wrong move. I was then briefly detained until the confusion was resolved; one very kind officer apologized, but another scolded me for not complying. I now understand how fear and panic, not just aggression or defiance, might influence behavior with police. I‚Äôm also perceptive of everyone‚Äôs communication and actions when viewing recorded police interactions.","As an BLS/CPR Instructor of 10+ years, I've directly and strategically led CPR education initiatives to provide instruction and certification in areas where such opportunities previously did not exist or were not economically viable. In Milwaukee, I appeared on Telemundo/CBS TV with the AHA as we - in Spanish - demonstrated/advocated for CPR in the Latino community, after which I subsequently instructed Spanish-language CPR classes for a schools, businesses, and licensed health care facility in the region. As the ‚ÄúCommunity Liaison‚Äù at the only hospital in Racine, I successfully gained CPR instructor status for hospital-employed athletic trainers when Wisconsin mandated CPR/First Aid certification for public school coaches.

By summer of 2020, COVID‚Äôs impact on Paratech forced me to quickly find a new job which shifted my focus away from applications as I postponed my MCAT again. As the demands of my new full-time teaching role overlapped with my September MCAT prep, I planned for my next attempt.

My mother came from Mexico to the United States with no high school diploma, barely any knowledge of the English language, and barely any finances to be able to survive in an apartment with 5 other individuals in San Bernardino county. Throughout my life, I had to learn Spanish to assist my mother in various social situations. In addition to this, schools in San Bernardino country have been notoriously underserved and underfunded. Many advanced placement courses and extracurricular activities, that many of my fellow college peers were able to participate in, were unavailable in my area. My high school at the time had no college advisors and the counselors of my high school could not assist me with applying to colleges outside of the Southern California region. Even the ability to afford tutors was a struggle as our family finances were primarily used to cover debts and help fund a sustainable living wage for my extended family in Mexico.

For most, those words invoke memories of roasting and carving turkey with extended family or Friendsgiving with roommates. To me, it reminds me of shouting out of a car for my mom in Spanish down the streets of Fullerton, 40 miles away from my hometown. My mom’s mental illness seemed to mimic Murphy’s law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. On top of that, all mentions of mental illness and caring for mental health were immediately met with shushes, as such conversations are seen as taboo among immigrant Mexican parents. These factors culminated in how on thanksgiving night, I found myself searching for my mom, wondering if I should withdraw from Berkeley and temporarily abandon my physician dreams to take care of my family. Yet, my tumultuous upbringing secured my desire to become a doctor and gave rise to all of the strongest qualities I embody today.
	
	I was never unfamiliar with hospitals growing up. I was diagnosed with alopecia areata at age five and then diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria at age fifteen. Additionally, I would accompany my mom to her own physician appointments, to support and translate for her when necessary. I was in and out of emergency rooms and physician offices for my autoimmune diseases and helping my mom navigate the medical system for her declining mental health. Over time, I became familiar with the settings and feelings that lingered in a medical environment. What initially was the fear of developing a worse condition became the comfort of knowing that even in the worst condition, my primary physician would work endlessly to help me survive and thrive in my state of health. The dedication that physicians had to surpass all medical improbabilities became a strong source of inspiration for me. Through this inspiration, beginning at age 15, I decided to volunteer in my community hospitals and further solidify my desire to become a doctor. As I began volunteering and interning at local hospitals, I started to view hospitals and the medical field in a new, yet familiar, perspective than I did as a patient. I realized, through both volunteering and in doctor appointments with my mom, that there was a severe lack of Spanish speaking medical personnel. Moreover, I observed how undocumented immigrants faced a plethora of barriers when it came to getting the care they desperately needed. The lack of Spanish speaking physicians and challenging barriers for non-American citizens led to my mom feeling helpless, and eventually led to the worsening of her mental health as she felt discouraged to advocate for herself with her broken English. She became exhausted with her doctors asking my dad and I questions on her behalf, rather than making an attempt to talk to her directly. This saddened me greatly as I knew her doctors were trying their best to alleviate the strain of her conditions, but that there was an overall health disparity for non-English speaking patients. As a bilingual volunteer, I began to readily offer my services to translate and provide a more comfortable environment for patients and physicians alike as I understood first-hand how frustrating a language barrier can be. Moreover, I eventually started a Refugee Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital as I recognized, from personal experiences, the constant dilemma of going to hospitals as an undocumented individual and the struggle to find a hospital that would be willing provide care. Assisting in hospitals not only strengthened my passion to become a doctor, but I realized the set of skills I had that were valuable to the medical community.

	When in late 2018, my mom’s mental illness took a turn for the worst, I had a decision to make: continue my undergraduate career 400 miles away or temporarily leave it behind to care of her. I ruminated my choices, as I knew my mom needed an advocate and translator. On the other hand, I had put in endless hours of effort in becoming a pre-med student. As a consequence of the choice I had to make, I spent restless nights worrying and my grades quickly declined. After a few unpleasant months, I made a final decision to finish my education and attempt to support my family from a distance. It was not easy helping file police reports and keep my mom stable hundreds of miles away, but I could not give up on my “American Dream” so easily. As a first generation Mexican-American, I understood the privilege that came with studying in the United States and the desire that immigrant parents hold for their children to become successful academics. Furthermore, I knew that if I continued working towards my aspiration, I could become a physician that advocates for patients just like my mom and alleviate the health disparity immigrants face daily. Even though the choice was distressing, I knew I needed to follow through on the dream I worked perpetually to flourish into a reality.

	My road to realizing my dream of becoming a physician has been arduous, yet I have embraced the challenge. Overcoming all of these challenges has made me more driven to become the physician I know I can be. As my family always reminds me, Mexicans are innovators, creatives, and above all we never give up. After all it is “Mexi-can” not “Mexi-can’t”.","Volunteering as a medical staff member at concerts all around the Bay Area has allowed me to work with an array of diverse individuals. I worked with colleagues and patients who widened my horizon to many different backgrounds and viewpoints. I learned to be more culturally competent all while doing the best I could to protect and aid the patients I served. Moreover, working with a diverse team at every event helped me comprehend the different ways one could help their patient and the best ways to respond to patients' concerns. I began including follow up questions outside of the typical A&O times 4 questions that we were required to ask. This allowed me to understand what further actions an individual patient might prefer, what precautionary measures we might have to take due to cultural or religious restrictions, and helped myself and my team understand the individual as a whole rather than just another emergency call.","In 2017, I began interning as a health advocate at San Francisco General Hospital. I would work first-hand with patients to assist them with external needs: housing security, legal documentation, and government relief services. At this time in San Francisco, there was a high influx of immigrants due to fears over increasing border control and refugees due to ensuing wars. Latino physicians and myself noticed there were several immigrant patients who needed resources to establish their life in the US. As a child of a Latino immigrant, I understood firsthand how obstacles related to assimilating to a new culture could negatively impact one‚Äôs health. I used health advocacy research to understand what services the Latino San Francisco population desperately needed and helped establish a Refugee clinic in the pediatric department to address those needs. As our patients‚Äô achieved better health and a more comfortable lifestyle, I recognized how impactful our assistance was.",,,1,"I first applied to medical schools in 2019. The pandemic hit halfway through my last semester and towards the end of the medical school cycle. As I was finishing my last courses virtually, I was working as an essential worker. As pandemic fears grew, I became lost on what I could do. Any last minute medical school interviews were canceled and I was unsure as to what my next step should be. With the uncertainty of the pandemic on my mind, I decided I wanted to help in the fight against COVID. In July 2020, I began working as a formulation technician where I synthesized oligos for research on the novel virus. I regained my footing and my purpose. In 2021, I decided to continue work on COVID by helping create a PCR detection assay for COVID and other respiratory viruses.

Expensive as they were and the amount of debt we drowned in as a result, none of it mattered to my mother. She’d tell us, “jan ou vini se jan an yo resevwa ou,” - the way you come is the way people will receive you. It was very important that we did not “look” like our circumstances. She believed what we wore provided us with an armor that shielded us from stereotypes of incompetency and miseducation, including that which stemmed from healthcare professionals. As I reflect on my experiences with the healthcare system, I wonder if my mother’s proverb held any weight and if things could have turned out differently had we remained true to ourselves.

The first time my brother complained of stomach pains, his primary care physician told us it was due to gas. She criticized our intake of Haitian food, deeming it too salty, too spicy, and too oily. And so, in an effort to resolve his pains, we deprived ourselves from the cuisines that tied us to our culture and roots. We abandoned our identity in the interests of Westernized health, sacrificed preservation to avoid hospitalization, and ironically, gave up soup joumou - our freedom soup. Unbeknownst to me, this was my first interaction in learning how individual behavior affected health. Getting sick was no longer solely due to microscopic forces that I could not understand but instead, a consequence of what we could and could not afford to eat. Although it was more expensive to reduce our intake of processed foods, we were determined to alleviate his pain by changing our lifestyle. We believed we solved the mystery of his pain, until we found ourselves in the doctor’s office once again.

The second time my brother complained of stomach pains, his primary care physician told us it was due to a stomach virus. Similar to the last visit, I noticed there were no laboratory or physical exams done. She minimized his pain and suggested we re-evaluate the spaces where we came together. Without care or concern, she patronized the large public schools we attended and the one-bedroom apartment that four of us shared. At the age of nine, obscured in this encounter was my first experience with physician bias. I realized that because my brother was a dark-skinned, athletic male, racial and structural inequalities prevented this physician from recognizing his pain. His thick skin, which could not be veiled under his Calvin Klein’s, rendered him emotionally inept. And while he might have worn his pain well, he was stripped of a favorable patient outcome.

The third time my brother complained of stomach pains, we went to the emergency room. On May 31st, 2009, dressed in our Sunday’s best, my eight-year-old brother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma cancer. That day, when the attending physician palpated my brother’s abdomen under his freshly ironed button up, he was not concerned about our attempts to make a good impression; his only concern was to provide equitable care. From the age of ten to nineteen, my life was filled with hospital visits, chemotherapy trips, stem cell transplants, CAT scans, MIBG scans, and translating medical jargon into our native language for our mother. While at that time I could not fully understand the role of equity in a healthcare setting, my experiences from that moment solidified my understanding as to what it is. It is the brand new backpacks and back-to-school supplies we received every year put together by social workers from Friends of Karen when my mother quit her job to support my brother and I full-time. It is the transportation services we received to travel two hours to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia every week in pursuit of better care. It is the grocery store gift cards and rent assistance we received from The Valerie Fund at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center when we struggled to make ends meet. As physicians identified our personal needs as part of their clinical care, used culturally appropriate language to break down complex test results, and worked with us to determine the best treatment plans, we became better equipped to deal with the circumstances we attempted to hide. Through these experiences, I learned that an impactful physician is one who is biomedically trained to provide the best care but socially trained to recognize its barriers. My desire to become a physician who advocates for my community to mitigate healthcare disparities was solidified through my interactions with physicians dedicated to our care.

Even in the face of death, my mother held firm to her beliefs: Jan ou vini se jan an yo resevwa ou, but this time with a slight modification. In the best suit our credit limit allowed, my brother rests in the most polished, blue casket. Laid alongside him are his thickly framed glasses, his overworn blue knit hat, and his favorite black, over-the-ear Beats headphones that played his favorite rap music day in and day out. Reflecting on my mother’s words, it is clear why she dressed him this way. Although there was a desire to present him in a more assimilated manner, there is integrity to being yourself. As a result, I strive to become a physician who maintains her integrity and serves as a first line of defense for those who feel the need to hide behind a shield.","In order to get the care they need, patients present themselves in their most vulnerable, authentic form. Yet, Black women such as myself are constantly chained to the expectation that our afros and kinks should be stowed away.

My experiences have shown me the way I wear my hair does not make me a better person. The way I wear my hair does not make me a better friend, and the way I wear my hair does not determine my integrity. And while I may change my hairstyle again in two weeks, my values of empathy, compassion, and self-awareness will always remain the same. As Rush Medical College is committed to training students who can connect with diverse populations, I am confident that when my patients see me, they will see themselves. We are not our hair.

For example, our Photovoice project has allowed us to empower our participants with a camera, providing them with the ability to control their narrative and share unique elements of the interplay of their environment and health that are not routinely available to healthcare providers or researchers.

I watch them intently through the inquisitive eyes of a nine-year-old, fascinated by the way they invade the ground, metastasize through the soil, and establish long colonies in every direction. This distinct memory, one of nostalgia, coincides with the phrase, “ant farm”. However, this came to mean something different when my grandmother used these two words to describe her mammogram results.

Upon hearing those words over the phone, I envisioned a network of ants multiplying and migrating down several tunnels. Coupled with my experiences in oncology, I knew this sounded like ductal carcinoma. When she asked me what an ant farm meant, I could not bring myself to deliver my illustrations. All I could tell her was to wait to see how the biopsy went.

The day the biopsy results were shared, the oncologist routinely stated the cells were malignant. He nonchalantly outlined the required surgery and chemoradiation schedule. As I turned and saw her blank stare, I knew he lost her after the first sentence. This immediate disconnect with her physician eventually cascaded into a growing mistrust in science and heightened anxiety. Little did I know, my grandmother would choose me to be an integral part of her journey. Our Sunday breakfasts meant for catching up on life soon turned into Q&A sessions on the lymphatic system and why of all people did she get cancer.

No matter how many doctors she spoke to before her surgery, she always came back to me with her unanswered questions. Even with a mere biology degree, my grandmother held my opinion in the highest esteem and looked to me for clarity and compassion. My medical knowledge, limited to fundamental biology and ENT experience, could only carry me so far. Nothing had prepared me for questions on invasive breast cancer, anatomy, or the immune system. With my expertise limiting my ability to help, I felt incapable of really being there for my best friend. Nonetheless, she still looked to me for support during the scariest time of her life.

When surgery day came, she was struck with fear. Wishing I could have taken her pain, the words of my mentor came to mind: “Medicine is 90% reassurance”. I then realized the art of this profession rested upon knowledge and emotional support, the two pillars of reassurance. Without one, patient care would be sacrificed. While the oncologists were treating the cancer, they seemingly neglected to treat the person. So, with a hug never meant to be let go and a bad joke, her tears subsided. As her journey was underway, mine was just beginning.

With this thirst for knowledge, I oriented my courses at the University of Pennsylvania accordingly. I excelled in the lessons of cancer biology, anatomy, and immunology, allowing me to restore a sense of confidence in medicine in my grandmother. As the semesters progressed, our Sunday breakfasts became more substantive and therapeutic. Expressions of fear turned to understanding and her cries were now in relief and appreciation.

Seeing my grandmother receive her last chemotherapy dose with a smile that did not fade, I noticed the beautiful potential medicine holds in our lives. Only one year of advanced biology classes equipped me with the capability to affect change in a person’s life. Marking a pivotal moment in my life, a notion of rising to the challenge overcame me and inspired me to dive deeper into this frontier of knowledge.

Joining the efforts of a lab at Boston Children’s Hospital were my first steps on this path. Conducting notable immunological research that will one day hopefully lead to an effective vaccine for millions not only advanced my critical thinking, but introduced me to the unexplored lands of medicine. I then began authoring my own research study on an unprecedented case of lymphoma, published in January 2022. Months of dense literature reviews, consults with a multitude of medical specialists, and many late nights spent writing brought me to the forefront of research on this topic. Lastly, in line with my dedication to volunteering and working towards something greater than myself, I ran the Boston Marathon this past spring while raising $11,000 for the kids at BCH. From coupling these accomplishments over the past year, I now grasp the tremendous work necessary to balance knowledge and emotional support.

Despite all my clinical experience, providing this support for my grandmother through the medium of medicine has truly shown me what it means and takes to become a physician. It is an unrelenting commitment to a purpose. It is pushing your legs to their limits everyday so one kid can watch in awe as you run 26 miles and be inspired to push past their own limits. Above all else, it is a multidisciplinary approach that integrates expertise, trust, and compassion. This challenging journey has since given a new meaning to the phrase, ant farm. Now, this phrase embodies the strength of a collective effort working towards one common goal. A unified connective network of knowledge and support, all serving the patient. With passion and purpose, it would be an honor to contribute to this cohesive ecosystem for patients to come.","As an ENT medical scribe, an immigrant family came to the practice for their son. Functioning as the Spanish translator, this family recounted to me their humble beginnings working on a farm in Guatemala, with their son by their side as they needed the extra hands to help make ends meet. Being in this dangerous environment resulted in their son injuring his ear, which required an unknown surgery at a local veterinary hospital. Our audiologist detected a rare form of hearing loss caused by displacement of the middle ear bones, which the doctor suspected was a consequence of this prior surgery. Recognizing their financial status, without hesitation the physician offered to perform a reconstructive surgery pro bono. Being the middleman in this encounter opened my eyes to the financial hardships and scarce access to quality healthcare these third world countries face. My mentor‚Äôs actions elucidated the impact physicians can make in our world, motivating me to follow in his footsteps.","I have never been one to sit by and watch the suffering of our marginalized communities due to social inequities. Seeing how lower class children are disproportionately affected in their health and well-being sparked me to start ASL Sports. Everyday, these children, whether cognitively or physically impaired, are weighed down in their aspirations by society‚Äôs systemic neglect and lack of support for them. Thus, each clinic I made it my responsibility to aid in the effort of improving the lives of these children. My sports clinics did not simply teach them how to throw a ball, but also instilled the idea that disability does not mean inability. From my countless clinics, fundraisers, and support, I have since become an advocate for the hearing loss community, strengthening its voice and public awareness over my years.

Suddenly stiffening in my mom’s arms, my infant brother was rushed to the ER while having a seizure and immediately life-flighted to another hospital. I was only ten years-old, but the time I spent in the hospital with my brother listening to the doctors give updates sparked my interest in medicine. I noted the contrast between the excellent care my brother was receiving to the lack of health care available to many in my low-income family. My budding interest in medicine became inseparable from how it is inaccessible to some. I have since sought opportunities to explore medicine and learn how I can bridge gaps in my community where inequalities exist. These experiences have affirmed that being a physician who provides compassionate, patient-centered care to underserved populations is where my passion lies.

I did not grow up in a rich family. We relied on government assistance and at times had our electricity shut off. Through hard work and a caring support network of teachers, I navigated entering college and acquiring student loans. Working full-time and commuting to save housing costs placed challenges on my undergraduate education; however, these experiences were formative in shaping my worldview and determination to make a difference.

I studied abroad in Freiburg, Germany during the 2015 European migrant crisis, an opportunity made possible by obtaining additional student loans and working while in Germany. During this time, I volunteered at an elementary school to assist children with refugee status in learning German. My first day in the classroom, I sat next to “Sara”, a six-year-old who wanted to attend school but feared being away from her mother. I asked Sara about her butterfly shirt, and although neither of us understood each other, by pointing at her shirt we were able to figure out that butterfly is Schmetterling in German and farasha in Arabic. I started to draw my own butterfly and Sara quickly joined me as we spent the day drawing various objects and teaching each other how to say them in our respective languages. I worked with Sara for a couple more weeks before she moved to a different school, and in that time, she was able to learn basic German. While I will never be able to understand the experiences Sara had before going to Germany, our time together taught me how important it is to meet people where they are. I learned that fundamental to helping someone in any capacity is prioritizing trust and emotional wellbeing.

I returned to Michigan and pursued a master’s degree in physiology to gain a stronger foundation in basic science. I began volunteering in an ICU in Detroit, and one evening, as I helped a nurse adjust her patient in bed, I immediately noticed the yellow undertone of the patient’s skin. The nurse later informed me that the patient, “Ann”, had liver failure due to drug abuse. It became routine that I would help turn Ann, and although she could not speak through the ventilator, I looked forward to interacting with her and seeing her face light up. By the third week she recognized me when I entered her room and gave a slight nod. Moments later, she coded. Doctors ran to her side as I felt my heart racing. I knew her situation was critical, but I was saddened to hear when she passed, and shocked to learn she was only a few years older than me. I repeatedly thought about what could have prevented this outcome and the obstacles she must have faced. I could not help but feel that her challenges were like those of my family as my father struggled with substance abuse my entire life, which resulted in multiple arrests, DUIs, and domestic violence. I empathized with how difficult it must have been for Ann to seek help. I admired the devotion her care team had for her and the respect they showed for her autonomy because they understood that it was her right to make her own choices regarding her substance abuse, and nevertheless did everything in their power to prolong her life. In this moment I witnessed a tremendous display of what medicine means to me—unconditionally providing for those in need.

Losing my father to the effects of substance abuse months before watching Ann do the same plagued me with the thought of knowing how preventable both deaths were. I know first-hand the impact highly trained, deeply compassionate physicians can have on families that do not have immediate access to quality healthcare. The path to applying to medical school to become one of these compassionate physicians has not been easy. I was not accepted during the 2019 application cycle, but I have persisted; I have since completed a master’s degree in physiology with a 4.0 GPA, obtained direct patient care experience as a phlebotomist, and gained invaluable research experience. Research has granted me a greater comprehension of mechanisms of disease and medical research. Through mentorship with physicians in my lab, I have gained a better understanding of what a physician does and what impact they can make. I want to honor life by using my love for science and people to promote health, especially in those without the power to advocate for themselves.","As a waitress in an Irish pub in Germany, I worked alongside individuals from many different cultures, including those who grew up in war-stricken Bosnia, left Spain and Romania due to economic hardship, and others who moved to Germany for a less restrictive government. Hearing their stories and not being afraid to ask questions in a respectful manner taught me about their traditions and worldview. For example, I learned about what it was like being in high school at the end of the civil war in Bosnia and about the workplace norms in Spain._x000D_

","As a teaching assistant in Germany, I often worked with a Syrian refugee, M, who invited me to meet her family. I spent the afternoon with them as her mother kindly gave me food to try while she prepared iftar. I taught them important German words and played tag with M. I saw how M marveled at her mother‚Äôs hijab, telling me she could not wait to wear one and look just as beautiful. I noted how important religion was for her as it marked milestones along her journey growing up‚Äîit was something that remained unchanged and part of her identity. M was old enough to notice that her culture stood out in Germany and was often too shy to talk to the older German students. As I got to know M better, she became more outgoing with me and her personality shined. The more time I spent with her, the more I saw her also open up to the German kids in her school. Similar to religion providing comfort, I served as a safe person and source of stability, helping M integrate into her new school.",,,1,"Had the pandemic not cancelled volunteer and employment opportunities, I would have re-applied to medical school following an unsuccessful attempt in 2019 without mature reflection.

2023,14788568,,27,Man,USA,1,EO2,0,1,"I was born, raised, and currently reside in South Los Angeles, an underserved community where only 5% of residents have a college education. I had to overcome a significant lack of social, educational, and safety resources in this neighborhood, including lower quality schooling in my elementary/middle school years, inadequate career mentorship, and lack of safe spaces for studying or enrichment. As the first person in my family to receive a college degree in the sciences or pursue an advanced degree, I am navigating the process of becoming a physician entirely on my own and with virtually no interaction with Latino physicians who have similar social, cultural, or educational backgrounds as me. The absence of these support networks often made me question if people like me were capable of becoming leaders in medicine. I have experienced firsthand the lack of Latino representation among physicians, biomedical researchers, and other healthcare professionals, and this has motivated me to push forward with my education and be that Latino doctor who is so desperately needed as a clinician, academic, and mentor.

My parents are hosting a small family gathering to celebrate my newborn brother’s baptism. It’s unusually gloomy and windy for a spring afternoon in Los Angeles, but this is no deterrent to a carefree six year old and his play. As the adults sip away at my grandmother’s freshly made cinnamon tea, I decide to climb our rickety swing set to impress my aunt with my monkey bar skills. I learned shortly thereafter that the Capri-Sun juice on my hands and the metal bars would not mix well. Despite the concert of mothers shouting for me to get down before I hurt myself, I climb the set, only to immediately slip and fall 6 feet into the dirt. After landing fist-first, I look down to see a bone protruding from the newly acquired 90 degree angle in my left forearm. This was the first time I had truly felt pain. Next thing I remember, a woman’s gentle voice, which I later learned belonged to that of my “doctor,” put a mask on my face and told me to blow out the magic bubblegum flavored dust. As I struggled to recall what had gotten me in this predicament, everything seemed to fade away. The amazing scent, her kind voice, and warm hand at my shoulder put me at ease as she counted down from ten. In that moment, she was at the center of my world. At a time when I was highly vulnerable, frightened, and in pain, my doctor made me feel safe. While I couldn’t have understood it at the time, this experience was one of the first instances in my life that piqued my interest in medicine and led me onto the path of becoming a healer. In becoming a physician, I hope to one day also be entrusted with the privilege of providing that same sense of comfort to patients who place their faith in me when they are most vulnerable. I believe that my intellectual curiosity and passion for community-centered care would help me achieve this goal and improve the lives of others. 
When I decided to volunteer at California Hospital, my increased exposure to physicians, patients, and the intricacies of a hospital setting further solidified my calling for the profession. Once in the ER, I met a man named Diego, who had a long, deep gash in his right leg. I could see the intense worry and pain in his teary eyes as he tapped endlessly with his non-injured foot. “I need to get better now,” he said in Spanish. “I can’t drive my daughter to school with my leg like this, and I probably won’t be able to work for the rest of the week.” He was dressed in navy coveralls, the type my father would often wear when we would do mechanic work on his car. The look in his eyes revealed to me a man whose livelihood and obligations to his family were at risk. Amidst the rushed frenzy of the ER, I reached for his hand, told him that I was with him, and that the doctors would provide him with the care he needed to return to his family. After wheeling him to an available bed and wishing him a speedy recovery, he wished me God's grace, gripping my hand tightly with both of his. He let out a sigh of relief as the ER Physician entered the room. 
I want to become a doctor so I can partake in more of these moments with patients. Diego serves as a reminder that a large factor in a patient’s wellness and healing has to do with whether they feel like someone genuinely cares about their suffering. Also, my experiences with him and other patients from my local community have inspired me to one day incorporate my fluency in Spanish and cultural awareness as a minority to connect more personally with my patients, address systemic healthcare issues, and provide higher quality care to the medically underserved. Yes, a physician needs to know how to examine the body and which drugs to prescribe, but the effects of non-medical factors such as compassion, mutual understanding, and cultural competence are often underestimated in the healing process. I pledge to adopt these values in my care. More specifically, I am called to do more for this man than just offer my words of support and encouragement. I want to not only be the one responsible for treating his injury, but also the one tasked with improving the methodologies that affect his care.
For this reason, I have dedicated my studies wholeheartedly to the sciences. As an undergraduate, I never missed an opportunity to learn more about interesting topics, ranging from Astronomy to Anatomy and Physiology. The irresistible allure of scientific discovery drew me towards biomedical research, a field that has blessed me with opportunities a young Latino from South Los Angeles could only ever dream of. Throughout my journey in medicine, I hope to build upon my interests in immunology, regenerative medicine, and cell biology to help develop cures for diseases. I firmly believe that my pursuits in academic medicine and research have enabled me to hone the critical analysis and innovative thinking required to excel in medical education and synthesize a vast array of information to improve a patient’s quality of life.
In combining my passions for research and community-centered care, I hope to one day become a physician that is well-versed in meeting the needs of a diverse patient population and bringing quality healthcare to those who need it the most.","At California Hospital, roughly half of the patients are Black. Connecting with these patients at the bedside made me realize that while we may not share a similar ethnic or cultural background, we share a community that affects the health of all of us. Black patients in my community of South Los Angeles have faced similar challenges as my fellow Latinos with regards to socioeconomic barriers, cultural biases in patient care, and a lack of providers who share their background. As an aspiring minority physician who was raised in an underserved area, I believe I can connect more closely with patients from underrepresented groups and understand the social determinants of health that disproportionately affect them in communities like my own. I am called to help mitigate disparities for patients from all backgrounds by communicating in their preferred language, understanding cultural differences in certain health attitudes, and doing my part to help minimize barriers to healthcare access.","Not one surgeon I rounded with for the Physician Mentor Program identified as Latino or had a working proficiency in Spanish. After a few weeks, I began to notice that the care team spent significantly less time in rooms with Spanish-speaking patients. Less time spent with the patient, coupled with difficulties in communication, can lead to them not understanding their treatment, not knowing what questions to ask, or how to properly prevent disease recurrence. Since I was often the only Spanish speaker in the group, I never missed an opportunity to hear their stories and make them feel like someone was listening to them. The appreciation and gratitude I received in return showed me that I was capable of making an impact on a patient‚Äôs wellness and inspired me to be the one directly involved in their care. I plan to become a bilingual physician that can help meet the needs of my fellow Latino community and minimize systemic inequalities that limit their access to quality healthcare.",,,1,"Firstly, I am blessed to have not lost anyone close to COVID-19. My ‚Äúlosses‚Äù truly are minuscule in comparison. Despite this, the pandemic did significantly alter my status as an applicant. In April 2020, my MCAT was canceled due to COVID-19. I fully committed to take it in April so that my score was available for a timely submission of my primaries in June of that cycle. With no MCAT score or clarity regarding exam security during this rapidly shifting global event, I had no other option but to postpone my application and pursue full time work opportunities, since I was now solely responsible for supporting myself and paying my own living expenses. Thankfully, I was able to secure a wonderful position conducting research at UC Davis Health and take my MCAT shortly after that yearlong appointment.

In clinic, she mentioned failing a chemistry quiz even though she exhaustively studied for it the night before and day of. She handed her notes to Dr. McClain and me- they were incredibly detailed. The material clearly made sense to her, but M blanked come quiz time. Memory function and concentration can be significantly impacted in LCH-ND patients. I saw in her face the turbulence of frustration, pain, and fatigue attached to this disease. Trying to imagine a teenager having to bear almost a decade’s worth of such experiences was heart-wrenching. Wanting to help yet unable to, I stood lips pursed in the corner as tears fell from M’s eyes. 

M is part of a study I’m currently heading trying to understand how combination chemo/BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy impacts disease presentation in LCH-ND patients. She was in complete remission 6 years ago after initial chemotherapy treatment, but relapsed in 2018. Adding the BRAFi to her regimen was a game-changer. The drug significantly decreased M’s blood cell BRAF mutation levels and the size of her maxillofacial lesions. Her ataxia score from earlier that day was the lowest it’s been in years. And, her scalp rash has nearly healed. Despite her current strife, she is faring substantially better now compared to even six months ago. 

I am following 14 other LCH-ND patients for this study. Watching scientists in my lab and physicians like Dr. McClain utilize clinical and research data to further probe the complexity of this affliction has affirmed my own desires to become a doctor. The striking vulnerability of this profession draws me in the most. Lesser studied diseases like LCH-ND compel both patient and physician to confront mortality. Though decades of experience may go into a clinical decision, nothing is absolute. Every prescription has a negation. Every choice is a frontier. The limitations of science and self are acknowledged daily. This uncertainty brings an immediacy to the moment: an immediacy of kinship and purpose for the individual’s betterment. Admittedly, I was not aware of such a dimension to compassion until relatively recently- and three years prior, I certainly did not think I would want to chase after it for years to come.

The spring of junior year, I remember my lab notebook fitfully bouncing on my left knee as three bioinformatics dot plots finished loading on Dr. Spinler’s computer screen. Quiet at first, she gradually became more animated as she deciphered the graphs. Gut microbiome population shifts were small, yet significant enough to be deemed diet induced. More testing was required but dietary microRNAs could therapeutically impact mouse gut microbiota! Walking out of lab that day, I was initially on cloud nine. Oh, the excitement! My mind raced with thoughts of diet’s medicinal utility: could microRNA biofortification of food crops be used to shape a healthier tomorrow? Inspired by agricultural giants like Norman Borlaug in high school, I’ve for years dreamt of advancing agronomy for mankind’s benefit. And there I finally was- perched on the brink of scientific discovery, with experimental findings that could help humanity clutched to my chest. This moment was supposed to be the first day of the rest of my life.

It wasn’t, however. And present day, I’m starting to understand why. Currently at Houston Methodist’s neuro ICU, I help patient care assistants check vitals, transport, and tend to admits. L is a bed bound 82 year-old lady who suffered a fall-related brain hemorrhage some time back. And every week without fail, when I go in to adjust her bed wedge, she grabs my right wrist with a vice grip. Her knuckles turn white and her hand shakes until she can’t hold on anymore. I was taken aback at first, but soon realized L was trying to tell me something. She was trying to tell me that she hasn’t given up. She was going to fight- fight her way out of the bed and onto her own two feet. That’s what I was missing in agronomy. The impersonal nature of science leaves little room for connection. That’s why, despite experiencing a momentous scientific breakthrough in lab that day, I still felt a lingering sense of unfulfillment. This pursuit did not connect me to people as I thought it would. True connection is one molded by compassion and empathy towards a human. My agronomic endeavors brought me closer to humankind, but medicine can bring me closer to the individual. Using science to initiate sweeping social change is noble, but not the way for me to find personal significance. To me, the individual is significant. Furthering M’s impetus to study despite her handicap is significant. Preserving L’s will to live is significant. Having found this beacon of meaning for myself, I hope my medical training further guides me to be an upstanding physician: persistent in his care towards humanity, one person at a time.","In kindergarten, I remember prancing around our living room while watching TV and stepping on a pencil. The sharp point lodged itself through my right mid-foot. I immediately fell to the ground, wailing in a cloud of pain and confusion. My mom didn‚Äôt know what to do. Her English was limited at the time and we didn‚Äôt have health insurance. She ended up going door-to-door in our apartment complex, pleading for help. Thankfully, our neighbor‚Äôs daughter Sofia was an ICU nurse, who was able to quickly patch me up._x000D_

I did not live under such uncertainty for an extended period of time; though I cannot fully grasp what these people may endure, I can choose to empathize and serve. I currently strive towards increasing information accessibility in medicine. Since college, I‚Äôve been fascinated with our relationship to food. Through my gut microbiome research, producing my food documentary Convenience, and volunteering for the Houston Food Bank, I work to practice compassion towards those in need.","Mentoring underserved students with Rice EMPOWER, I came to recognize the value of information.

Formative experiences like these helped me reflect on how I wish to serve my community in the future. I‚Äôve come to recognize that information drives perspective, action, and acceptance.

Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as I received a text from my friend “Allen” that stated, “I want to die.” I texted back in confusion, unable to understand why he felt that way. My confusion quickly grew into terror as he started sharing plans to end his life, and every “ding” of my phone was accompanied by a fear of that text message being the last I would receive from him. Running to my mom in tears, I realized she also did not know how to help Allen, and my heart raced as I spent the night desperately attempting to offer him the smallest ounce of hope so he would abort his plans. As the sun rose, relief fell over me knowing he survived the night. Although terrifying, I found joy in helping Allen through this crisis; however, I knew my help was only temporary. Unsure how to offer him long-term support, I turned to the internet to try to understand Allen’s feelings. I found myself intrigued by mental health and the brain as a physical organ. I started seeing my life being dedicated to being someone others can confide in when they are surrounded by darkness and from here, my eyes turned towards a career in medicine.

To further explore the field of medicine, I began volunteering as a COVID-19 screener in the oncology department. The biggest challenge I faced as a screener was at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. One morning, a woman named “Lynn” approached my table with her husband “Joe.” Lynn was here for an appointment, and I recited my list of screening questions to her. After taking her temperature, I turned to Joe and asked if he would be willing to wait in his car because we only allowed patients into the hospital to reduce the spread of coronavirus. He looked into my eyes and replied sharply, “If my wife is getting bad news, I want to be there with her.” Lynn looked at me with sad eyes, and it broke my heart explaining to her husband that he could not accompany her to the appointment due to the hospital’s protocol. Although we were able to find a compromise by letting him be on the phone during her visit, I longed to offer them more support. I wished I could be in that room with Lynn, holding her hand as she received news on how her cancer was progressing. Seeing both the physical and emotional toll cancer had on these patients only solidified my desire to help those in both physical and emotional crises. With a career in medicine, I would be able to support patients like Lynn in a more significant way, whether it be through healing them from an injury or helping them emotionally cope with a disease and being someone to lean on during difficult times. 

Being interested in the mind and body, I conducted psychiatric clinical research after college. My favorite part about this job was conducting structured clinical interviews with inpatients. I remember one patient, “Tim,” who had been experiencing depression and was admitted to the inpatient unit right before starting college. I interviewed him shortly after he left the hospital, and he revealed that he had been depressed for two years leading up to this hospitalization, causing a drastic decrease in the quality of his schoolwork and the recent loss of his job. With the stress of starting college in a few weeks and his friends and partner recently moving away, the lack of a close support system led him to a suicide attempt. After being started on an antidepressant, his mood greatly improved, and he had not felt depressed since leaving the hospital. It was incredible to see that a physical drug had drastically changed his illness for the better. With this improvement, he reported that he was excited to start college the following semester after taking some time to focus on himself. I loved speaking with Tim for several hours and learning about the numerous challenges he has faced. I want to continue to make deep connections with patients, learning about their stories and how their illnesses impact them. Although his illness delayed his start of college, medicine was able to return Tim to his baseline, putting him back on the path of furthering his education. For people like Tim, the hospital holds the last glimmer of hope that things can improve. Working with inpatients has further revealed a passion for working with people in acute distress. I want to have the skills and knowledge to help reunite people with the things their illness took away, helping them heal and return to a life of normalcy. 

My experiences have shown me that medicine is more than making diagnoses and providing treatment. Throughout my life’s journey, I have found a passion for helping people in crisis. As a physician, I look forward to helping people heal, hearing my patients’ stories, and connecting with them on a deeper level. I want to give my patients a voice and empower them to live life to the fullest. I am excited to work on fixing problems and understand the humans underneath them-- listening to the hardships my patients have faced and celebrating the victories they experience.","When I started conducting clinical interviews as a psychiatric research assistant, there was one group of disorders that I was uncomfortable with: substance abuse. Having lost a loved one to a drunk driver, I came into this job believing many stereotypes of this population. I did not understand why someone would let themselves become addicted to a substance. As I began interviewing this population, my viewpoint quickly changed. I remember ""Zack,"" who described a history of childhood physical abuse, ultimately leading to opiate addiction in his 20s. He had been in and out of rehab for several years, trying to get clean but struggling greatly. Hearing stories like Zack's has helped me understand the mindset of addiction and the pain this population experiences. These illnesses impact every aspect of their lives, including their daily functioning and relationships. I quickly learned to view a person as a whole, not as a diagnosis.","Cornell's peer mental health counseling training program questioned how we could transfer our program to an online format due to the COVID pandemic. Being in-person helped create a group identity and allowed students to bond before and after class, building trust with each other. Our biggest concern was: how do we create an environment where students can build rapport with one another through a computer screen? A team of myself and four other trainers met weekly over the summer to brainstorm how to overcome this transition in the fall 2020 semester. We piled into a zoom call, clicking random buttons until we mastered various features. We created new skill exercises utilizing breakout rooms and the whiteboard feature. We ultimately had a successful transition. The majority of our 90 students we onto the next level of training. I am thankful that we could still create an environment that allowed students to be vulnerable to one another and learn skills they could use to help their peers.",,,1,"I had originally planned to volunteer at Cayuga Medical Center starting in March 2020; however, my start date was delayed to September due to COVID. I was also originally going to volunteer in the Emergency Department; however, I was switched to a COVID screening position in the oncology department. In my peer mental health counseling experience, we switched to only conducting counseling sessions over the phone and ultimately decided to suspend the service starting in November 2020, cutting my counseling experience shorter than expected. My time conducting research at Cornell and being on the Cornell Concert Commission were also suspended in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic.

2023,14801235,,27,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"I believe I would be considered disadvantaged due to Las Vegas being medically underserved for the majority of my childhood.

As a first-generation child of immigrants, it was bestowed upon me to serve as a translator, interpreter, and historian for my Spanish-speaking parents, aunts, and uncles. Being merely 8- years old, the nature of these conversations was often out of my grasp. I struggled with how to communicate a family history of leukemia, diabetes, and extensive heart disease when these were alien-like words to me. However, as the years passed, I communicated the excessive thirst, frequent urination, weight gain, dizziness, and headaches that eventually led to my mother being diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension. I later understood how important it was to accurately communicate a patient's symptoms. The alien-like words I was exposed to as a kid piqued my interest in medicine. 

This interest and desire to become a physician were further cultivated by my own healthcare experiences. Serving as a scribe for an oncology & hematology clinic exposed me to a side of medicine I hadn't yet seen. I learned what the whole process of diagnosing entailed. Extensive medical history, family history, pertinent negatives, and seemingly unrelated symptoms are pieced together, like a puzzle to form a cohesive diagnosis. Once, I was present in the room when a patient was told they had cancer; this was a humbling experience. I recall being upset earlier that day that there was traffic and my favorite coffee was out of stock. At that moment, all my trivial problems vanished. I was struck with feelings of empathy and awe as I observed the patient say “I will beat this'' as tears stained her face. I want to be a doctor to deliver these difficult conversations with compassion and develop their treatment plan.

As a scribe, I also served as an interpreter for the many Spanish-speaking patients in the clinic who mirrored my family. It was hard not to see my parents and grandparents, who bore overwhelmingly similar socioeconomic circumstances. My encounter with a 60-year-old woman who had just been diagnosed with mesothelioma was a full-circle moment. I was able to aid some of her confusion and fear by being a source of familiarity. Relaying to her the extent of her cancer, available treatment options, imaging, and the urgency in which these had to occur was a challenging task, one where I had to find the strength to convey this without worry or fear in my voice. This further motivated me to become a physician to help bridge the cultural and language gap that exists locally and nationally. 

In contrast, my earliest experiences in healthcare were in the realm of pediatric cardiology, where the gravity of situations is often expertly masked with fun and the promise of a gift from the treasure chest at the end. Having congenital aortic stenosis, my earliest memories have always been in Dr. Mayman’s office. He always made me feel safe and took the time to explain my condition in a manner I could actually grasp as a kid. He diminished the fears I later had concerning my heart and future health. Dr. Mayman further impacted my future health by being a source of encouragement and support in my struggle with childhood obesity. He never shamed me as other adults in my life had, but made healthy eating and exercise seem fun. This nurtured a dedication and determination to lose weight in order to be the healthiest version of myself as I could be. In him, I saw a mentor and someone whose empathy, compassion, and understanding I hope to emulate one day as a physician. I aspire to become a physician to impact and support another child's health, much like Dr. Mayman did mine. 

At the time I didn't know it, but the theme of heart health would come to be a repeating arc in my life. Heart health, or rather the lack of it, would come to be the demise of three of my grandparents. At the age of 12, I experienced the death of my grandfather. I couldn't understand how the man who always protected me could succumb to illness so suddenly. At that moment, I learned death doesn't discriminate and can happen no matter how loved a man was. I felt so helpless, like a passive bystander who could only watch as her grandfather collapsed on the floor. My maternal and paternal grandmothers' subsequent deaths 10 and 13 years later bore a similar arc of lack of access to specialty care in a rural community. The closest cardiologist was 3 hours away and trying to schedule one visit, let alone multiple regular visits, was timely, costly, and often unattainable. While I know nothing can stop death, I can't help but wonder if access to regular specialty care might have extended their life span even if only a couple of years. 

These experiences molded my desire to increase healthcare access to rural communities that so deeply need it. I hope to one day add to the growing community of physicians who are already working to remedy this inequality nationally and internationally. I want to become a physician to help bridge the cultural and language gap evident in our community. My experiences as an oncology scribe, translator, and interpreter will aid me in my journey to become a well-rounded and empathetic physician; I will no longer be just a passive bystander.","Growing up, my whole family was devoutly Catholic- weekly outings to church and pilgrimage trips to Mexico surrounded my childhood. This was true for 12 years of my life. At this age, my aunt announced she had converted to the faith of Jehovah's Witnesses (JW) which shocked everyone. I did not know what JW believed and had trouble understanding how my aunt could ‚Äúabandon‚Äù our family. As time passed, however, I understood she was not abandoning us just because she was transitioning to a new religion. Instead of dissecting the reasons for her decision, I accepted her choice because she is my aunt and I love her. I‚Äôll admit when I learned she would not accept blood transfusions because they are against her beliefs, I was shocked. I couldn‚Äôt understand how she could deny something the doctor, who had her best interest in mind, recommended. Eventually, I realized while her beliefs are not mine, I respect them. My aunt brought a diversity of beliefs into our religiously homogeneous family.","I have volunteered with disadvantaged populations through the Operation School Bell program by helping facilitate a back-to-school shopping experience for kids. They choose school supplies and clothes. My first time volunteering at this event was inspiring; I couldn't have predicted the joy the kids expressed. I also have volunteered at the Las Vegas Rescue Mission, which provides meals and shelter. I helped prepare the dining hall, clean the dishes, and serve the food. I got a holistic view of what helping this underserved population entailed. It was unlike anything I had ever seen. I learned just because you are an adult doesn't mean you cannot face significant struggles that can result in being left without a home or health coverage. I learned never to judge someone's situation and to treat everyone with kindness and respect. The empathy and compassion I developed for these underserved populations is something I will continue to reflect on in my pursuit of a medical education. ",,,1,"The pandemic was a turning point in my academic career. In this uncertain time, when everything in the world shut down, my classes moved online. Having never taken online courses, it was a big change for me. Ultimately, I adjusted to this online format and thrived in my last semester of college. I found I enjoyed online classes as they had recorded lectures I could refer to at my leisure. Apart from completely switching my learning dynamic, the pandemic canceled the shadowing and research opportunities I had lined up. However, the pandemic motivated me to pursue an avenue of volunteering I hadn't ever thought of- hospice. The elderly population was one of the most affected by the pandemic. I chose hospice volunteering to provide the needed support that was lacking. People were cautious about leaving their homes, and as a result, the number of volunteers dwindled. Ultimately, the pandemic was overwhelming, but I gained the love of hospice volunteering.",1,1,2

As the samples divert to the pre-analytical modules and analyzers, I can't help but think of the doctors and patients who depend on these machines. I currently work for Beckman Coulter, a company that sells diagnostic analyzers to clinical labs. My official title is ""Field Service Engineer,"" but in truth, I am a repairman. I maintain massive automation tracks in large hospital systems across the Chicagoland area. These tracks process up to 1,450 samples per hour, taking over all the steps in sample processing, including centrifugation, aliquoting, sampling, and storage of the specimens. Any track downtime significantly impedes physicians' care decisions for patients. I joined Beckman Coulter to combine my engineering background and passion for technical problem solving with the ability to have broad impacts on patient care. Supporting healthcare infrastructure is not glamorous, but it's satisfying to know that my work helps thousands of patients receive the treatment they need.

Part of the satisfaction of my work comes from knowing that infrastructure like the automation tracks allows doctors more time with their patients. As a Medical Scribe for Dr. Fotso, I witnessed the large impact that a little extra time has on patient care. Dr. Fotso runs a Family Medicine practice in a fast-paced outpatient clinic. Being trilingual, she has built a large patient population, specifically in Hispanic communities in Chicago's western suburbs. As a scribe, I aided Dr. Fotso by recording procedures, diagnoses, treatment plans, prescriptions, and follow-up information, often listening to conversations in Spanish and transcribing them in English. Early on in my role, I learned to predict the treatment plans for common conditions for her patient population: increased metformin doses for diabetic patients with consistently elevated A1cs and decreased lisinopril doses for hypertensive patients after weight loss and diet change. But there were often more complex cases where the technical solution was unclear. I struggled to imagine how Dr. Fotso would handle a patient suffering from severe depression following her sister's suicide or a patient with terminal liver cancer who confided in us that she couldn't bring herself to tell her loved ones that she was dying. In these moments, Dr. Fotso always took extra time to simply sit and listen, even with a packed schedule. I saw how this patience and grace had built a foundation for trusting relationships with her patients, allowing them to be vulnerable and share their feelings of fear and uncertainty. For me, it was a lesson that it's often the humanistic, not the scientific, side of medicine that has the most impact. It showed me that great caregiving requires a commitment to understanding the entire patient.

While working as a Medical Scribe, I also volunteered as a Sexual Assault Victim Advocate, where I began practicing the caregiving techniques I saw Dr. Fotso use with her patients. In my role, I traveled to emergency rooms throughout DuPage County to counsel survivors, offer them resources, and educate them on different legal and medical options after these traumatic incidents. With 99% of all sexual assault perpetrators being male, I was mindful that my presence could be a barrier to the healing process and that earning survivors' trust was paramount. Over time, I learned to tune my body language and stay soft-spoken to communicate to survivors that they were in a safe space. Helping survivors work through their feelings of fear, anxiety, pain, confusion, and guilt was challenging. I came to see that no two survivors' healing plans were the same. Some needed to pursue legal action to find peace and healing, while others simply needed a confidant to externalize their experience. Working as an advocate showed me that effective caregiving requires a tremendous amount of self-awareness and adaptability on the part of the provider. Patients deserve personalized treatment plans, and physicians must uncover each patient's unique needs to guide them in the right direction.

Through these experiences, I've seen that practicing medicine is not all that different from the operation of the automation tracks that I work on. Similar to how the centrifuge separates a specimen's different layers before routing to the necessary analyzer, a physician must separate and understand all components of a patient before guiding them through one of the many clinical pathways toward healing. A physician must use their technical knowledge to physically treat a patient; however, it is those humanistic skills – interpersonal warmth, patience, and a willingness to listen – that allow doctors to understand each patient's perspective. As an engineer, the technical side came more naturally to me. But over time, I learned the humanistic side and realized it is the driving force in my path toward becoming a physician. As a future Family Medicine doctor, I look forward to merging these two facets of medicine to guide patients with individualized care plans.","When Roberto, a Spanish-speaking patient of Dr. Fotso‚Äôs, came in for a hospital follow-up visit, he explained how thirsty he‚Äôd been feeling. Reviewing his chart, I saw that he was prescribed two medications for his newly diagnosed diabetes. During the encounter, we found that he wasn‚Äôt taking either medication, and his blood glucose level was over 500mg/dL. Before probing for the root cause, I assumed he wasn‚Äôt taking the initiative in his health; however, I discovered that he misunderstood his treatment plan through the interpreter._x000D_
_x000D_
In retrospect, as a native English speaker, I realized I‚Äôd taken my healthcare accessibility for granted and assumed Roberto had the same knowledge of diabetes. This experience taught me to refrain from prematurely faulting patients and instead, strive to understand and help them overcome the limitations they face in their care. In doing so, we can work toward providing education and resources to vulnerable populations to help close our nation‚Äôs care gap.","As a Sexual Assault Victim Advocate, I helped survivors overcome their horrific, life-changing experiences. I worked to create a trusting, non-judgmental space for survivors to share their experiences and emotions to help lead them down the best path to healing. I calmed one hysterical survivor by facilitating breathing exercises, offering a hand to hold, and reiterating that nothing that happened to her was her fault. After establishing trust and validating her emotions, she confided in me that her uncle was her perpetrator, and she was scared to pursue legal action even though she knew it was best for her emotional healing. After hours of discussion, I assured the survivor that she wasn‚Äôt alone in her journey. By supporting this survivor and connecting her with various legal and counseling resources, I helped her uncover what was best for her overall well-being, and she courageously opted to pursue legal action and perform a medical evidence kit to begin her healing process.",,,1,"Upon graduating, I planned on gaining more clinical experience during my gap years. Due to COVID-19, I struggled to find available clinical opportunities. Although limited, I still felt a call to action to help the struggling healthcare infrastructure in any way I could. Four months into the pandemic, I got the opportunity to contribute as a full-time Medical Scribe for Dr. Fotso and volunteer as a Sexual Assault Victim Advocate. As a scribe, I helped Dr. Fotso with her administrative duties, thus enabling her to catch up on an appointment backlog by scheduling more patients each day in an already underserved Hispanic community. As a Sexual Assault Victim Advocate, I helped provide care and healing to survivors of trauma who otherwise might have fallen through the cracks. Although the pandemic limited the available opportunities, I worked hard to find clinical experiences that allowed me to help provide care to members of my community while also making me a more well-rounded caregiver.",1,0,2

I was referred to Children's Hospital in Los Angeles for a barrage of tests. There I met my childhood hero, Dr. Kaufman. She made me feel safe in a scary place. As my endocrinologist, she ruled out cancer and diagnosed me with precocious puberty. From then on, I received monthly injections from my pediatrician and visited Children’s Hospital multiple times a year. It was the compassionate care that Dr. Kaufman provided that originally inspired me to become a physician. I want to provide a sense of safety for patients like she did for me. Working as an EMT in the field and alongside physicians in the hospital for almost a decade has caused my initial curiosity in medicine to bloom into a lifelong passion.

I worked so diligently in school to become a doctor that I earned a scholarship to a prestigious private high school. Unfortunately, after transferring there in 11th grade, I found that homophobia was commonplace. At a time when I was coming to terms with being gay, it was hard to be in a school that codified their opposition to LGBTQIA+ rights in their policies. I ended up dropping out, but I was undeterred from my goal of becoming a physician. I went to community college to finish my high school diploma and start my pre-med coursework. I was also able to get into UC Berkeley for Molecular and Cell Biology and complete a hands-on hospital internship which confirmed my desire to become a doctor.  

The first code blue that I witnessed during my internship was a transformative experience. A man in his twenties came into the ER with chest pain. An EKG revealed that it was a STEMI and within minutes he went into cardiac arrest. I’ll never forget the rapid, tactical response of the hospital code team as the patient’s eyes rolled back into his head. They placed the pads on his chest and restored a pulse with a single shock. When the man started talking again, it felt like I had witnessed a miracle. Seeing the ER nurses and physicians save his life has been a major influence on my pursuit of medicine and my deep interest in emergency care. 
My fascination with the ER motivated me to become an EMT. I have had so many meaningful patient care experiences as an EMT, such as my first serious trauma call at the retirement community. At four in the morning, an elderly man tripped and fell on a glass table. I found him on the floor in a pile of shattered glass bleeding profusely from his head and complaining of neck pain. Being the only EMT on shift, I simultaneously held his c-spine stable and put pressure on his head wound. I told him the fire department was on the way and that I would be here for him until they arrived. I saw his overturned walker and made a joke about him needing to take some driving lessons which put him at ease. I loved providing care in the field as an EMT, but I wanted to do more.

When the pandemic hit, I pivoted to the hospital environment to work more closely with physicians and help address dire staffing shortages. As a patient transporter in radiology, I made an effort to read imaging reports and assist with interventional radiology procedures. This gave me a deep appreciation for the work that radiologists do in both diagnosis and treatment. I remember seeing my first CT-guided biopsy of a liver mass—I helped the radiologist, Dr. Acquarelli, collect the sample and hand it off to a pathologist who determined it was benign. The fact that they could diagnose a condition by simply looking at a scan or a slide amazed me. This is an ability I hope to possess one day. 

After years in the healthcare field, I secured my ideal pre-med job as an ER EMT. The ER doctors I work with are inspiring. Whenever we have a critical patient, a calm settles over the room when the doctor walks in. We recently had a patient in SVT with a heart rate of 210. She was terrified. I repeated EKGs and set up for a cardioversion while asking the patient about her family to distract her. Dr. Moya, the ER doctor, walked in and put her hand on the patient’s shoulder. She explained the effects of adenosine in a calm and soothing manner. The nurse administered the medication at the doctor’s order while I performed a Valsalva maneuver by lifting the patient’s legs in the air. Her pulse rapidly shot down to 80. I want to provide definitive care like Dr. Moya that can pull patients out of scary situations.

Providing patient care alongside inspirational physicians like Dr. Moya and Dr. Acquarelli has continuously reaffirmed my desire to become a doctor. The seed planted by Dr. Kaufman has been watered by the many kind physicians I have met along my journey. As I reflect on my path to medicine, I am reminded of a quote that I pass by every day at Cedars-Sinai: “The bridge between doctor and patient sustains both.” Throughout my life, the doctors and patients that I interacted with have kept me both grounded and motivated to move forward. The more I have learned about medicine and applied it to practice, the more fulfilled I have become. I would love to bring my knowledge of patient care to the next level in medical school. I know that charting a course to restore and maintain the health of people as a physician is my true calling.","I have worked with a variety of diverse populations. I grew up in a suburb, so I wasn‚Äôt really exposed to those less fortunate than me that often. In my first EMT job, I transported unhoused psych patients who were detained by the police during a crisis. We would wait for hours at psychiatric facilities. The conditions and care they were subject to was abhorrent. I learned that our mental health system needs improvement. It creates an unending feedback loop.  They get released after 72 hours and come back weeks or days later to the same facility.  I also worked directly with inmates at LA‚Äôs largest jail. In listening to their stories I often found out they had been suffering from a condition for weeks before they were provided care. I learned that I want to make conditions better for underserved communities. We need more funding for safety net programs and to address the social determinants of health. We must fight gentrification and urban decay, and improve healthcare access._x000D_
","We need more LGBTIA+ physicians, especially with the increase in people identifying as transgender and non-binary. Just recently I had a transgender patient who came into the ER for suicidal ideation. She was misgendered and misnamed multiple times by staff. I was able to advocate for her by offering to be her sitter. I informed all staff of her preferred pronouns and name. We need to change how the healthcare system treats LGBTQIA+ people._x000D_
 I am the first person in my family to be openly gay. This was hard to come to terms with since I live in a conservative community where casual homophobia was common. Coming out was difficult, but I paved the way for my cousin to come out too. I‚Äôm passionate about impacting the queer community in a positive way. Queer people are much more likely to be unhoused, have mental health issues, and commit suicide. I hope that I can introduce policies to deal with these problems and increase healthcare access for all underserved communities. _x000D_

I was also able to review newly published research on IBD and COVID-19 at home until our lab re-opened fully at my research job. After my CDC job ended, I wanted to keep up my clinical skills and help the sick during the pandemic. I took the first hospital job I could find as a transporter. I was able to minimize suffering under catastrophic conditions.

I never used to think of myself as a morning person, but the prospect of going to work at Dermcare has me excited to start the day. I spring out of bed. Yes, I will take that cup of coffee, thank you. My racing heart is not caffeine-induced; my excitement for another day operating as Chief Medical Assistant has my heart pumping.

Assisting physicians during surgical procedures and office visits in the dermatology clinic synthesized my passion for hands-on clinical work and finding novel solutions that materially impact lives. After several months, I was offered a leadership role and worked even harder. Leading the team gave me immense accomplishment and pride, heightening my enthusiasm for providing patients with the highest standard of care. I looked for solutions to make the office more efficient while never sacrificing the care a patient would receive. I gradually became adept at collaborating with my fellow staff, finding room for improvement, and accepting responsibility for the actions of those on my team.

One regular patient still stands out: Leo (alias). Leo is deaf, and the first time we met, his anxiety had understandably got the better of him. I had to take special care to ensure he understood the procedure he was about to undergo. I assisted during his first Mohs surgery to remove a squamous cell carcinoma from his nose. The clinic was fast-paced, but I always endeavored to elucidate the nature of the procedure at length for the patient's comfort. As Leo read my lips, I could feel his tension dissipate. The mere explanation of each step and subtle movement of my lips brought him closer to comfort and healing. While this job provided me with a strong foundation for a future in healthcare through clinical skills, it was just as critical to continue to practice soft skills. I understand how important it is to be able to comfort someone, to patiently listen, communicate clearly, and emphatically advocate for my patients' needs. Talking to Leo pre-op was a seminal experience because I learned two things: First, I had developed an effective and compassionate bedside manner, sufficient to calm down even challenging patients, and second, I felt called to continue this work for the rest of my life. I want to continue studying via medical school because I want to be able to educate, advise and comfort using the knowledge I have learned.

Clinical experiences with patients like Leo illustrated to me the need for innovative medical solutions and my desire to apply them hands-on. My background in research was driven by a desire to solve the structural challenges faced by the human body. This hope propelled me to jump at the challenge of working at the Infant Vision lab at Boston Children's Hospital. I researched Retinopathy of Prematurity, a curable form of blindness if treated early. I created a novel predictive model that could assess the children's future eyesight up to 20 years post-diagnosis, enabling us to predict their future visual acuity. I love creating these models, and moreover, I want to implement them hands-on, seeing how my work directly affects people's lives. I have consistently positioned myself at the cutting edge in the hopes of pushing the field's boundaries. At the Harvard Medical School's Kreiman lab, I worked on creating a customizable head-mounted display for blind people that provides audio guidance to describe their surroundings using artificial intelligence and helps them navigate the world independently. While running experiments on blind participants, I heard firsthand from them how most present-day technology does not work for differently-abled people. This calcified my determination that medicine must seek scientific means to tailor treatment to the individual and make these tools accessible and more affordable for patients.

At Neuro-Electronic Research Flanders in Belgium, I taught paralyzed mice how to walk again and investigated the mechanisms of circuit assembly behind their locomotion to potentially apply our findings to people with spinal cord injuries. The opportunity to investigate promising research that can transform patients' lives was edifying and intellectually stimulating.

Presently, I have been re-hired as a Pharma-Collaboration Associate at Benevolent AI, a London-based drug discovery company seeking new therapies for undertreated diseases. My end goal has always been clinical medicine, yet I believe this role will help me to formulate and implement cutting-edge solutions in the field.

The spirit of reform and equality is core to my desire to work in this field. I have lived abroad before and seen alternative models of care, from the UK's NHS to Japan's SHIS, which inspire me to work toward reforming American healthcare. 

I am resolved to contribute to the lives of my patients by creating and applying avant-garde solutions to medical problems. I am ready to dedicate my life to this mission. I have proven my capacity for leadership, excellence in care, and innovative methods. Medical school will teach me the necessary skills to make my vision a reality to provide compassionate care, implement cutting-edge innovations and help impact people's lives for the better.","I lived on a rough street for many years in college. It was a street people avoided at night because of a large tent encampment and a hub of gun violence._x000D_

I was heading out to get coffee and offered to buy him a cup. Returning with caffeine, I asked if I could sit with him. After exchanging names, I asked if he felt comfortable sharing how he ended up on my front door. His story was unexceptional but tragic. By no fault of his own, he had lost everything. A man, down on his luck, with no safety net. His story could easily have been my story. Or my parent‚Äôs. Or anyone in America. Before I left, I gave him a blanket and my new unisex hiking boots.

I was the medical assistant during his melanoma excision. He suddenly became aggravated in the middle of his surgery and accused us of scamming him. He tried to stand up and came close to breaking the sterile field. This was a huge issue; he could give himself an infection. I reassured him and calmed him down. I saw his anger came from a place of fear. The explanation of the procedure soothed him, so I talked through the rest of the surgery. Afterward, we sat together until his family returned. I saw how medicine is deeply personal because people are at their most vulnerable. My presence made him feel more comfortable by lessening his fear and keeping him safe from touching the incision. A seemingly small act of compassion and understanding can have the biggest impact. As medical professionals, often the most important part is not the physical care we provide but the emotional support we give patients. _x000D_

My parents worked tirelessly and sacrificed a higher education to provide the means to pursue our dreams. Thus, I did not have the luxury of having my own room or bed, as I shared with my father. My father handled his grief poorly when my grandmother and aunt perished in that catastrophic plane crash. He became an abusive alcoholic. Ultimately, he left our family without a word about his whereabouts. As a result, my mother could no longer afford the mortgage, leading to the foreclosure of our apartment. We were homeless but found refuge with my grandparents in a crowded house with six residents. Therefore, I slept on the floor with a mat so my sister and mother could sleep on the couches. Despite the circumstances, I was grateful to have a roof over my head, food on my plate, and surrounded by people I loved. I expressed my gratitude to my grandparents by helping them with chores and caregiving, such as medication and transportation to doctor appointments.

My heart rate elevated; sweat beads raced down my body; my knees began to wobble. Twelve hours prior, we had received a life-altering phone call. My grandmother and aunt were on board Air India Flight 812 when it crashed upon landing. Amidst the ensuing chaos, we booked the next available flight for the funeral. When the plane approached the runway, I began hyperventilating, and the knot in my stomach tightened. I was initially perplexed by this feeling, but in hindsight, I realized I had a panic attack. My mother sensed my inner turmoil and held my hand, which eased my anxiety. That day, I learned that challenges could arrive suddenly and that tribulations do not have to be confronted alone.

While I could not tell her, my fascination with medicine stemmed from my time with my grandmother. She was diabetic and had a walking impairment. As a result, we formed a partnership; to compensate for her immobility, I became her insulin courier and observed each injection. Galvanized by the prospect of a cure, I joined a research lab in college to investigate the induction of hepatic insulin secretion. I was ecstatic to apply my classroom knowledge to a cause close to my heart. With each pipette, I imagined a future where daily injections would become obsolete, preventing others from becoming insulin-dependent. While the lab work satisfied my craving for problem-solving, I considered research too impersonal. 

I coveted personal relationships like the one I had with my grandmother, which can only be achieved through patient-physician partnerships. Therefore, I joined Adapted Fitness, an organization aiming to encourage exercise for people with physical disabilities. This club was the catalyst for my companionship with H, a lady with muscular dystrophy and a positive attitude similar to my grandmother’s. H’s goal was to enhance her ability to stand and walk. Thus, I curated an exercise regimen suitable for her goals and household with limited equipment. I taught her how to perform step-ups on a staircase to strengthen her legs and utilize her couch headrest for assisted squats to build her core stability. Moreover, her mental fortitude seemed to surpass her physical limitations, enabling her to persevere through adversity. H compelled me to change my definition of health. As a former athlete, I defined my wellness by tangibles such as speed and strength. However, H’s wellness was not limited to such measurements. She taught me how my perception of an individual can evolve and how patients can enrich my life. Due to our lengthy companionship, I observed a striking improvement in her independence, which affirmed my ambition to become a physician. I cherished improving the mobility and self-sufficiency of someone like my grandmother. 

Observing H, I saw that her care was not limited to physical therapy. It encompassed multiple disciplines and modalities of healing. I was drawn to participate in a healthcare setting that implemented interdisciplinary treatment. Therefore, I became an ophthalmic technician at a retina clinic. One memorable patient, T, was an elderly man who had a tractional retinal detachment caused by diabetic retinopathy. I conducted the fluorescein angiogram that elected T for surgery. I simplified the steps of the procedure, giving T the confidence to proceed with the surgery. After T’s PCP faxed us his clearance, we scheduled him for surgery. Finally, at his post-operative examination, I read the notes sent by the surgery technician and removed his bandage. T’s gratitude for my role in saving his vision invigorated me, and I was proud that my collaboration with like-minded individuals culminated in T’s recovery.

While striving for the best outcome for another patient, S, I formed an unexpected connection due to her resemblance to my past. S had symptoms of a typical retinal detachment and feared losing her vision. Moreover, S had an aversion to eye care exacerbated by an anxiety disorder, making it challenging to administer eye drops and obtain intraocular pressure. I called upon my past trauma to soothe her fears. I reached out my hands for her to embrace. Her distress, on the other hand, was only marginally alleviated. I needed to modify my approach, so I guided her through a breathing exercise. Consequently, her anxiety subsided, and I performed the necessary tasks for the vision examination. This encounter left me with an indescribable feeling of fulfillment. I valued that I could share this moment of vulnerability with another person. This closeness reminded me of my relationship with my grandmother; it cemented my aspiration to be a physician.

My life experiences repeatedly tested my resilience, but each time it strengthened my compassion and emotional intelligence. As a physician, I will utilize these strengths to implement holistic, patient-centered care that integrates mental wellness and personalized treatments to preserve a patient’s autonomy. Furthermore, only medical school will allow me to collaborate with others who share my passion for medicine. Ultimately, I aspire to provide people with the greatest quality of life, commemorating my time with my grandmother and reviving the bond I treasured so dearly.","As a phlebotomist at a plasma center, our donor demographic was mainly underprivileged people. One donor was an African American man, C, who tried to make you laugh whenever possible. C had notoriously tricky veins. The first time I stuck C, his encouragement gave me the confidence to perform a flawless venipuncture. He donated twice a week and requested me each time because we formed a bond and he trusted my skills. He was never upset when I failed, despite losing significant income. With each donation, I learned more from him, such as life in a group home. When I told C about my recent financial struggles, he advised me to apply for food stamps, which helped me greatly. I learned that being vulnerable with others enables you to grow, even if they differ substantially. Then, one shift, a coworker told me that C had died from a heart attack. That was a difficult day because I valued our time together and never expressed gratitude for his uplifting jokes and helpful advice. ","_x000D_

I felt my heart sink as I listened to my college roommate weeping. A year prior, I lost a friend to suicide. Just as I felt guilty pondering whether there was more I could have done for my late friend, I noticed my roommate harboring similar feelings toward her late father. Over time, she began to express suicidal tendencies herself. While we each shared our own unique experiences grieving, I understood how important my support was for her. I was grateful to be there for her, listening to her and sharing my coping techniques. I validated her feelings and shared my vulnerability with her to confirm a mutual understanding that vulnerability is healthy. Although overwhelming at times, together we worked to address and express her pain and reestablish her sense of self-worth. Her first smile and chuckle, weeks later, will forever stay with me.
 
My experience with my roommate fueled my desire to search for opportunities in which I could have a positive impact on others. After much exploring, I decided to volunteer as an elementary school mentor. My mentee was reserved and struggled with making friends. Over the course of our first few meetings, I noticed he rarely smiled. During recess, I noticed my mentee avoided other kids, often isolating himself to an empty area of the playground. I sensed his anxiety and I opened up to him by explaining how we shared similar experiences when I was younger, in hopes of establishing trust. I shared what helped me feel more comfortable in my own shoes and make friends when I was his age. With time, he became more comfortable with me and those around him. I watched as he gradually befriended other kids in his grade. On the last day of my mentorship program, my mentee handed me a picture he drew. I unfolded the drawing to uncover the image of a smiling boy holding hands with a girl. I pointed to the boy in the picture and asked my mentee, “Who is that?” Beaming with joy and displaying a smile larger than life itself, my mentee said, “Me and that’s you!” I was overjoyed at the difference I could make through something as simple as mentoring. I still keep the drawing with me as a reminder that the impact of empathy bears no age limit.
 
Upon completing my undergraduate degree, I knew I possessed a passion for science. However, I needed to see first-hand how understanding the complexities of the human body could be directly applied to improve lives. Thus, I took on the role of a medical scribe in an outpatient rheumatology office. Following a long day of seeing patients, we would finish the day by catching up on patient phone calls and prescription requests while the rest of the staff went home. On nights I felt particularly burnt out and exhausted, I thought back to my experiences with my mentee, my roommate, and my late friend.
 
My drive to persevere was further cemented when following up a year later with a patient confined to a wheelchair. While charting the HPI, I noticed the patient’s voice began to quiver as he explained how his deteriorating health had caused unhappiness and a decline in his will to live. I glanced up from my computer to see several tears leave his eyes. As he continued his story, I struggled to fight back tears. I remember the doctor asking the patient what he wanted most, to which the teary-eyed patient responded, “I just want to walk again.” While handing him tissues, we briefly locked eyes. In those few seconds, his blue eyes became oceans filled with pain and sadness that I felt in my core. I wanted nothing more than to help restore his happiness. As I returned to my computer to finish charting, a small glimmer of happiness came over me and offset some of the sadness I felt. Why? There was no place I’d rather be than helping the patient.
 
I often reflect on the potential experiences of my late friend and roommate’s late father; their cries for help were regularly overlooked. The sadness of my roommate’s trembling voice as she spoke the words “committed suicide” still echoes through my ears. Helping my roommate through her grief taught me how to endure hardships and remain optimistic in the face of adversity. My experiences have shown me that suicidal thoughts and tendencies can frequently be associated with chronic illnesses and have become increasingly prevalent in today’s society. Much like I guided my mentee and roommate, I want to guide my patients to improve their health and wellbeing. Being a physician is more than possessing a body of knowledge enabling one to prescribe a drug to treat a medical condition. Scribing has helped me realize that being a physician requires the ability to blend knowledge and empathy and this is where I believe I can make a substantial societal impact. While scribing has emphasized my desire to pursue medicine, my experiences with my roommate and mentee have taught me how to integrate common knowledge with empathy. I yearn for the opportunity to integrate medical knowledge with empathy to treat patients, ensuring my patients’ cries for help are no longer neglected.","Growing up as an East African, Pakistani Muslim female in a predominantly White community, I was made out to be the ‚Äúother‚Äù that did not belong.

After graduating, I became a mentor for immigrant Afghan students. I feared that these students would feel pressures similar to the pressures I felt. I wanted to ensure that these students embraced their cultures as they entered into a country which was foreign to them. Working with my students has provided me with an amazing opportunity to learn more about their culture as well as develop a deep appreciation for their experiences. I have learned how to be an advocate for my students which has taught me the importance of trust, patience and persistence. I will never forget the feeling of being able to connect with my students, share our cultures and understand their concerns.","My brother attended a work event one night and hadn‚Äôt returned the following morning. His phone was located in an impound lot along with the remains of his car. He had been taken to UCLA Medical Center.

I formed a wellness group to help address fear and pain through communication, yoga and breathing techniques. Eventually, I worked to further expand my group and began including mindfulness practices. I focused on helping others be more present in the now as well as increase their ability to regulate emotions and decrease stress. I intended to help others become more fully engaged in life. It was rewarding to watch the development of personal growth for those in the group.

Scanning the room, I felt my nerves escalate as the medical team prepared me for surgery. After battling with drug-induced lupus throughout my junior year of high school, I was blindsided by the new diagnosis of an ovarian cystadenoma which was growing at an alarming rate. However, my OB/GYN was always nearby to ease my trepidation. 

Within minutes of speaking with her, I was comforted by her confidence to perform this surgery laparoscopically. Though technically more elaborate, this procedure aimed to preserve instead of remove my ovary, as I was previously informed. And after seven hours in the operating room, that was exactly what happened; the huge mass was removed, and the ovary remained intact.

Fortunately, within a short time since diagnosis, I was treated. Yet, despite the promptness, I reflect on that experience with serenity, undoubtedly due to the surgeon's professionalism and attentiveness. As I headed to college soon after, I credited this experience with steering my interests toward accessible health care and women's health. 

During my early college years, the opportunity to become a birthing doula presented itself, and I began exploring how I could play a part in the OB/GYN field. From learning about induction using Pitocin to observing C-sections, I approached each labor and delivery shift as though it was an immersive lecture with a new topic. While closely observing the nurses and doctors, I simultaneously comforted the mothers by positioning them in poses that promoted dilation, providing words of affirmation, and encouraging teamwork among the family.

The labor and delivery unit housed a variety of childbirth complications. Despite the unpredictable nature of these cases, they were counteracted by the efficiency and professionalism of the medical team, a group I was privileged to work with. As I immersed myself into their environment, I had to adapt to their experienced pace; I learned to appreciate and understand their fervor in caring for patients. However, I was unsure of my own impact amid the intense experience that is parturition, and I questioned whether my efforts to help the women were futile.

During an early morning shift, I attended to a woman who spent hours contracting with minimal progress. Surrounded by the soon-to-be grandparents, she had little energy left and a look of defeat. I reassured her that she was capable, and since she did not have the epidural, I guided her through positions to alleviate her discomfort. By implementing movement, she quickly took to pushing and soon delivered her child. As I headed out after saying congratulations, the newly dubbed grandmother expressed her gratitude and declared, ""Your good nature and warmth helped my daughter tremendously today."" As we embraced, I smiled at the healthy baby coddled in the new mother's arms. This experience left me with a refreshed perspective and a solidified career goal.

It was at that moment that I was reminded of the gratitude that my mother received from her patients, even during casual run-ins at church or the grocery store. She modeled compassionate patient care through her routine early morning hospital visits and lengthy patient calls in order to mitigate their worries. Having had the opportunity to meet with many of her Hem/Onc patients after receiving chemotherapy, I was proud to hear about my mother's positive role in their lives. And as I started to make similar connections of my own, I gradually understood my purpose to care for, empathize with, and treat those in need.

I was able to explore this purpose further when I conducted a research project on women's reproductive health in Puerto Rico. This class project gave me the opportunity to speak with local Puerto Rican women suffering from the lack of accessible health care, especially due to the damages caused by Hurricane Maria. I was touched by the obstacles they overcame: one woman even delivered a child during the hurricane without any phone connection, electricity, or medical care. Aware of the magnitude of the nation's public health problems, our group, in collaboration with Senator Vargas Vidot, fundraised to alleviate the challenges of the Puerto Rican people, including the women deprived of adequate medical attention. By implementing needed health initiatives at both community and nation-wide levels for Puerto Rico, I have developed an overwhelming appreciation for accessible health care. 

Many factors, starting from childhood, have influenced my decision to become a physician. Throughout my journey of self-discovery in the healthcare field, I have come to understand that my affinity in the medical field lies with prioritizing the patient. In an ever-growing field that is medicine, I appreciate the challenges that stimulate my mind, but my patient interactions, especially from the labor and delivery unit, stand out most. An emotional and compassionate connection transcends all other forms of communication, and similar to how my surgeon cared for me, I am determined to pursue that quality of care throughout my medical career that emphasizes and prioritizes the importance of the patient's well-being.","I had the opportunity to go to Puerto Rico to research about women‚Äôs reproductive health and talk with organizations about their relief efforts after Hurricane Maria. The community suffered major blows after the natural disaster, and I was able to hear about the goals of these organizations and how they strove to provide accessible health care and education to the Puerto Rican community. While there, we met with an organization which focused on emergency preparation for the community, and another which helped to reintroduce incarcerated people into society. Among meeting these various motivated groups of Puerto Rico, I connected with the locals and witnessed first-hand the importance of health equity, especially for those who were stripped of accessible health care. This trip helped refine my cultural competence, exposed me to a new and diverse community, and emphasized the importance of social justice in providing the Puerto Rican locals with the opportunity to lead a better life.","I volunteered as a doula at the labor and delivery unit of the NYU Langone Hospital Long Island. This was one of my first positions in a real health care setting where I interacted with new patients and their families. This was also the first time I worked with a team of nurses and physicians. I assisted in natural births as well as C-sections. I was trained by the Long Island Doula Workshop and volunteered over 100 hours helping women during parturition by providing both physical and emotional support. Most of the time, the women and even their families have expressed gratitude at the attention given to the woman during labor. Some have compared previous labor experiences and have truly emphasized appreciation to my continuous assistance. Although it may be a subtle detail during the event of parturition, I am grateful to have positively impacted their experience and to have alleviated any discomfort they had on the unit. I aspire to care for my future patients in the same manner.",,,1,"Starting in March of 2020, it was challenging to find a study location for school and for the MCAT. I found the transition difficult because there was not an obvious division between home life and student life. Since I was used to using local libraries as places to study and complete my school work, their limited hours affected my initial progress on my medical school applications. After some time and experimentation, I grew an affinity for working on my application in nature, whether it was in my backyard, parks, or beaches. Galvanized to find more areas in the outdoors, I explored more of Long Island and exposed myself to new study locations, from Queens to the Hamptons. As I began traveling around, I was able to create a balanced work-life relationship once again and genuinely enjoyed working on my application.",1,0,1

As we entered the classroom, the teacher announced the activity to the gaggle of squirmy first graders around her: squid dissection. Most of the girls shrieked in horror. I shrieked in excitement. As the carcass was peeled apart in front of us, revealing three hearts and an ink sac, a curiosity was sparked in me that led to a passion in science and medicine that still grips me today. 
My fascination with anatomy developed into an interest in medicine in high school. I shadowed at the Montreal Heart Institute where I observed surgeries, attended rounds, and met with researchers. I was inspired by the inventiveness of geneticists unearthing data from failed drug studies in search of new possible targets. It was clear that medical breakthroughs require deep understanding of physiology, but also imagination, and I started to apply myself in more creative ways. For example, in high school I developed the concept for a device involving spider silk and tension-triggered spring-loaded pistons to prevent sports-related overextension injuries. 
Studying evolutionary anthropology at the University of Michigan, I began to see humans as people, not just as organisms for study. Previously, I had considered a disease like obesity to be the direct result of poor lifestyle choices. Through this new lens, I learned that while individual behavior does play a role in health, external influences like structural racism, lack of environmental protections, and socioeconomics present immense barriers which must be considered when developing healthcare strategies. Following this interest, I conducted my Honors Program thesis research on the role of the environment on genetics and phenotype in climate-adapted populations. I am eager to learn more about cultural, evolutionary, and environmental determinants of health and how to use this knowledge to help others. 
Following graduation, to continue work in genomics and medicine, I joined a biotech company where I learned how collaboration, flexibility, and compassion are key to healthcare research and delivery. While I was helping manage a large gene-based cardiac drug trial, the COVID-19 pandemic began to tear through our vulnerable patient population and study centers around the world. We had to act quickly and flexibly in the chaos to ensure our study was not significantly impacted while prioritizing the safety of our subjects. I was moved by the compassion and commitment the physicians showed to their patients, sometimes traveling great distances to hand deliver study drug. I was drawn to this compassionate side of medicine.
In parallel, I discovered what gives me utmost joy in life: giving to others. In 2017, I joined charitable organizations like the Rotary Club of Ann Arbor, where I could be of service in my community in an immediately tangible way. Welcomed as the youngest of more than 300 members, I was intimidated by this group of community leaders many years my senior. However, as I immersed myself with enthusiasm, I found it was a perfect environment for growth and development. By taking on roles to strengthen weak areas of the club, I became a committed volunteer and leader. As I served as a mentor for at-risk high school seniors, I saw many of my fellow mentors having trouble connecting with their students. I taught the mentors how to better relate to their mentees, helping bring new enthusiasm and students to the program. Within 2 years I was elected Director and Board member and featured in Rotary International’s magazine. In this role, I have helped the club grow, improving its processes and presence in the community. Giving in this way started me on a search for a career with similar impact.
	In 2019, I suffered a trimalleolar fracture which required two surgeries to repair, and the pieces of my story abruptly came together. Through interacting intimately with medicine in this time, one path that could bring my passions, skills, and interests together became evident: medicine. To ensure this was the right decision, I began volunteering at the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System, primarily in the surgical department. I saw some of the challenges veterans face – PTSD, depression, poverty, and homelessness – and how care teams address disease in conjunction with these challenges. When a patient arrived for a possible thyroid cancer diagnosis, the clamor in the waiting room triggered his PTSD. I found him a quiet room to wait instead and stayed with him. It was gratifying to see some of his anxiety melt away as we chatted and laughed together. 
Though providing this emotional support was important, I was unable to give the relief that excising his tumor would. I am eager to train to become a physician capable of relieving physical ailments while caring for patients as dynamic individuals. Each day I am involved in the healthcare field, my commitment to further my education and my ability to positively impact others by pursuing a career as a physician has strengthened. What began as a mere fascination with what’s hidden beneath the skin has developed into curiosity, creativity, compassion, and commitment, which I am confident will allow me to develop into an excellent physician.","For years I have had an interest in the Arab world. I have taken opportunities to learn more by visiting Arab-focused museums, art exhibits, and events, as well as by consuming media showcasing Arab perspectives. Most impactfully, I attended Friday prayers at a Mosque with a Muslim friend. I was excited but nervous to experience this vital piece of the Islamic faith. I was given a hijab to cover my hair, one often used by children, with a pre-cut opening for the face. I entered the basement of the Mosque with the other women, as the sexes were separated, and became acutely aware that I was the ""other."" However, I was immediately welcomed by those around me ‚Äì my interest in their culture overjoyed them ‚Äì and I was humbled as I fumbled through the motions of prayers.

When she entered the STRIVE program, she had a grade point average of 1.5. She knew attending college would help improve her life, but she did not know how to get there. Throughout the year, I worked with Catera to help her develop better studying habits to improve her grades, fill out her college applications, and even open a bank savings account. I was incredibly proud at the end of the year when she received a 4.0 and was awarded the highest scholarship amount. Since then, Catera has taken college classes and is on her way to a better life.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced challenges that have reduced my ability to gain clinical exposure before applying to medical school. It was only in July 2021 that I decided to pursue a career in medicine, having graduated from college over four years prior. That summer, I began conversing with physicians from nearby hospitals and clinics. Though these discussions were valuable, my requests to shadow were turned down due to safety protocols implemented at their institutions._x000D_
The Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System, the location of my long-term volunteer post within the surgical department, paused in-person volunteering for four months due to the Omicron variant surge. This caused my clinical exposure and volunteering time to be reduced._x000D_
In addition, the clinical research job I had held since May 2016 was eliminated at the end of Dec 2021 due to budgeting issues at the company caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",0,0,3

One night our movie marathon was interrupted by a streak of alternating red and blue lights that had pierced through the window. While the siege of Helms Deep was ongoing, my mother was experiencing another manic episode – this time in my front yard for the entire neighborhood to see. Growing up with a mother who suffered from alcohol dependence and prolonged depression, I had become accustomed to these events. The officers explained to me that if I could not calm her down they would be forced to detain her. So, I confronted her in the street with the hopes that I could talk her down– but my efforts were futile. While the images of tail lights rounding the corner offered some immediate relief that the night was over, this sensation quickly subsided with feelings of powerlessness.
Several days passed before my mother returned to our battered living room. As soon as she walked in, she gave me a gripping hug and began to thank me. She revealed how my repeated attempts to console her over the years afforded her the reassurance she needed to carry on. Though I felt undeserving of her gratitude, I was just happy to have my mother back. But beyond this, I was left empowered in my ability to connect with others and be a source of comfort.
After years of looking after my mother, I became interested in medicine and began scribing for an emergency department. One night, a soft-spoken man with tattered clothes was brought in. He was apprehended after wandering aimlessly in traffic and escorted by EMS for medical evaluation. Though the man appeared to be in good spirits with no medical complaints, the self-induced cuts along his arms told a different story. I had seen this same mask growing up. 
“Is everything alright man?”
With a deep exhale, he detailed how he became homeless after being laid off. Despite having family in the area, he was abandoned because of his schizophrenia. The cruelty of his situation had suddenly dawned on me. If he had suffered from a more socially acceptable illness would his family have still abandoned him? If I had not been there for my mom where would she be? With the weight of this truth off his chest, I could see a look of appreciation in his eyes. This simple gesture of listening meant more to him than I could have imagined. My upbringing laid the foundation for what I could not fully comprehend until this moment. Care is not limited to a medical intervention but also requires a human connection. This visit helped me codify what I wanted most out of my career – the opportunity to use my training and experience to serve others in their most dire straits.
With these lessons, I began volunteering as a literacy mentor for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and home-lives similar to my own. One of the students I worked with was a fourth-grade Hispanic boy named “Jose” whom I was told had a learning disability. The teacher cautioned me that due to his limitations I should not expect much improvement. Knowing the power of labels and the stigma associated with them, I was motivated to support him in any way I could. After only a few visits, I discovered that though Jose struggled reading English, he excelled in Spanish and was far from disabled. From a boy reluctant to even speak with me, Jose was now bringing his own books for us to read. By the end of the summer, he had progressed an entire grade level above where he started. To see a child be dismissed based on a label, just as the man from the ED was, showed me the value of advocating for the voiceless. These small efforts to individualize care were ultimately the most meaningful aspects of their experience.
Reflecting on my past experiences I consider myself fortunate. Fortunate because being raised by a mother with mental health issues taught me that care is holistic and extends beyond medical intervention. Fortune to have lent an ear to a man struggling with his own mental crisis. Fortunate to have positively impacted a youth population that reminded me so much of myself. Together these lived experiences culminate into a creed I strive to live by: to treat each patient as family, to offer the support needed to share their experiences, and to advocate for the powerless in a system that often fails to do so","Most days, I take a virtual passport and practice Spanish with people from around the world through language exchange apps. Through this, I have made a friend named Sadaf. She is a student from Iran with aspirations to study abroad. She also happens to be proficient in Farsi, English, and Spanish. _x000D_
I had built this preconceived notion that Iran, and moreover, the Middle East, was the antithesis of western culture. News outlets and politicians would have you believe that our lifestyles are incompatible. But the reality is far from stereotypes or headlines. By getting to know Sadaf and her culture, I discovered that there is far more that unites us than divides us. I began to understand that people's differences stemmed from the environment they were brought up in. I learned that by focusing on our shared humanity, you can open a window into an entirely new culture. In a nation where we are taught to be fearful of strangers, I aspire to approach diversity with an open mind and arms.","Every week I volunteered at various elementary schools around the Fresno School District to help students with their math and reading. While my house was a brief 20 minutes away, the drive to South Fresno underscored a tale of two cities. From the windowless classrooms to the playground devoid of a playset, it was clear that these students faced an uphill battle. The pandemic left many students on an academic hiatus. This had drastic downstream effects on the students‚Äô academic and emotional development. I sought to address this issue by engaging with students in a way that left them excited to learn. Whether it was illustrating a passage or turning a few paragraphs into a time trial, I knew that developing their interest in learning would be vital. The payoff was at the end of the year when I was able to see the marked improvement in their standardized testing. But beyond improving their scores, I believe I was able to guide these students to be their own advocates for success.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has barred my ability to volunteer in a healthcare setting. All hospitals and clinics in my area have suspended their volunteer programs preventing me from taking part in this vital step of patient care. As it stands, these COVID policies are still in place with no mention of when they will resume regular volunteer operations.",1,1,2

Growing up in a house that served as a sanctuary for many Cuban refugees, I was used to giving up my bed to family members and friends that would stay with us for months at a time. Instead, it was the subtle moans of pain that came from the other side of the hung-up bed sheet separating my grandmother's bed from that of Rosa’s, a middle-aged patient. Diabetes was what her sister explained to me as we scoured the different floors, eventually bringing back a chair from the waiting room for her to spend the night. I had just learned about Diabetes in my college Physiology course and that night I was too absorbed in scientific literature to sleep, devouring information on how lifestyle and dietary changes could offer a potential treatment. 

While I later went on to publish a study on calorie intake and the risk of insulin resistance, through research I have realized my passion for actively searching for solutions and trying to comprehend a situation. I think back to my time as a research diver with the Diversity Project in Moorea. While en route to Gump station, our base for the summer, I saw a man holding a sign that read: “Fresh Fish, NO Ciguatera.” Over conversations with locals, I learned how parts of the island are avoided due to encounters with fish that cause ciguatera poisoning. I thought back to the patches of algae that would find their way into my scuba gear and wondered how this alga could serve as a contributor to instances of ciguatera. My group and I began fieldwork, ultimately learning how the algae expansion may potentially increase the rates of this fish poisoning. 

In my approach, I tried to emulate a physician I had observed while volunteering at Nicklaus Children's Hospital. Simon, a young boy I was tasked to play with presented with severe asthma. He was too tired to play and so I sat beside him watching King Kong as the physician spoke with his parents. In conjunction with treating his symptoms, the physician pried deeper and through conversation, it was reasoned that the mold in the household could be an active contributor. After following the treatment plan, a few weeks later I saw Simon again. This time the room was filled with laughter as we launched plastic monkeys into the air. I was amazed by the impact that this doctor had on Simon's life. While the solution was not directly apparent, through communication and collaborative reasoning the physician was able to reach it. My journey into the world of research has instilled in me a desire to learn about natural processes, starting with that which lies beneath our own skin. While I further explore this scientific curiosity at the NIH, I hope to see my work on the CRISPR-Cas9 system contribute to improving treatment plans for patients like Simon, as our studies in Moorea may help the community in preventing ciguatera. 

While research offers a means to expand my knowledge, working directly with patients provides satisfaction that remains unfulfilled with sole benchwork. I remember the early stages of quarantine vividly and from what was on TV, I thought all people had the privilege of living in the comfort of their homes. That’s when I received an email from my team, the Dade County Relief Response group, that emphasized how the homeless population in Miami was in need of our help. Immediately plans were put into place and as a team, we ventured out towards the greater Miami area to administer resources and COVID tests. In comparison to the rest of Miami, here it didn't look like we were in the middle of a pandemic. Here there were no comforting shelters, no germ-x at every turn, and certainly no masks. A population left to fend for themselves. As I handed out hand sanitizer bottles, I couldn’t help but reflect on the harsh reality of the disparities in health care. I thought back to my time at the hospital and how the presence of a chair could have helped Rosa and her family feel more comfortable. During my first shift, I interacted with individuals like Gloria, who was afraid of the nasal swab test. While our team physician, Dr. Armen, performed COVID tests on others, I slowly gained Gloria's trust. As we sang along in Spanish to her favorite artist Celia Cruz I acknowledged her fears and thoughtfully explained the test until Gloria confidently received her COVID test, later smiling at her negative result. It’s in these moments with individuals like Gloria that I have seen the importance of understanding and catering to a patient's individual needs. These situations further fuel my desire for genuine human connection and to address the needs of those underrepresented in medicine. 

As I continue to live through diverse experiences, what I have come to understand is that while I was excited by the knowledge behind Diabetes that night in the hospital, it’s the potential of seeing the application of that knowledge help a boy play again and laugh as he launches monkeys into the air that draws me to the field of medicine. I hope to combine my passion for science, problem-solving, and human connection in following the next steps to be able to regularly improve patient and family lives as a physician. I reaffirm this interest everyday in my current roles.","Growing up in Miami, I was accustomed to having friends from diverse backgrounds. While I always felt comfortable with diversity, my move to Maryland has shown me that I was not accustomed to the lack of it. My new friends all assumed that I was Mexican. I was asked a few times if I speak Mexican, and have heard phrases such as how Shakira, Pitbull, and Enrique Iglesias are all great Mexican artists. After learning more about my friend's upbringing, I understood that they have not had the same experiences as me and that I am the first Cuban American that they have come across. In response, I encourage open conversations where I teach them about Cuban culture, and I am equally interested in learning more about their experiences. As I see my friends today excited by Cuban culture, I‚Äôve realized how by encouraging an atmosphere of mutual respect and by trying to understand another person's perspective I have the chance to learn from others and also share my experiences with them.  _x000D_
","While working as a soccer referee in the city of Miami, I noticed considerable differences in field conditions depending on the area in which the school was located. I thought about how minority groups have less access to quality resources, education, and opportunities. I decided to help those that are not granted equal opportunities and began to serve as a volunteer tutor for children in my neighborhood whose parents were undocumented. I especially remember Maria. Maria‚Äôs parents did not understand English and they could not afford tutors which tend to come at a high price, in turn, she was struggling in school. I would help Maria by reviewing her homework, teaching her concepts, and helping her navigate a computer. My time with Maria helped to lessen the impact of obstacles to her education that are particular to children from minority groups and low socioeconomic backgrounds. With this awareness in mind, I hope to continue breaking down these barriers moving forward in my career. _x000D_
",,,1,"Studies have shown that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID. I was made aware of this discrepancy while volunteering with the homeless population in Miami over quarantine. While providing resources, I noted how for this population access to masks and other preventable measures was limited. While helping Dr. Commodore with her research I also learned how the pandemic highlighted issues such as the link between air pollution exposure and health disparities. Because of the pandemic, I am more aware of existing health disparities and I am committed to helping improve this situation. I also worked as a clinical research coordinator for a COVID study. In this role, I noted the struggles that patients and families are facing while managing the side effects of the virus. By engaging with patients and families during these difficult times I have recognized the importance of providing empathetic care which I hope to continue to do as a physician.",1,1,2

Several issues complicate care for these communities, including physician distrust, language barriers, and lack of experience with people on the Autism spectrum. Language barriers hurt the quality of care and can have potentially dire consequences. An example that embodies this is when my grandfather moved from Mexico to the United States, bringing only his dreams, clothes, and foot sores from inadequate access to healthcare. Initially, he refused medical help as he worried he would not receive appropriate aid due to his inability to speak or understand English. By the time he agreed to go to the hospital, his sores had developed into gangrene, which required surgical intervention. During his stay at the hospital post-surgery, he struggled to get basic help because of the lack of available interpreters and miscommunications due to his dialect's subtleties. As a child, I recalled when my grandfather explained his time at the understaffed hospital, where even asking for water or a blanket was a daily challenge. This event was my first exposure to the feeling of powerlessness many Latinos face within the U.S. healthcare system. It motivated me to build trust between Latinos and physicians to better healthcare access and outcomes. 
In addition, the gap in high-quality care that many individuals with autism face due to lack of experience was highlighted by my brother's experience. He was taken to the Emergency Department because he complained of stomach pain. The team handling his care had limited prior experience with autism, and thus my brother’s disability was overlooked. My brother was not able to communicate vital information about additional symptoms. His illness was dismissed as stomach flu, and he was sent home. Weeks later, his condition worsened, and he returned to the E.D., where his stomach pain was diagnosed as pneumonia. After his diagnosis, my brother’s condition severely progressed to the point where he was admitted to the ICU for multiple weeks and placed on a ventilator due to his lung function deteriorating. On my visits to him while in the ICU, I asked the nurses if they had experience with people on the spectrum, and the overwhelming answer was no. Thankfully, my brother eventually made a full recovery. To this day, this event continues to haunt my family as this harrowing experience made me realize that not fully understanding underserved groups can be a considerable detriment to adequate care and its lasting effects. As a result, my parents still hesitate to bring my brother to the hospital for fear of similar experiences. This is not how healthcare should be thought of, and this inspired me to become a doctor that treats the patient holistically and provides patient-centered care to those with disabilities.
After being discharged from the hospital, getting my brother the services needed to catch up with his missed class time was extremely difficult, so my parents tasked me with facilitating his growth. I can recall times when he became easily frustrated with tasks, so I developed a reward system to improve his patience. After each homework assignment, I would let him play with toy cars for a set amount of time. If he had good behavior at school for the month, I bought a “Hot Wheels” set of his choice. Teachers would call to comment on his improvements from the practices I did with him. The joy these calls brought me fuels my desire to become a caring and compassionate physician and seek out current physicians that embody this.
I was fortunate enough to witness the incredible power of a compassionate physician when I interned at the Darrow Stem Cell Institute. Dr. Darrow performs stem cell procedures at the clinic to treat musculoskeletal disorders. Patients are often initially skeptical, as treatment is done with minimal anesthetic and with the patient awake. I witnessed him go above and beyond with a patient who initially declined treatment due to his phobia of needles. Dr. Darrow answered all questions and discussed at great length about the patient’s military history to gain his trust. The patient proceeded and benefited greatly from the procedure. The humanity he never fails to show his patients has instilled in me the type of care my brother and grandfather deserved during their stay at the hospital. In this experience, I learned that medicine is more than just a set of skills, it is fundamentally about the relationship between people. 
My experiences growing up in a predominantly Latino community and seeing family members receive subpar healthcare has made me aspire to become a physician- to give back to the communities I grew up in, and to address healthcare disparities. I have learned to treat patients honestly, I must foster a close relationship with them. I have the desire, along with the determination, to promote health care equity within the underserved minority and autism communities. I will make the most of every opportunity given to me and be a valued addition to your medical school.","Growing up in a predominantly Hispanic area, my worldview was expanded once I entered undergraduate. As I met my current girlfriend's Filipino family, I had the opportunity to learn about the country's history and how that contributes to their health. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are common issues in the Filipino community due to their traditional high-sodium and high-fat dishes._x000D_
_x000D_
As a medical scribe, we had a patient of Filipino descent struggling with controlling their hyperlipidemia without using medications. I talked with the doctor about certain dishes to include in their discharge instructions to make their treatment plan easier to follow, which led to more favorable outcomes._x000D_
_x000D_
With this background, I would like to share my experiences with my peers and improve my overall understanding to close the gap in healthcare access. The culmination of these experiences has taught me to be mindful of cultural differences, especially in medicine.","Fitness is an integral part of my life, particularly for my physical and mental health. Because my brother is autistic, I know firsthand how difficult it is for those with disabilities to interact socially in sports or perform independent performing activities. Therefore, I joined Strive, which helps autistic adults transition into independent living. However, Strive did not teach the importance of diet and exercise. I incorporated small activities for my students, such as stretching to improve posture, basketball games to teach social skills, and taught fundamental nutrition at Vons to improve their diet. When our program was informed of the student activity improvement, I was gratified by providing my students with tools to augment their lifestyles. As a physician, I will focus on treating the patient rather than the symptoms in medicine. I have seen that every person is different and sometimes requires treatment plans tailored to them.

Deep down, I have always wanted to help people the best I can. While in high school, I chose to volunteer weekends at my local children's home, tutoring English, math, and science for kids ages 11-13. I shared knowledge and any bit of advice I had with the exceptional children under my wing. I was, in return, humbled by the impact that I left on them and that they left on me. In high school, I chose to pursue science because I found biology and chemistry intriguing. My love for the sciences and urge to help the communities around me fueled my enthusiasm to venture into the medical field. From high school science courses to premedical coursework in college, I maintained my drive for the medical field by satisfying my growing curiosity about the human body.
A little background about myself: I was born and raised in Ethiopia and moved to the United States when I was 18 years old. Although Ethiopia is one of the fastest developing countries in Africa, it is among the many medically underserved nations globally. Most medical facilities are in the capital, with only a few in the rural towns where most of the population resides. The inadequate medical care and resources result in much unnecessary suffering and in severe cases, death. I observed both private and government-funded medical facilities: the insufficient contribution of the country's income to the health sector and the difference in the quality of care found in these two types of facilities fueled my interest in pursuing the medical field. I hope to one day help decrease the gap in access and quality of health care in Ethiopia through the collaboration of local and US hospitals. 
In college, I ventured outside of my comfort zone by partaking in extracurricular activities and taking classes beyond the sciences. My first and second years were challenging due to my financial status and having multiple jobs on campus. However, I utilized various resources on campus and learned that it is okay to ask for help. In doing so, my family and professors gave me valuable insight into managing my time better. I found that balance between my academic, extracurricular, and work commitments. Being a part of the African Student Association as vice-president showed me the qualities a good leader should have. From open communication and delegation between people of different backgrounds to planning events, I learned that teamwork and motivation were necessary for a productive team. 
As an ER volunteer for two years, I developed in-depth interpersonal communication skills by observing and practicing patient-physician interactions. After volunteering, I shadowed physicians with various specialties (cardiology and obstetrics-gynecology) in the ER and ICU. Learning about each one and gaining direct patient contact experience by assisting physicians increased my fascination and desire to make my own contribution to the field. As a student and colleague of numerous talented people, I knew that I was a step closer to becoming the doctor I wanted to be in the future. I want to be a compassionate and hardworking physician that provides maximal care to patients. I always want to keep learning from my future professors, peers, and fellow medical researchers to be the best practitioner I can be.
Attending a liberal arts college helped me develop a more open-minded perspective. By engaging in various academic pursuits, I gained a profound respect for and understanding of the human body. Upon graduating, I wanted to gain more hands-on experience in the medical field and become a better prospective medical student. During the pandemic, healthcare workers' hard work and dedication inspired me to keep contributing in ways that could help my community. I worked as an ABA behavioral therapist for children with autism. Being dependable and adaptable were critical skills I learned and put to work in my day-to-day responsibilities. I was patient and understanding and gave it my all, cooperatively working with my colleagues to devise and implement daily plans for each child. I enjoyed every day and worked towards my individual growth and towards being there for the people I worked with. 
Soon after, I joined the army, became a medic, and got my EMT license. Enlisting was a big commitment, and going through basic training was both physically and mentally demanding. Resilience and attention to detail were crucial skills I honed through this process. I was tested beyond what I thought was my limit and questioned myself when things got tough. What kept me going was thinking about why I joined the army and what the future holds for me. My primary motivation was my goal of becoming a doctor and learning how to work in a stressful environment while keeping my emotions in check. Learning to assess, treat patients, and follow up with documentation in different medical scenarios was exhilarating. I firmly grasped the ethical obligation we have to ourselves, our peers, and our patients. I am grateful for succeeding and gaining some invaluable lessons that I will take to medical school. My struggles and accomplishments have contributed to my personal and educational growth, making it possible for me to stay determined.","I work as an EMT at Smiley's Family Medicine Clinic at UMPhysicians. Sometimes I come across Ethiopian patients with whom I share a similar background because I grew up in Ethiopia. However, most of the time, I tend to a diverse patient population. In all cases, I start by introducing myself and asking about the patient's day to make them comfortable. Some patients are more anxious about their visit than others. For instance, I had a patient who was angry about what was going on in her life, her medical problems, and the healthcare team. Although I tried the same approach to talking to her, it did not seem to work, so I listened to her vent and asked what she wanted us to do to help. I learned that the best way to deal with emotional patients is by lending an open ear and expressing sympathy toward their issues while maintaining professionality. I continue to understand the family medicine practice and grow my skills within the medical field as I learn about various cultures.","Since graduating from Augustana College, I have gained more hands-on experience in the medical field while fulfilling my desire to serve my community. As an aspiring pediatrician, I moved on to work as an ABA behavioral therapist for kids with autism in the Somali community. My team members and I worked closely to devise and implement an individualized treatment plan for each child. During every session, we aimed to advance the potential of each child in mastering communication, social, and independent living skills. In addition, we organized group-based activities so the children could progress their teamwork skills. In time, I witnessed the children achieve numerous goals, and I was honored to be part of their development.

2023,14921412,,28,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"I am Latinx woman of Mexican descent and a first generation college graduate. My parents immigrated to the United States as teenagers and still speak primarily Spanish. My father acquired citizenship through a work amnesty granted by the US Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. My mother became a citizen through a marriage based petition in 2005.  Growing up, my parents worked in cleaning, maintenance and construction jobs so the household income was near or below the poverty line for extended periods of time. They worked paycheck to paycheck and took advantage of food stamps, school and hospital based financial assistance programs.

At the age of 11, I was accepted to Prep for Prep 9  - a ""leadership development program that offers promising students of color access to a private school education based in New York City"" https://www.prepforprep.org. I gained access to critical resources and mentorship.

My father would recount the misadventures of his bruises, cuts, and falls at the dinner table, always with a smile. One day in June, we got a desperate call: “Marco had an accident, his right hand - it’s bad this time.” At the hospital, I could barely recognize him. There was no twinkle in his eye, no attempt to weave a captivating story and ease our worry. An escalating discussion ping-ponged between my parents, the Spanish interpreters, and the medical team but I could only make out snippets: Nerve damage. We need to put him under. He’s diabetic. Easier to amputate. 

He shook his head firmly: “No.” 

A quick amputation would save him from a life of chronic pain, but he didn't see it that way. With that calloused hand, my father built sturdy homes, strummed his steel-string guitar, and pushed us too high on the swings. After much deliberation, the medical team strategized a more conservative surgery to restore as much function as possible. Following my father’s post-operative care, accompanying him to physical therapy and follow up appointments taught me how complicated bodies are, even at rest, and how they adapt ingeniously after trauma.  I will never forget that only with the support of his medical team, my father beat the odds.  Patient centered care means integrating a patient's values into the treatment plan and sometimes providing alternative solutions. 

Freshman year, in psychology class, I learned the term “phantom limb syndrome.” There was a brief case study on veteran amputees for our neuroscience unit. My mind flashed back to restless nights, my father’s grimacing face as he endured alternating hot and ice baths. Understanding the plasticity of the nervous system after trauma inspired a broader love of the life sciences. Learning the healing our bodies are capable of on a molecular level gave me hope that one day my father will live pain free. This curiosity lead me to pursue a neuroscience thesis project starting sophomore into my senior year. 

On one hand, my genetic rescue experiments on Drosophila were stepwise, elegant, and measurable contributions to our scientific body of knowledge – they had the potential to shed light on dopamine’s role in human movement. On the other hand, I needed to bring the rigor of research back to my community where the variables are not always so controlled.  

After college, I dove head first into the world of public health, of immigration justice and community based participatory research. Connecting the dots through immigrant justice health work has given me a more holistic understanding of medicine and it has been critical to my desire to be a physician. I learned that chronic disease, overwhelming medical bills, ER visits and a paralyzing distrust in the medical system are widespread symptoms of the health inequity experienced by low-income uninsured communities. 

As a community health coordinator, I helped to navigate Spanish speaking immigrants to accessible health care services. One day, I met a gentleman who had been released from the hospital earlier that week. He shared: “They said I have diabetes. I have to check my sugar every day but I don’t know how.” He had no support system and lived paycheck to paycheck. The wrinkled pamphlet they provided was in English. His diagnosis, although common, was life changing. Even taking a simple glucose test felt out of his control. 
I twisted and disassembled the lancing device: “Mi papá también tiene diabetes.” After years of taking my father’s glucose, it was muscle memory for me. I loaded the lancet, adjusting the knobs so that it would pierce his calloused fingertips and I explained: “It’s just like a drill with different levels, with practice - you can do this.” We pinpointed a safety net hospital and thought of questions he could ask during a follow up appointment. I assured him there were parts of his disease that could be controlled but I knew as a society, we could have intervened earlier. 

What if medical professionals were trained to anticipate the gaps and not exacerbate them? 

The ""promotora"" community health worker model recognizes that the wellbeing of individuals and their communities are inextricably linked. It puts into practice empathy, persistence, and troubleshooting as challenges arise. Embodying this approach in my nonprofit and research experiences has been a critical steppingstone in my decision to pursue medicine. I worked to formalize my skills in medical interpreting. Now, I recruit Spanish-speaking patients, women and other underrepresented minorities for cardiology clinical trials in NYU and Bellevue Hospital. The growing network of multilingual health providers and research projects excite me because we are building a future where everyone has access to exemplary care.

I want to practice medicine with a resilience that defies borders. I hope to learn more, contribute to global health initiatives of and be worthy of the trust patients give us. I will push others to advocate for our patients even when it seems impossible like my father's medical team. When physicians are attuned to the needs of the community, there is no limit to the care we can provide.","At the age of 11, I was accepted to Prep 9 - a leadership program for promising students of color in New York City. After fourteen months of preparation, I attended Deerfield Academy, an independent boarding school and later, Williams College in rural Massachusetts. The whiplash of attending well-resourced institutions as a low-income student of color taught me to be resilient in the face of adversity and also to genuinely listen in order to effectively collaborate with people vastly different from myself. I came back to Brooklyn excited to build people power through health access and activism. My clinical research experiences working with diverse patients also instilled a deep respect for ethics and for all people regardless of background. At Rush, I will collaborate and prove myself worthy of being a community physician. I will also use my academic privilege to promote health access in Chicago and to protect our most vulnerable patients while improving upon the standard of care.","During the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, I was involved in activism to secure economic relief for immigrant families in Brooklyn.  I drafted a proposal to secure $10,000 from the Brooklyn Community Foundation. At first I was excited but then, I realized we would have to distribute the funds. How were we supposed to determine who needed them the most when so many had lost their loved ones, jobs and homes? We created a google docs survey, a system to safely distribute $200 gift cards to 50 high-need families and even hand-wrote encouraging notes. Despite our efforts, it was not enough money and we received backlash on social media due to the lack of transparency. The situation was challenging but navigating it with a resilient team taught me the importance of taking baby steps in the face of demoralizing systemic injustice. Afterwards, we partnered with the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs to provide relief to families who were excluded in the first round of distributions.",,,1,"Conducting public health work during the pandemic taught me resilience, resourcefulness and the power that communities hold to overcome trauma.

At the time, I was involved in health disparities research and also working part-time as a community health coordinator. The pandemic exacerbated inequities for populations that already experienced higher comorbidities, poverty and barriers to care. I helped coordinate outreach, navigational services to funeral homes, economic relief grants, face masks, coronavirus tests and later vaccines.

We were supported by kind neighbors who looked after my brother and I, and summers with my grandma provided a secure childhood space. Due to their self-employment, we did not have funds for health insurance, and I have not had dental care. I am grateful for my school’s lunch program, which I applied for. I helped our small business, and my parents supported me with all they had, encouraging values of curiosity, hard work, and giving to others. Thus, I only noticed any lack of experiences or resources, such as travel, camps, or enrichment opportunities upon entering college. While I took advanced courses in high school, my high school peers and I were not prepared for the academic rigors of college, and we all struggled to pass introductory STEM courses. As our business struggled and we faced greater financial insecurity, I helped my family with food stamps.

Windows were glimpses into communities I fantasized for, but with a different turn today, I witnessed lines of tents, aching individuals, and wanted nothing more than to help. At 8 years old, my curiosity lingered on Skid Row. Clutching my biology textbook, fantasies turned into hopeful dreams to be a doctor.
Despite my dreams, I hardly went to see a doctor; uninsured, healthcare was a luxury. It was not until college that I appreciated medicine’s responsibility and explored my interests—helping live births and laughing with a baby’s first words after neurosurgery. The resilience of a child’s brain facilitating her life ahead was inspiring. I strived for more than glimpses into patient room windows, but to be a part of their journey.
Yet windows were never only a peek out to the world, but a peek into our home. As I appreciated medicine in its tangible moments, health began to personally feel further away.
For us, an hour of sleep meant one less hour of income, as I navigated food stamps at home. Asking my dad about hypertension medication, he’d reply, “No time, we’re just trying to make it day by day.” Eventually, he was in the ED for uncontrolled hypertension. These times amplified our place in the healthcare system and how social determinants shaped the health of families. From our lived experiences, I reflect on realities patients face and want to advocate realistic ways to manage health, when sometimes the priority is keeping a roof over our heads.
Recalling confusion and difficulty accessing care and cultural stigma barring us to seek help, I became director for a grassroots student group organizing free health fairs for under-resourced Asian American and Pacific Islander families, which provided culturally humble health resources we would’ve benefitted from. I learned how adequate primary care could prevent or manage chronic conditions of hypertension or diabetes, but how difficult it was to access due to larger systemic inequities and barriers, and I aim to further address realities of under-resourced AAPI families often overlooked.
To explore tackling health inequities in under-resourced communities beyond my own, I worked in South LA. As ED scribe, I witnessed further detrimental but preventable effects of inadequate primary care for chronic conditions, how environment affected health outcomes, and how ED was primary care. As care navigator, we connected patients to primary care and resources. In community-partnered research, the community directed the research. We developed a parent-peer intervention for minority families with children diagnosed with Autism, combating cultural and language barriers to navigate the special needs system and advocate for services. From this, I aim to partner with families in care, have continuous dialogue with cultural humility, stay grounded in my community, and empower patients with tools to manage their own health.
But in 2020, I suddenly moved out of urban LA to subrural Menifee. Helping care for my grandma’s end stages of Alzheimer’s reminded me how the science and fragility of medicine remained at the forefront, as we confronted her last days.
We’d change her diet based on stools and run oxygen tanks when she seized. Despite working in the ED, I didn’t know why oxygen helped or why she seized—were they TIAs or glucose? I desperately wanted to understand these mechanisms to better care for her.
Soon my aunt and I contemplated intubation and hospice care. Decisions are never black and white, as we grappled with quantity vs. quality of life for my loved one who raised me, and I aspire to support others in these decisions.  Moments highlighted how conditions never affect one person but all loved ones, how care was 24/7, and the many questions families have because they care.
While my grandma has since passed, I now treasure the privilege to coordinate novel gene therapies for infants with rare, neurodegenerative conditions. Their diagnostic odysseys alongside our experiences with providers motivate me to always listen first to families. While I appreciate relaying over family’s health questions, I strive to one day answer them.
Medicine allows peeks into others’ windows of vulnerability through a biological lens, in a sacred space often closed to others, but where real strength, connection, and change can begin as well.  I strive to be on the other side of windows I’ve passed, sit with patients as they gather strength amid uncertainty, and develop the expertise to guide families’ diagnoses through the lens of their experiences.
Though my reasons for medicine have taken many forms over time, every new experience has propelled my convictions.  It is hard to forget the uncertainty of our next dollar or grandma’s last day; like many patients I have met, my intersectional experiences drive my desire to further serve and uplift voices of vulnerable populations often under-resourced, overlooked, and marginalized by our complex healthcare system. From this, I aim to be a physician practicing community-partnered research, to work at the forefront of innovative programs and treatments for those most vulnerable, and compassionately advocate for just healthcare system.","Designing for a community Autism conference, I was invited to design for community conferences to address cancer disparities, working alongside community stakeholders, non-profit directors, and academic faculty members, participating in knowledge exchanges and developing community-partnered programs for the Black and Latino communities of South LA. _x000D_

We talked about a variety of things - their depression, experiences, and guilt for not meeting responsibilities. I reassured their efforts, validated their emotions, celebrated small wins, and offered support and plan together.

I rode past my local library, convinced that the “CLOSED FOR THE SUMMER” sign on the front door mocked my 4-mile commute to Barnes & Noble. Until her hospitalization, I simply thought Crohn’s disease meant my mom got stomach aches and we had to keep a roll of toilet paper handy everywhere we went. Seeing her body curled on the hospital bed left me both frustrated and confused – how could stomach aches suddenly cause such a strong woman to be so frail? Dissatisfied with my ignorance, I biked to Barnes & Noble to seek answers. As a single parent, my mom juggled multiple jobs, leaving her with little time to learn about her illness. As an immigrant, she avoided asking questions about her health, fearing that more time spent in a clinic would leave her vulnerable to deportation. At 13 years old, understanding Crohn’s disease was the only way I felt I could sincerely support my mom through her diagnosis.

When I returned from Barnes & Noble, I sat at my mom’s bedside eager to share the new notes I took that day. Texts such as, ""Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis – The Complete Practical Guide"", helped me explain how her symptoms were manifestations of different organs inflamed by Crohn’s disease. My drawing of the digestive system guided me as I gently felt her abdomen, estimating the location of each organ. To my delight, she began referencing my notes during medical appointments, helping her to develop a dialogue with her physician to better understand her health and make informed health decisions. Seeing how my ability to understand and communicate medical science expanded my mom’s health literacy gave me the confidence to advocate for the well-being of my community. My summer at Barnes & Noble was a microcosm of my greater purpose in pursuing medicine.

Without my familial exposure, I likely would not have taken the initiative to learn about Crohn’s disease nor known how to support my mom. Witnessing how my actions helped her take ownership of her health made me wonder how others in underserved communities navigated their chronic illnesses. I joined Dr. Giselle Petzinger’s lab as an undergraduate research assistant where I helped to promote physical activity among Spanish-speaking Hispanic women with neurological disorders. I recall speaking with a participant, “Lupe,” who stopped her evening walks in her neighborhood park due to safety concerns. Lupe drove to pick up her granddaughter from school and I suggested she try walking instead. During a follow-up conversation, she shared that not only had she incorporated walking into her daily life but that her mental well-being improved as well. The satisfaction I felt helping Lupe overcome a health-related barrier provided a similar sense of gratification to my experiences supporting my mom. However, in this instance, I played a direct role in Lupe's health by finding a solution to meet her physical activity goals. Through these experiences, my mission became clear: to collaborate with and empower individuals from underserved communities to take an active role in their health. My medical education will grant me the platform to fulfill my mission, while my personal and research experiences with health disparities will inform the care I provide.

Interested in expanding my patient interaction skills beyond the lab, I began volunteering at the emergency department where I met “Ana,” a Salvadoran woman with a severe lupus flare-up. I felt helpless covering her in a warm blanket as she was still deeply uncomfortable. I remembered a similar frustration of not being able to cure my mom during her Crohn’s flare-ups; however, this did not deter me from doing everything else in my power to put her at ease. I stayed with Ana until the attending physician arrived, trying to bring her solace. She complimented me on how long my hair was and joked about the hair she had lost since being diagnosed with lupus. “Mira, somos iguales” (Look, we’re the same) I said as I showed her a picture of my shaven head in high school when I donated my hair to Locks of Love. Her eyes widened with disbelief. I told her that if I could pull off the look, so could she. Ana laughed – while her visible relief helped curb some of my helplessness, I wanted my impact to go beyond just a human connection. I want to provide compassionate care while also being equipped with medical knowledge to heal patients like Ana. As a physician, I would be uniquely positioned to accomplish both.

I did not anticipate that my passion for medicine would be birthed that summer several years ago. The knowledge I discovered and shared with my mom eventually drew me to a field that would challenge me to take initiative in learning and critical thinking. My eagerness to not only learn but also listen to others unveiled my dedication to providing equitable healthcare for all. Throughout medical school and beyond, I hope to nurture the skills that have blossomed in me ever since I was a young girl spending my summer at Barnes & Noble.","Amber-colored leaves waved in the Hudson Valley breeze of my home for the next four years.

As part of the research team, it has been fulfilling and illuminating to work with disadvantaged patients like JC and offer community resources to serve their needs beyond the walls of the ED.

Behind their walls patients who are ill receive treatment by physicians who deeply care for their health and who are advocating for them even when they cannot for themselves. Being able to embody these tenets has always aligned with my values, however, due to my family’s circumstances, my desire to walk this path was overshadowed. We were Mexican immigrants who had no grasp of the English language, yet doctor’s offices were a place of refuge. There is where I realized that medicine is an art that goes beyond diagnoses and procedures, it encapsulates treatment through uplifting others. It translates scientific knowledge into compassionate and culturally competent care. It treats others so that they can achieve wellness through happier and healthier lives. This is what being a physician represents to me and why today, I want to become a doctor.

I vividly remember when my grandmother was diagnosed with diabetes. She complained of feeling tired, frequently urinating, and having a thirst she couldn’t quench. No one in my immediate family was in healthcare, thus it was difficult for us to understand what was happening to her. Soon after the onset of her symptoms, she was diagnosed with diabetes. After that I accompanied her to many doctor's visits, where I would gaze at the person in the white coat and wonder what it took to be like them—a natural-born gifted to heal, teach and put a mind at ease. I saw how loving and patient her doctors were with her despite her inability to speak English. And in these moments I came to know that medicine would allow me to connect with people further by bridging a language gap so many patients face.

Her latest doctor’s visit was in the ER after an episode of delirium. I was reminded of my time in the ED where we saw many patients who suffered from urosepsis. Often these patients also presented with delirium, and I realized there may be a connection to my grandmother’s condition. After a series of questions at the bedside, she admitted recent discomfort while using the restroom. I helped interpret her concerns along with this crucial piece of information, and it was at this point I knew she would be okay. Seeing the relief on my family's faces as the ER physician assured them she would recover emphasized the significance of earning someone's trust to care for their loved ones. Days later, she was discharged from the hospital after completing her IV antibiotics. Here I experienced firsthand the value of the family-physician relationship and the impact it can have on the course of treatment.

My interactions with medical staff would continue. One night I began to vomit blood, and my mother rushed me to the ER, where she tried to string sentences together in the best English that she could to communicate with the staff. Then and there it was not only my illness that weighed me down, but also seeing my teary-eyed mother struggle to talk with the staff, all while the possibility of her living her worst nightmare lingered in her mind. Today I think about all the questions she couldn't articulate and the anxiety behind each one, and I've vowed to one day be the kind of physician that addresses all his patients' concerns.

My friend's brother was diagnosed with kidney failure at eighteen. He had been vomiting for weeks until one day he felt so sick he walked himself to the hospital, where he would then start dialysis. I was shocked that such a disease could bring down a young person, a person like me. Learning about his brother helped me realize that medicine is not only for the older or chronically ill but also for the seemingly young and healthy. This experience shed light on utilizing medicine as a means to help people from all walks of life and to bring others back to wellness so that they can live their lives to the fullest potential, regardless of how much of their lives are left in front of them.

""Eva"" had missed her connecting flight, and the next one wouldn't depart until the morning. She was alone and without any money to buy food or pay for a hotel. She also mentioned she had diabetes. I knew I wouldn't leave her without food to get her through the night, so I found a nearly closing cafe where I bought her a cold turkey sandwich and an apple. I handed her the food, hoping it'd be enough to prevent her from becoming hypoglycemic. I wished her the best on her journey and left the airport teary-eyed. I was dismayed I was unable to help her more, further, I was disheartened that she suffered from an illness that is worsened by a lack of access to proper food and care. This reminded me of the underserved who often fall through the cracks, and how healthcare can fail to reach them. But I also realized that as a physician I could be in a unique position to help intervene by acting as a source of information and support for those at risk.

My journey through healthcare has taught me that being a physician also entails being an advocate, a teacher, a counselor, a coach, and very often, simply a listener because a healer wholeheartedly uplifts the human spirit. I attribute my sensibilities to these experiences as they have kept me grounded and have served as a reminder of what practicing medicine means to me: restoring hope.","My time volunteering has allowed me to work with people, for people, from all walks of life via various venues. From serving hot meals to next-door neighbors or refugees to assisting families in getting comfortable while waiting for a loved one who is undergoing a life-changing procedure, every individual interaction has been a unique opportunity to connect with someone unlike myself.

Today, these experiences have underscored that we are all the same at the most fundamental level; we all share similar hopes and dreams: hopes to live a healthy life with shelter and food at the table, hopes of well-being for those we love and care about so dearly, and dreams of being happy. By working with people with diverse stories, I have learned that we all stand upon more common ground than not.","My internship at the Lawndale Christian Health Center (LCHC) on Chicago's west side was a unique opportunity to impact the neighboring communities. At LCHC, I found that my impact on the patients we met took the form of providing health education. When seeing patients at the LCHC, I naturally gravitated toward the educational components of our visits because, to me, education is one of those gifts that keeps on giving, regardless of the form it might take. But health education, I believe, is integral to the betterment of any community, especially the underserved communities of our country. _x000D_

Over time, I grew into the role of Housing & Employment Officer, in which I talked with the community members to understand their circumstances and match their needs to available resources, such as warm meals and shelter provisions. This work exposed me to the fundamental problems associated with the stigmatization of homelessness and the lack of medical and general support services for low-income populations. Serving the unhoused community not only gave me a deep sense of fulfillment, but also presented me with a stark awareness of my own privilege. Now fitted with a yearning for a greater understanding of the medical healthcare system, I transitioned into urban medicine.
I earned my EMT license during my final semester of university, enabling me to continue to help those within my community while also allowing me to explore patient care and confirm that I wanted to practice medicine. It was a harrowing transition from providing housing services out of the local church to providing medical care in the back of an ambulance and inside of patients’ homes. Through the lens of my EMT license, I now saw the multifaceted burdens that disproportionately plagued impoverished communities, such as asthma and COPD exacerbations, uncontrolled diabetes, and missed appointments due to financial constraints. Yet, just as I had with my housing work, I could expand my knowledge and improve myself to provide the care that this patient population needed and deserved. I voraciously sought courses at my local medical educator and uncovered a personal fascination with both the science behind my care and how the intersection of my patients’ history and medications resulted in their medical emergencies. Exploring this blooming interest drove me towards extra opportunities for learning in classrooms, shadowing in operating rooms, and working in challenging patient-care environments. I transitioned from providing prehospital care to 911-response, to a high-volume emergency room setting at the San Francisco General Hospital. Eventually I developed the medical knowledge and experience to reinforce my passion and to position me to make a difference in hundreds of patients’ lives.
This was the case when an unconscious young man arrived at our hospital with a failing heart and no clear cause. His condition was difficult to manage, with six short-lasting resuscitations within the first hour. My team fixated on hypoxia as the root cause due to low trending oxygen saturation, but from previous experiences and my assessment of the case, I believed there might be more to the story. I immediately repositioned the probe and warmed the site with a hot pack, which increased blood flow and achieved an accurate reading near one hundred percent. While the patient initially improved, their palpable pressure soon declined so I stressed the need for epinephrine. I swiftly alerted our attending physician who supported my suggestion. Following that medication administration and continued treatment, the patient stabilized and later recovered with zero neurological deficits. I felt immensely fulfilled in that moment; my medical knowledge, medical experiences, and personal empathy enabled someone else to live another day.
After university and my involvement with The Suitcase Clinic, I continued to pursue opportunities to become a more learned medical provider while maintaining my dedication to working with underserved communities. I believe that medical school will help me develop the knowledge and skills which I can use to help uplift these communities in the future. My experiences both inside and outside of the emergency room have helped me build the emotional resilience needed for this career path, while also giving me a taste of what it feels like to take part in a miracle. Some days I take part in the saving of a life, and others I witness the ending of one. I will carry all of these experiences with me as zeal, compassion, and composure while I go along my journey to flower into the best provider and person I can be.","As a volunteer with The Suitcase Clinic, a student-led organization that helped the unhoused community of Berkeley, California, I worked with people from vastly different backgrounds from my own and saw firsthand the impact of poor social determinants of health. To understand our clients‚Äô needs, I would listen to their stories and ensure that they felt heard, respected, and welcome in our clinic space. Through them, I learned how systemic barriers kept generations in cycles of poverty and how for many of them, the growing stress from insecure housing, financial burden, and poor health education contributed to their chronic health problems. While I could not treat our clients‚Äô medical concerns as an undergraduate volunteer, I was able to secure them places to stay, resolving one root cause of their health problems. Being able to address the social determinants of a community‚Äôs health was deeply fulfilling and motivated me to work with historically disadvantaged communities as an EMT.","In April 2020, Rock Medicine partnered with the newly erected COVID-19 Field Care Clinic and I took the opportunity to serve the under-resourced neighborhood of Bayview, San Francisco. I quickly became a familiar face around the clinic as a consistent volunteer, so I could pinpoint the challenges that we struggled with. I proactively redesigned our testing and treatment sites to reduce the likelihood of patient exposure and documented volunteer responsibilities as our staff grew. I also helped actualize our medical director‚Äôs ideas, such as architecting a curbside treatment area for immunocompromised patients. Despite my title as a volunteer EMT, I filled out the gaps where I felt leadership was needed and helped turn our scrappy clinic into a powerhouse for improving the health of this neighborhood. My experience improving care accessibility and care quality for this community helped shape my desire to become a physician devoted to uplifting community health.",,,1,"In Spring 2020, alongside my work at Eagle Ambulance and volunteering at the COVID-19 Field Care Clinic, I worked towards a phlebotomy certification that would help me transition into a clinical EMT position within an emergency room (ER). Unfortunately, the pandemic changed my plans; my hospital externship was delayed and my housemate moved out due to my high exposure risk. Faced with rent I could no longer afford, I moved into my mother‚Äôs house and took a temporary position closer to home as a 911-response EMT at Falck while I finished my externship and earned my phlebotomy license. After two months of providing high acuity patient care, I transitioned into my current position at San Francisco General Hospital‚Äôs ER. While I regret only having the opportunity to work at Eagle and Falck for two months each, I learned to adapt to the unforeseen and, in doing so, gained valuable clinical experience and a greater understanding of the physician‚Äôs role in acute care.",1,0,2

When I was nine years old singing in Sulley and dreaming of the future, I never imagined that my unconventional interests would lead me to medical school. My road map to medicine consisted of an engineering degree, minors in music and Southeast Asian studies, and the blood of at least 300 fruit flies dissected in Shanghai in the name of science. Combined with my experience as a chaplain and biophysics research assistant, some may question how medicine interests me at all. Medicine is the missing link in each field I explored. I enjoyed the teamwork and problem-solving of engineering but craved a real connection with the patients I was designing for. I loved caring for people’s emotional needs as a chaplain but missed engaging with science. Human health is influenced by more than just chemical reactions; culture, disposition, and systemic factors all influence an individual’s health. My eclectic educational route equips me to provide an interdisciplinary approach to medicine.

I rolled into my junior year in a not-so-new set of wheels and quickly learned that some of my best problem-solving would happen in my minivan. After spending hours fruitlessly brainstorming, my senior design team hopped in Sulley for a break and some bubble tea. Interestingly, drinking bubble tea in Sulley reminded me of bonding over boba with migrant farm workers I met while shadowing doctors in Southeast Asia. Many of them suffered from chronic knee pain; and few affordable, effective, and flexible solutions existed. As we considered possible treatments, the makeshift recording studio I built in my van led me to consider therapeutic ultrasound. My experience building microphones in music class guided me as I designed the ultrasound circuit in the knee brace. My design project acted as an important pitstop by showing me how my wide range of expertise fueled innovation. Each person has a complex background; I want to combine my strong scientific foundation and personal creativity to address the healthcare needs of each individual.

Practicing medicine allows me to guide people through adversity. After graduating, I served as a chaplain through the organization Cru to counsel Cornell students during the pandemic. Little did I know that the pandemic would hinder my ability to be on campus, and counseling would occur while driving Sulley. Because I drove a soccer-mom minivan, many students would ask for a ride to the airport or grocery store. Eventually, my free Uber service morphed into a moving chaplaincy. People who didn’t have a destination but needed someone to talk to would hop in the van. Some days, I spent five hours driving aimlessly listening to my passenger’s story. By the end of our miniature road trip, people would express their gratitude and renewed hope. I discovered how my simple ability to drive and listen provided a safe place to be vulnerable. I want to use my unique skills to care for others through an intimate part of life: health.

Many of those minivan conversations were difficult. When I picked up Mannayah from her dorm, I didn’t expect to sit in a parking lot for two hours mourning her friend’s suicide with her. It reminded me of my junior spring semester when I drove home after my cousin’s funeral wondering how I was going to move on from her suicide. Around that time, I battled unexplained health issues, and loss seemed to define my life. As I struggled to believe I was more than my sickness, my physicians relentlessly fought for answers and reaffirmed my inherent dignity. The experience encouraged me to be a physician so I can protect quality of life because we are not defined by what we’ve lost. My cousin’s death is one of six in my family in the past six years. So along with being a patient, I’ve been the support system—one of the many wringing their hands in the hospice and nervously calling the ICU. When I shadowed Dr. Duncan, a surgical oncologist, a desperate family traveled across the country for his surgical expertise. He not only provided physical care but was a source of strength for the patient’s family. One of the biggest reasons I want to be a doctor is to prevent loss and suffering for both patients and their support systems.

Contrary to Rascal Flatts’ hit song, life was not a highway for me after college. Life has been driving through downtown Baltimore catching every red light and inching towards my next destination: medical school. After Sulley was towed on my second day of work, I knew that Baltimore's city, culture, and parallel parking would be very different from my suburban childhood. Trauma research—my penultimate stop—combines scientific inquiry with my desire to walk with patients, yet I feel frustrated that I can’t treat their injuries or provide answers to their health concerns. I want to truly practice and apply medicine. When I drive to work, I sometimes think of how I want my career in medicine to be like my minivan—an embodiment of scientific theory used for diverse applications, a safe space to be heard and supported, and a vehicle of change creatively used to serve people from all walks of life.","In January 2019, I joined the executive board of Community Faith Partners, a service-oriented organization. After the murder of George Floyd, we created an online seminar series, where BIPOC people could share their stories and educate on racial injustice. Their experiences made me aware of the long-lasting consequences of injustice and inequality. After seeing a change in our small community, I pursued my current position to better understand injustice in the medical field. Born to a nurse in the suburbs of Indiana, I didn‚Äôt face obstacles to health care like my patients, who are primarily from low-income areas in Baltimore. Because our patients expressed difficulty receiving care and information on their brain injuries, I started a quarterly newsletter with research and guidance on recovery. I am beginning to explore patient advocacy from a research perspective, and as a medical student, I want to learn how to educate patients on policies and health risks relevant to their community.","Each Saturday, after volunteering at Second Wind, I would drive back to Cornell‚Äôs beautiful campus on the next hill over. With each mile, I‚Äôd feel more disconnected from the community I served. The men and families living in the houses I helped to build were strangers to me, until I made efforts to eat, hang out, and do life with them in my later years of college. Installing insulation and painting walls was worthwhile, yet playing board games and celebrating Thanksgiving was equally important. As a junior, I coordinated Care Day, a service event with multiple work sites across Tompkins County. With the help of families from Second Wind, we laid hay, cooked meals, and cleaned homes for other people living in Tompkins County. Community service took a new meaning for me and the community of Second Wind: we were equipping our community to serve our community. Care Day continues to occur biannually with the volunteer force growing yearly.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic began midway through my senior year of college. I received the Sterry Career Research Award during the summer of 2019, which would have culminated in a poster and presentation at the Engineering Learning Initiatives Undergraduate Research Poster Session in April 2020. Unfortunately, the event was canceled, and I was unable to present my work, ‚ÄúDevelopment of a new optical tool for studying chromatin conformation and gene regulation."" Additionally, during the summer and fall of 2020, I planned to volunteer at Cayuga Medical Center, which I had previously done in 2017. Because the hospital restricted visitors to protect patients, I volunteered at a community kitchen, Loaves & Fishes, and continued to serve as secretary of Community Faith Partners.",1,1,2

The commotion of the airport and the idea of flying across the world gave me a sense of connectedness, a feeling in which I found comfort, even as I left my own home in North Carolina to fly to China to visit my uncle. It was no secret that my uncle was my favorite. Growing up, I was always the loud, talkative one in the family. My uncle, who never missed a beat in making our family laugh, mirrored my very essence in the form of a 44-year-old Chinese man. It was through my time with him at his most vulnerable that I first became in tune with my passion for serving others and put me on the path to medicine. 

At the start of my freshman year, my uncle was diagnosed with stage 3 liver cancer. Regardless of how busy I was, I made sure to FaceTime him several times a week. During those calls, I would tell him stories about school or work, pausing to listen to his dreadful jokes. Over time, I sensed my uncle’s energy dissipating. As I heard less of his own wit, I infused more of mine, doing my best to make him laugh. I felt so much joy and fulfillment from seeing his smile and by reciprocating the lifelong kindness he had shown me until the very end. As I coped with the loss of my uncle, I reflected on the many oncologists and nurses that were unwavering throughout his treatment; how they eased his pain through a balance of expertise, compassion, and the staunch commitment to his daily care. These physicians treated medicine as a means to not only treat a patient’s illness, but also champion an experience of mutual support and trust at a time when the patients needed it most. I know this meant the world to my uncle, and from then on, I set out to find a career that would enable me to reciprocate their strength, insight, dedication, and resilience.

I knew there were many paths that would enable me to have a similar impact on people’s lives. While studying at UNC, I was exposed to the ceaseless demand and variability within medicine during my time with Timmy Global Health (TGH). Through TGH’s international healthcare programs, I traveled to 11 rural towns in Ecuador to assist physicians and nurses in local clinics. Alongside the lead attending, Dr. S, I saw over 20 patients per day from sunrise to sundown. I quickly learned that all I had been taught in public policy classes about healthcare equity and clean water access was but a small element of the reality. No matter the case, Dr. S took the time to understand her patients, alleviating them of their concerns by internalizing their questions and providing thoughtful answers. Time and time again, I saw her actively listen to mothers with sick children, sons with ill fathers, and siblings with no one but each other. Her thoughtfulness was heroic to me and left me to wonder what drives her to return to Ecuador every year. I came to realize that Dr. S was passionate about global health, not just global medicine. Dr. S worked with her patients to educate them on diet, clean water and more, not just to solve the case but to improve their long-term health outcomes. My experiences in Ecuador taught me that medicine is not just about diagnosing the patient; it is also about empowering the patient with the knowledge necessary to improve their health long after they’ve been discharged. This illuminated the importance of academic medicine and led me to the field of clinical research.

As a Clinical Research Coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), I began to cultivate the same passion that I witnessed in so many physicians and experienced firsthand how research is the driving force behind the advanced level of medicine I wanted to provide. In particular, one patient I worked with faced a difficult journey and the daunting prognosis of colorectal cancer with metastasis to the liver. Dr. W made clear to me that the majority of his patients have a short lifespan depending on the stage of diagnosis, so because of the nature of his specialty all he can do is his best. His research focuses on improving dosimetry and response following treatment, and it is particularly exciting to be a part of research that will have a direct impact on not just this one patient, but also on the improved clinical protocols used by other healthcare professionals.

Since my uncle’s death, I’ve looked to medicine as the path to find fulfillment in my career, accumulating many lessons along the way. My time with my uncle taught me how to find strength in times of loss; volunteering with TGH taught me how to take a holistic view of a patient’s life; working at MGH has made clear the role that clinical research plays in elevating the quality of health care. This strength, insight, and dedication is supported by a fierce resilience developed through my own personal experiences. Now, I am eager to integrate these lessons and dedicate myself to the craft of providing outstanding patient care. Although flying still gives me the same sense of connectedness that I felt as a child, I’ve realized that the sense of fulfillment upon landing to see my uncle will only come with a career in medicine as an adult.","As a volunteer, I traveled with clinical teams to underserved communities in Ecuador to provide medical care. On one particular clinic visit, I had the opportunity to chat with a young eight year old girl who was brought in for a fever and cough. We spent the visit connecting on her interest in reading, drawing, and our shared bond of having a younger brother. What my experience with this young girl made clear to me is how people are more similar than they are different, no matter where I go. While from different countries and life circumstances, we shared strong common bonds of mutual experiences. While medical expertise is a must, I believe it will be my ability to connect with patients‚Äô experience and life perspective that can help enable better health outcomes. Above all, a physician must be able to empathize with their patient‚Äôs emotions and understand their perceptions, and be able to use those help empower them.","At Boston Medical Center (BMC), an institution that is similarly an anchor within its community, I helped facilitate the process of cardiac non-stress testing by preparing each bed and escorting each patient. One patient I assisted was apprehensive as it was her first time at BMC. To provide some support, I checked up on her frequently and brought extra pillows for her comfort. When the test was completed, she smiled and whispered ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. A simple gesture, but it made me proud. I realized how valuable the ‚Äúlittle things‚Äù are and that bringing something as simple as a pillow or just being there are small things that have a huge impact on a patient. I also recognized how parts of the patient experience contribute to the healing process. I find these little interactions motivating and energizing, reminders of the passion and interest that initially launched me into the path of medicine. ",,,1,"During the pandemic, I was redeployed to double-shifts assisting mask distribution for Massachusetts General Hospital. I am thankful for this opportunity to be a part of a team that indirectly helped patients receive care during these challenging times. I saw what being a healthcare professional meant - collaboration, support, and dedication is what comprises the community that is the healthcare system. Having the opportunity to interact with patients and providers during my pandemic assignments also revealed to me the inequality in healthcare. I learned that many communities near Boston had limited access to COVID testing compared to others. Moreover, many patients suffered delays in seeking needed care, especially among the underserved population. As a prospective medical student, I intend to help address medical access and equity by participating in programs or student organizations that focus on vulnerable patient groups, such as Heart to Soles and the Community Health Clinic.",1,1,1

My first cousin has TAR syndrome, a congenital birth defect. My mom and I both have autoimmune diseases - she has alopecia and I have celiac. My dad has spent much of his adult life battling an alcohol addiction. Following a car accident, my grandfather lived the rest of his life in chronic pain and with a failing heart. 

As a young adult, I deeply appreciate how each family member has influenced me and my motivation for medicine. All have faced at various times intense social stigma. My grandfather - Opa as we call him - had to quit work in the prime of his life for an invisible injury. My cousin’s very obvious physical disability has led people to assume more about what he cannot do than what he can. My dad’s journey to recovery proves he is so much more than his addiction, and my mom staring down age-old definitions of beauty is honest and brave.

All of us have had excellent healthcare providers and good insurance benefits. I acknowledge that not everyone has the same access to medical care. As much as it was the compassion and skill of individual doctors, it was also the community resources, financial stability, and absence of systemic biases that gave me the chance to have the family that I do.

I am my Opa’s grandchild, and I know the weight of that statement because of the years I was given with him. He passed away in January, just shy of 24 years since a complicated open heart surgery, which coincidentally took place on my first birthday. My Opa’s wisdom, love and example of resilience in the face of chronic pain helped us all. Had he not recovered after his car accident, or heart surgery, how might that have changed how the rest of us faced our own struggles? When I think about ‘why medicine’, my family is always close to my mind. Everyone deserves to be seen as more than their diagnosis. It’s not the status or prestige that draws me towards being a doctor; it’s the chance to heal. 

This is not my first time applying to medical school; in fact, it is my third. Throughout my previous cycles I felt a lot of self-imposed pressure, and when the rejections came, they hit hard. In those tough times I found that I had a depth of resilience to draw on - a product of the resilience I have seen emulated in my family my entire life. I finally stopped trying to force some idealized plan.

Over the past three years I’ve affirmed that I have the attributes, talents and motivation to be a strong medical student and doctor. I spent three years as an undergraduate in a neurosurgery research lab. I mastered surgical procedures and built skills needed to approach longitudinal objectives. I loved being a valued member of a team all working towards a common goal. Collaboration, community and a shared love of learning are things I want to foster and experience in my medical career.

After graduation, I worked as an assistant for the emergency department, which provided an unvarnished view into the successes and difficulties that doctors face. One of the most impactful parts of this job was witnessing support and collaboration play out across medical and academic settings. I experienced it myself, especially when the Vice Chair of Education mentored me in support of my goal to go to medical school. I also got to work with her and two other women to form the UW Group on Women in Medicine and Science, a forum for women doctors and scientists to collaborate, find peer mentors, and share lessons with each other. Success doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and being a doctor includes accepting help from others in order to give the best to your patients. 

These experiences prepared me for my current role as a research coordinator in the ER. I engage with patients who are scared, uncertain, uncomfortable, and often in pain – and find ways to connect with them while conducting valuable research. Working directly with patients has honed my skills, especially building rapport and increasing my comfort with uncertainty. The connection that I get to make with a wide variety of patients – from ten-month olds in an asthma study to octogenarians taking part in pneumonia research – has reinforced that keeping the humanistic aspect of medicine center of mind is critical. This role has also exposed me to the inequities that different communities face and the way that exacerbates the health and treatment of individuals. Through these various perspectives – research, medical education, administration, and patient care – I’ll be entering medical school with an unfiltered view of the way the medical world operates, how I can use my skills to impact and change that world for the better, and a strong confirmation that this is where I want to be. 

The core tenets that guide my life – strength, family, and resilience – will help me to excel in medicine, a field I have repeatedly chosen to pursue, despite the difficulties I know lie ahead. I’ve put in the work to ensure that I know why I want to be here, and what I am getting into. I’ve had the chances to bow out and move on, but I have proven to myself that I have what it takes to be a compassionate, dedicated, curious, informed, and empathetic doctor.","While in the ER I was recruiting for a substance misuse screening tool study. After talking to one patient, he asked: ‚ÄúAre you asking everyone, or just us Black folks?‚Äù I had not recognized how this interaction must have seemed to him. I knew the wide eligibility pool, while he saw a white woman asking sensitive questions to a member of a population historically stigmatized for drug use. This interaction spurred me to start a conversation amongst my team and create a more equitable and informed framework factoring in the implications of research and whose narrative it strengthens. This has included working with study teams to change the ‚Äòpitch‚Äô of studies to be more clear and patient centered, as well as learning to assess potential barriers and biases that we carry or may be perceived by patients, particularly around the studies in our portfolio that focus on more stigmatized medical diagnoses or societal issues.","During my time as the president of the mountaineering club I notably changed the culture of inclusion, specifically related to women holding leadership roles. When I first joined, I was one of only two women who held active leadership roles in a club of over 100 people. As president I had the ability to enact long-lasting change in a manner that I had not been able to through individual mentorship. I applied for university grants on behalf of the club to subsidize leader training, fought for and gained increased funding, and expanded the pipeline of programs for new and veteran leaders. I ran a women‚Äôs film festival and used the profits to create a club scholarship fund for women in leadership training. In the years since graduating I have stayed on as a community member and continually see the lasting impact that my efforts have had. Now, there is about an even number of women and nonbinary folks in leadership positions as compared to men.",,,1,"During the pandemic, I continued working in the medical field, first in a hybrid model and then onsite in the emergency room. Both models required creativity and resilience, and accelerated my professional development in ways I could not have expected. While on the medical education team, I supported students through virtual learning, remote residency interviews, and canceled clerkships. Working in the ER, I saw how typical barriers to care were exacerbated. The isolation of the pandemic led some people to delay care, while others ended up in the ER for chronic conditions that they were unable to manage on their own. This changed the type and severity of care needed, and required a holistic understanding of our patients‚Äô situations when interacting with them. Through the pandemic, I have developed creative solutions, greater empathy, and improved patient skills that will benefit me as I pursue my medical career.",1,0,2

An opportunity to offer support to underserved youth in my local community arose, which allowed me to work with children and adolescents at the Minneapolis American Indian Center. This experience enabled me to understand how even the smallest of interventions can have a profound influence on the trajectory of human health.

While volunteering, I discovered the power of building relationships quickly and its capacity to impact impressionable youth positively. One day, I was walking by a student's laptop when something caught my eye. I looked over and my heart dropped when I saw the search bar read ""guns for sale."" My mind jumped to all of the different potential outcomes of this search and I felt an overwhelming sense of fear. However, instead of shutting the child's laptop and following up immediately with a lecture about the dangers of guns, I decided calmly to sit down next to the child and have a conversation to get more information about the situation. After a brief discussion, I learned that the child did not feel safe walking alone to school from home and felt the need to find a means of protection. We assessed alternative transportation methods and how to identify and obtain available school resources. We also discussed the potential consequences of taking different actions and weighed the benefits and costs of different scenarios together. By the end of our conversation, the student came to the conclusion that a gun is not the best method for protection and stopped researching guns. I notified the program head about what had happened, and while they expressed concern, they were appreciative regarding the way I handled the situation.

This encounter did not occur in a medical setting, but it did involve a conversation that reflected some of the core values and strengths that I will bring to my work as a future physician. My open-minded attitude, natural curiosity, and interpersonal skills were essential to finding the most effective solution. Creating and maintaining trust in my relationship with this child is something I will continue to do with patients. The process of identifying issues early on and creating a follow-up plan draws me toward becoming a physician.

During the past couple of years, my experience providing care to patients at an academic medical center has solidified my desire to become a physician. When assigned to a patient who recently developed auditory hallucinations that presented in the form of hearing people's voices in a hidradenitis suppurativa-specific visit, I approached the situation with compassion and took a nonjudgmental stance. The patient was originally resistant to seeking psychiatric help. However, by the end of our 15-minute clinical history conversation, I earned a measure of their trust that enabled them to seek psychiatric help. In a different clinic I served as a clinical artificial intelligence photographer and data interpreter. One hair loss patient I worked with suffered from terminal illness and major depression. When the patient entered the photography room, there were no traces of hope or happiness on their face. In that moment, I wanted to do anything in my power to lessen their burden, even if for just a short period of time. While taking photographs, I asked them to tell me about things they enjoyed. Gradually, they became animated and smiled as they told me about their favorite show on Animal Planet. Even though their face returned to its original expression when the attending and resident rejoined us, the knowledge that I had brought happiness to the patient during our time together reaffirmed my decision to pursue a life in the field of medicine. Rejoicing in the small effects that I have already had on people's lives in the clinical setting brings me hope that I can have a wider impact as a future physician. This hope makes me more dedicated and determined to succeed in medical school. My will to ""repair the world"" is strong; when difficult situations arise, I want to be there for those around me and find the best solutions to meet individual needs. 

Repairing the world requires filling in the gaps. There are gaps and tears in the fabric of medicine in the United States today, and underserved populations are some of the first to feel the rip of the seams. I am one person with one needle who wants to engage in the work of mending and hope to do so in the field of medicine.","In college, I volunteered at a local elementary school where I mentored my first-grade buddy. My buddy was polite, funny, and smart, however, he received regular punishment where he was unable to go outside for recess. The group of students with this punishment was disproportionately Black. I inquired further, and the gym teacher told me that there would be no opportunities for re-evaluation in the near future. I advocated for my buddy and asked for a sooner re-evaluation date, and when all else failed, offered to accompany him to recess. They agreed. This situation taught me about how difficult it is for young Black students to succeed when their peers, teachers, and school system are not supporting them. As a medical student and future physician, I will consider the impact of systemic racism on Black patients' overall health and wellbeing. Furthermore, I will make compassion, respect, and a willingness to engage in regular self-assessment a priority.","For the past year, I have had the privilege of volunteering at the Minneapolis American Indian Center‚Äôs (MAIC) Golden Eagle after-school program. Golden Eagles provides a safe space for Native Americans and other underserved children and adolescents. I enjoy building relationships with these children and offering them additional support. When a boy in our program opened up to me about how he was teaching himself to play the piano, was upset that his keyboard had stopped working, and was unable to afford a new one, I made it my mission to find him a replacement so he could continue to pursue his passion. In addition, this past July, I partnered with GAP Inc. and Old Navy to coordinate the donation of hundreds of new clothing items to Haven Housing, a local women and children‚Äôs shelter, and the MAIC. I believe that supporting my local community in these ways has better prepared me to care for underserved populations and my community as a medical student and future physician.",,,1,"While I was originally planning on applying to medical school with one gap year, my plans changed due to the need for me to care for my grandmother during the early pandemic. Unfortunately, this situation prompted the cancellation and deferral of my scheduled MCAT. However, these unexpected changes turned out to be blessings in disguise because they led to an incredibly rewarding clinical research experience that allowed me to discover my passion for research and patient care. As a clinical research fellow, I helped provide direct patient care when patients started to come back to in-person clinics. During this time, medical students had not yet integrated into the clinical setting and I had to learn quickly how to scribe and take patient histories remotely and in-person. I believe that my transition into the healthcare field during this particularly turbulent time has increased my ability to adapt and be resilient in the face of obstacles within the field of medicine.",1,0,2

“Cómo Nana? No veo un vaso.” (How Nana? I don’t see a cup.)
“Con la esponja.” (With the sponge.)
 
I was 15 years old when I heard the word “hospice” for the first time. I discovered this meant my Tata (grandfather) would never hold a cup or drink on his own again. That day he laid before me, deflated, unable to speak, sit up, or move his head. He was not the man I knew, whose arms I would run into when he came home, who patched up drywall when I roller-skated inside the house, and played guitar for his family. A shadow of the man I knew and loved now lay before me. More than anything, I wanted to press the damp sponge gently on the leathery lips of the man who raised me. I wanted to do anything that could bring him the tiniest bit of relief. But I couldn’t. I was scared. I always wanted to be a doctor, but after seeing the rock of our family die before my eyes, I wasn’t sure. I needed to uncover if there was more to medicine.
 
Moving forward, I never wanted fear to outweigh my desire to help someone ever again. I vowed to conquer the experiences that scared me. One such experience found me early in my undergraduate career. I applied for a program called Data+ where I worked on a project called “Social Determinants of Health” (SDOH) that included ten, 40-hour weeks of pure, grueling bliss. As my team worked tirelessly to develop an interactive map of resources connected to SDOH in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, my world expanded. I not only learned an entirely new coding language, but I also realized that the world was not what I thought. Before Data+, I never knew that a zip code was so closely related to a community’s average lifespan. How could it be that within a county, the concentration of vape shops and convenience stores compared to Starbucks’ locations and yoga studios correlated to race, education, income, and health outcomes? What started out as a hesitant step outside my comfort zone, turned into a passion.
 
I delved further into this world when I was accepted into an interdisciplinary research program called Bass Connections on a project team called “SALUD: Scholar Academy for Latinxs United for Diversity”. Its purpose is to expand Latinx representation in STEM and healthcare careers through a curriculum designed for local Latinx high schoolers. Through this program, I explored health through the lens of my community, while helping others do the same. During one session, we watched a video about an undocumented Salvadoran woman living in Durham who struggled to pay for insulin. One of my students' eyes lit up, “That’s my tía (aunt).” What ensued was a rich conversation within my small group about what it meant to need medical care in the United States as a Latinx patient. The discussion transitioned to solutions regarding how to ensure that everyone’s “tías” get the care they need and deserve.
 
The interplay of these two experiences enhanced my interest in SDOH while allowing me to explore how data analysis is used to enact change. At El Futuro, a local Latinx mental health community center, we watched a documentary called “Resilience” centered on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). A physician in the documentary created a community center through her practice and researches the effects of ACEs, while integrating data and medicine to improve health outcomes in the lives of children who have experienced a high number of ACEs. I watched in awe as I saw my dreams lived out before me and realized what a privilege/honor it is to be a physician: to be a pillar of the community, to have the ability to conduct life-changing research, to have the authority to implement it, and most importantly, to use this to improve the quality of life for patients.
 
Around the same time, I enrolled in a course called Death and Dying that involved service-learning. When selecting a site, I chose to volunteer at the Hock Family Pavilion, a hospice facility. I recognized the time had come for me to confront my fears regarding hospice care. Through my experiences, I met many families who reminded me of my own and I sat by the beds of many families' Tatas. As I did, I couldn’t help but picture my own Tata, although now I was finally able to find the healing and closure I wasn’t ready to face at 15 years old. My understanding and perception of hospice shifted; it was no longer a time when people give up and die. Rather, it was where people find comfort and peace in their final moments.
 
Death no longer looms over me as a fearsome, ever-present enemy. My goal as a person and future physician is no longer to beat Death. My focus has shifted to the living. I strive to do what I can now, and I hope to provide culturally competent care to improve the quality of life of those around me. Some days that might be data analysis, other days it could be participating as a speaker in a program like SALUD, or even sitting at the bedside of a dying patient offering words of comfort. Being a physician will require overcoming many obstacles and fears, but I will embrace these challenges. If there’s anything my experiences have taught me, it’s that every scary moment is an opportunity for growth.","When I volunteered at a nursing and rehabilitation facility, I interacted with a resident who I'll call James. James is a permanent resident and generally pretty soft-spoken. The first time I met him, we asked each other what it was like growing up since he's lived his whole life in North Carolina and I grew up in Arizona. I left that day looking forward to continuing to build our friendship. When I returned the next week, James had forgotten who I was and our previous conversation. Once more, James recounted the beauty of the rolling hills and North Carolina skies, and it was just as vivid as the first time. Understanding that James would likely not remember me the next time we visited, I created a plan so that we could engage in other activities if he didn't feel like talking. To my surprise, it worked. We watched sports on the iPad or read the Bible. Spending time with James showed me how to form a different kind of connection brought about through creativity.","One of the motivations behind all that I do is the notion of giving back what I've gained. Two of my extracurricular experiences emphasize this value, my time as part of the SALUD program, and becoming a LEAPS facilitator for the Death and Dying course. I joined SALUD to provide an example for Latinx high schoolers interested in STEM or healthcare and help them in their journey. I discussed the realities of college and pursuing STEM as an underrepresented minority. In the end, I helped my students apply to summer programs and colleges. I'd like to think my guidance has played a small role in their lives. On the other hand, I became a facilitator for Death and Dying to assist my peers. Having gone through the heavy topics and service-learning placements changed me and how I view the world. If even a single student gained something from hearing my own experiences or through the small group discussions I ran, then I consider the world changed.",,,1,"Due to COVID-19, I could not continue some of my in-person clinical volunteering activities at the Durham Nursing and Rehabilitation Center and the Hock Family Pavilion. Due to personal living situations, I did not pursue clinical experiences until a vaccine was available. After moving cities, delta and omicron variants have limited new opportunities. To continue engaging, I have taken advantage of online resources such as virtual shadowing to gain further exposure to different specialties. At home, I‚Äôve had multiple family members die, the closest being my godfather who is one of my inspirations for becoming a physician as he was the director of the local hospital in Mexico where my family is from. The circumstances brought on by the pandemic are challenging but have taught me to treasure moments with family more than before and has shown me what I would be missing without clinical care as a part of my life, reaffirming my desire to get back to it.",1,0,2
2023,14963665,,25,Man,USA,0,,1,1,"I grew up in a suburb of Bello, Colombia. I lived a happy childhood and was fortunate to have good health. In 2012, my mom and I moved to the United States, looking for better educational opportunities. We enjoyed financial stability, though it only lasted a few years. My mom got laid off from her job and simultaneously divorced my ex-stepfather. We lived in the living room of my aunt’s already crowded apartment until my mom and I could rent a small apartment. Both of us sacrificed our sleep and health to afford it. My mom worked as much overtime as she could, and I worked between 20 and 30 hours per week during my junior and senior years of high school. Through college, I lived with financial distress and doubted that I would belong in the medical field due to my background. In addition, only 0.6% of my community has achieved a professional degree, ranking my city as the least educated in my state. Nevertheless, I think of all the hardship my mom and I have gone through.

We met with Dr. Dob, a neurosurgeon. We felt chills running through our bodies as Dr. Dob gave the devastating news: a brain tumor. To have the best chance at recovery, we decided to proceed with surgical removal. Seconds felt like hours during the surgery as I sat in the hospital’s lobby desperately waiting. Eventually, Dr. Dob called us with the good news: The procedure was successful. The hospital’s Neurology Department became our temporary home for a few weeks while she recovered her strength, speech, and sight. Physicians checked on her every day, diligently arranged the plan for her recovery, and prepared us for our roles in it. Even on days when Dayana was at her weakest, Dr. Dob always appeared optimistic while still realistic. He lifted our spirits and always let us know that Dayana was recovering as expected despite the occasional trying moments. Eventually, Dayana made a full recovery, and her life progressively returned to normal. This event in 2017 motivated me to explore medicine, hoping to be as capable as Dr. Dob, who, through his knowledge and positive demeanor, saved Dayana’s life and made this challenging period easier to overcome. 

Combining my interest in medicine with my Hispanic heritage, I became a Spanish medical interpreter at the Rhode Island Free Clinic (RIFC). One day, I interpreted for “Maria,” a middle-aged woman with diabetes who had an abnormally high blood sugar level. Quietly shaking her head, her eyes focused on the floor, Maria seemed hesitant to follow Dr. Larkin’s advice to present to the emergency department. As soon as Dr. Larkins left the room, Maria leaned toward me and began expressing her deep concern about the financial cost of the emergency department. I nodded in understanding and told her that we would do our best to resolve her worries; she agreed. I shared Maria’s worries with Dr. Larkins, and we spent the next half hour along with the free clinic coordinators ensuring that Maria would receive the necessary financial aid. Later that week, I learned that Maria went to the emergency department, and her blood sugar was now under control. Maria’s experience was typical at the RIFC, where non-English speaking patients often felt more at ease confiding their troubles and concerns to others who speak their native language. Through my experiences with patients such as Maria, I realize that it is essential for patients to be culturally represented by their provider, as an interpreter may not always be available. I wish to become a physician so that through our shared language and culture, I can be a representation and make patients like Maria feel more comfortable and confident to share their concerns, allowing her to receive the best care possible.

After interpreting for three years, I then pursued a more active role in the care of patients as an Ophthalmic Assistant. One day, I saw “Jane,” an older woman experiencing blurred vision. As she sat in the examination room holding the occluder during her eye exam, she squinted, blinked, changed her posture, grumbled, and continuously requested first dimmer and then brighter lights. Her vision had been almost 20/20 a few months earlier; now, the “E” indicating 20/400 visual acuity on the well-lit screen proved a challenge for her. The testing screen revealed bleeding in the macula of both eyes, which gravely compromised her vision; the treatment required monthly injections. Jane’s tears engulfed her eyes as she confessed that her relatives had gone blind from eye disease. I pulled a chair over to sit before her, remained calm, and listened while placing a gentle, comforting hand on her back. I thoroughly addressed her concerns, pointing to the 3D anatomical poster on the wall to show her the source of the bleeding and where the doctor would insert the needle. I explained the positive outcomes we had had with other patients with the same condition and the possible risks. Jane sat back, took a deep breath, and expressed her intention to stick to her treatment diligently. It became clear that kindness and empathy were powerful instruments for Jane’s treatment. However, I strive to have a more active role in the care of my patients. In training to become a physician, I aspire to obtain the practical medical knowledge that, along with the comfort of understanding, will best help my future patients heal.

Dayana’s surgery sparked my interest in medicine, which I then developed through my own experiences in healthcare. My goal is to serve, educate, advocate for, and represent the Hispanic community as a physician, striving to provide each patient with the care they deserve regardless of their socioeconomic background. Seeing patients at their most vulnerable times also compelled me to become a doctor, and I aspire to provide kindness, guidance, and medical care that will improve the quality of life of those patients. I wish to be the best I can be for underrepresented patients like Maria and vulnerable patients like Jane; this keeps me eager and motivated to become a doctor.","Studying in Barcelona, I met and shared time with individuals from all over the world. During one of our activities, we were in a competition where we had to develop ‚Äúan interesting story about the day in the life of a ten-year-old boy.‚Äù Our team members had diverse upbringings as we all came from different countries, and in fact, from different continents!

I met Steph when she was in 10th grade. She told me that although her English proficiency was on par with 10th-grade students, her high school insisted on placing her in ESL classes because she had a ""thick"" accent. Being in ESL prevented her from taking Honors or AP courses, which put her at a disadvantage for college admission. At the time, I was a senior in high school and had been through a similar situation in the past; I took it upon myself to help her. I went with Steph to our guidance counselor and spoke about the situation. I explained my story ,and how transitioning from ESL to traditional courses improved my pronunciation and speaking confidence. I also encouraged Steph to emphasize that she needed help with accent reduction but that language wise, she was on par with her peers. Our counselor agreed and advocated for Steph to be placed in conventional classes, where the school would monitor her performance.

Likewise, many patients struggled to get an appointment when the vaccine became available. This position made me aware that patients may have the best intentions to improve or maintain good health, but getting the proper treatment may be more difficult for them than anticipated. Hence, it taught me to be vigilant when ensuring my patients have the resources to obtain the treatment they need.",1,1,2
2023,14965721,,29,Man,MEX,0,,1,1,"My parents and I are undocumented immigrants from Oaxaca, Mexico. Prior to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive action, I grew up without employment authorization and protection from deportation. During my childhood, my parents did not speak English fluently, lacked a higher education, and had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. I attended a high school where many of my peers did not pursue college. Despite these barriers, I excelled in my AP coursework, extracurricular activities, and was the my family to go to college. The uncertainty associated with my legal status makes it difficult to plan my educational goals beyond two years. I continue to remain ineligible for most federal and state financial aid. My parents do not have a basic understanding of higher education such as career preparation, emotional support, and expenses.

I was a high school volunteer at a Flying Doctors Health Fair that day which took place on the same campus as a 5K charity run. I asked the man what was going on and he explained that a child had collapsed on the track. We left the sign-in booth and made our way to a classroom where the boy and his parents were located. As soon as I walked in, I saw the boy wheezing with his face flushed and wet with sweat. My chest tightened and my heart began to race as I heard him struggling to breathe. However, I maintained my composure as I introduced myself to the family. I immediately asked the boy to sit on a student desk and rest his head on his forearms while I left to grab one of the volunteer physicians.

I ran to the medical booth and found Dr. Raul Ruiz, an emergency room physician giving physical examinations. Dr. Ruiz listened patiently as I explained the situation and reassured me that everything was going to be okay. I escorted him to the classroom where I had left the family and he began to ask the parents questions about the boy's medical history. The parents revealed that he had asthma and had forgotten his inhaler at home. Dr. Ruiz then instructed me to get a nurse from the medical booth who had an emergency kit and to call for an ambulance in case the asthma worsened. As I ran back to the medical booth, I prayed for the boy’s health and hoped that the paramedics were only a precaution. Ultimately, the nurse and Dr. Ruiz were both able to find an inhaler and stabilize the boy while the ambulance arrived.

Although this was a brief experience, I was inspired by Dr. Ruiz’s calm leadership and quick thinking. Prior to this, most of my interactions with physicians occurred during my mother’s routine visits where I acted as a translator. These interactions typically left me feeling frustrated and questioning why immigrants, like my parents, often had a difficult time finding a Spanish-speaking physician. However, working with Dr. Ruiz left me feeling empowered, supported, and reassured that the boy and his family were getting the attention they deserved. I began to imagine how my parents' health would improve if they were able to have Spanish-speaking physicians who understood their language, culture, and could appreciate the struggles they faced as undocumented immigrants. Envisioning this type of care for my parents is what fuels my goal to make healthcare more accessible, affordable, and culturally competent.

As a caseworker for the Mobile Clinic Project at UCLA, I was able to get a glimpse of the type of care I want to provide as a physician. During clinic hours, I worked with volunteer physicians and medical students in providing holistic care for medically underserved populations. A client I had worked with was chronically homeless for several years and suffered from severe depression. Through our interactions, I learned that his inability to find stable housing prevented him from getting treatment for his mental health illness. Though he did not have a safety net, I was there to listen to his life story and create a safe and non-judgmental environment. Experiences like these challenged me to get out of my comfort zone and interact with individuals who have complex needs. Over time, I was able to build strong working relationships with clients and found joy in hearing their life updates.

I heard everything as a caseworker. I heard achievements such as clients finally being admitted into a shelter or clients finally feeling a sense of optimism and joy. However, I also heard setbacks such as clients having their personal belongings stolen or relapsing into substance abuse. My experience as a caseworker allowed me to understand the importance of establishing a human connection in a clinical setting. I learned that every human deserves to have their humanity acknowledged and have their personal stories heard. This was an unforgettable experience where I learned how to practice compassion and clinical skills at an equal level. As a physician, I envision treating my patients with the same compassion and empathy that the clinic fostered.

As an undocumented immigrant, my journey to medical school has not been easy. There have been times when I was discouraged from applying to internships, job opportunities, or scholarships based on my immigrant status. However, my immigrant status is also my greatest source of inspiration. Through my storytelling and student activism, I have learned how to become a leader and build coalitions for immigration reform advocacy. I was also the first in my family to graduate from college and obtain my Master of Public Health from an Ivy League institution. Throughout my entire trajectory, I have used my story and immigration status as my North Star in breaking down barriers for other undocumented students. As a future physician, I am committed to providing culturally competent healthcare and being an advocate for health equity among all populations. I am more than confident that my medical training will continue to foster these values and allow me to be a healthcare leader for social change.","As a caseworker, I worked on improving health outcomes among housing-insecure populations. Before this opportunity, I viewed homelessness as an issue related to income and mental health. However, I worked with chronically homeless individuals that had diverse backgrounds such as former police officers, recovered drug addicts, and aspiring artists. The life stories I heard from clients encouraged me to challenge my perspective of homelessness and reflect beyond my scope of understanding. I learned that homelessness is a complex social issue that stems from discrimination as well as social and racial inequities. I also learned that listening to a patient‚Äôs life history can reveal a lot more about their illnesses than simply checking off a symptom checklist. As a physician, I aim to be there for my future patients when they have a setback and help them heal in a manner that occurs with empathy. I hope to continue working with people from different backgrounds in Chicago‚Äôs west side.","As a project specialist at USC, I surveyed Tribal health facilities to gain a better understanding of the gaps in opioid use disorder (OUD) services currently affecting California Tribal communities. I collaborated with a community advisory board in recruiting Tribal health leaders for key informant interviews and developing the methods of dissemination for our project. Through the interviews, we learned that Tribal facilities often combine various sources of funding in a patchwork-like method to sustain their current treatment programs and recovery services. This was particularly evident for facilities that had a focus on traditional medicine as many of these services are ineligible for reimbursement through major health care funding sources. With these findings, we submitted a policy report to the California Department of Health Care Services to advocate for health policies that reimburse traditional healing methods and show that OUD services are fragmented in Tribal communities.",,,1,"I was laid off from my job during the early months of the pandemic which caused me a great amount of financial and mental distress.

Ever since, I’ve read about unmeetable people, mysterious histories, and many articles reminding readers that their contents–whether published in a textbook or within that very entry–remain “poorly understood.” I knew I’d want a part in sharing and expanding that understanding.

I was elected editor-in-chief of my college newspaper, ‘The Heights,’ my junior year. While spending up to 30 hours or more each week managing the paper left me with everything from fewer hours to study to inevitably waking up roommates at 3 a.m. after finalizing each week’s issue, I knew I was contributing to that same goal. Indeed, journalists are not so different from physicians: each seeks to inform others by making intangible, abstract, or detail-laden truths accessible and understandable.

I spent much of sophomore year writing an investigation into how a simple mistake by my college’s IT department left thousands of confidential details about students and staff accessible to nearly anyone at the university. This led my coauthor and I to be quietly threatened with disciplinary action (none ever materialized) as the university did not want us to publish our report. But the right of thousands of students to know about and understand this oversight was far more important. My coauthor and I were the only students who knew all the details, so we had to explain what happened in a way that was clear and accessible to our readers, regardless of whether they were computer scientists or art historians.

Working as a medical scribe for a pediatric neurologist required similar precision–certainly, it was more than an exercise in stenography and typing 80 words per minute (though the importance of the latter should not be understated). I learned when to record every detail–a child’s bedtime down to the quarter hour for sleep training, medication titrations for controlling evening seizures, summer camp plans–and when to listen in silence, as when a mother told us, in a whisper, about abuse inflicted by school assistants on her daughter with Rett Syndrome. Without overstating my otherwise quiet, observant presence buried behind a bulky Workstation on Wheels in the corner of an eight-by-ten exam room, I was always present—listening in and paying attention.

Often, the most important detail I recorded was just that an eight-year-old boy with Angelman Syndrome–a rare genetic syndrome that often leads to pediatric epilepsies–slept, uninterrupted, for eight hours the previous night. “Just,” of course, understates the myriad of interventions that led to such success, the signs of which exhausted parents wore on their faces as they walked into clinic. Parents of children with lissencephaly or yet-to-be-named mitochondrial diseases had in their child’s health records the unthinkable weight of hospice and visiting nurses' notes, sometimes filed just hours before their clinic appointment.

What helped ground me while scrolling through these records and preparing clinic notes is a concept called radical hope. Claimed by everyone from parents to theologians to historians, radical hope can be defined as hope that is available to all people, at all times. Availability on its own, however, is not enough. Such hope must be made accessible.

In clinic, patients and families were always met where they were regarding their understanding of their child’s disease, therapies, and treatments. The clinic’s NP developed a method for navigating the pre-authorization procedure for children with epilepsies resistant to first, second, and third-line treatments. The clinic’s dietician walked parents through why a ketogenic diet was, at times, as effective as antiepileptic medications. The neurologist asked as earnestly about the health of his patient’s parents and their access to care as he did when discussing their children’s care. No suggestion or change went unexplained.

My role as a physician will always lie in bridging the gap between the availability of information and care and a patient’s actual access to these resources. My knowledge of a prognosis or treatment may be only as beneficial as a patient’s own understanding of it, so it will always be my responsibility to ensure patients have real, working understandings of their conditions.

A favorite story of the late Fr. Michael Himes, himself a favorite and storied priest at Boston College, is one from the eighteenth-century biography of the writer Samuel Johnson. In one scene, Johnson and his biographer charter a short boat ride across the river Thames while discussing whether it is beneficial for everyone to be “classically educated” in the liberal arts–even those whose lives traditionally do not require such knowledge. Johnson turns to the uneducated teenager sailing the boat and asks what he would give to know about Orpheus and the Argonauts, the great, mythical sailors who searched for the Golden Fleece. To gain such knowledge, the boy replies, “I would give what I have.” Johnson, impressed with the boy's response, tips him double, and concludes that in fact, it is one’s nature to give everything to learn.

I’d have tipped him too. But I’d have sat with him and helped him search for the Argonauts on Wikipedia first.","At Boston College, I became particularly interested in working with populations that have been systematically excluded from and underserved by their communities. As a volunteer at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP), service began with allowing myself to be vulnerable to the needs and experiences of those I served. Indeed, the lives of those with whom I worked were considerably different than my own, and my goal was not to simply search for parallels between our lived experiences. _x000D_
_x000D_
Instead, choosing to consider their lives complexly became essential to how I volunteered and will be central to how I will support patients as a physician. Part of my role at BHCHP involved administering patient care surveys to patients waiting in clinic. While my role was limited to helping record responses, I spoke with patients to better understand the intricate challenges they faced in accessing high quality care, and how BHCHP could work to respond. _x000D_
","I administered patient care surveys to those receiving regular medical care at the BHCHP clinic. The survey was written in a tone that assumed respondents were unhoused. While this was often true, when I reached the ‚Äúcomments‚Äù section with one patient, he told me that, in fact, he was not homeless. He had just recently been able to transition to a supportive housing program, and he wanted me to make note of this to provide some additional context to his other responses, and that the survey should be changed._x000D_
_x000D_
This was not something I could solve; there was no manager to whom I could bring this patient‚Äôs concern. But I made myself available to hear him, to respond carefully, and to always encourage patients to share with me as much as they were comfortable (which, sometimes, was nothing). As it was made clear to me, along with clinicians and other staff members, we were often among the only ones willing to listen to anything many of these patients wished to share.",,,1,"Until March of 2020, I was working part-time as a medical scribe at Massachusetts General Hospital. Unsurprisingly, the office soon transitioned to telemedicine visits, and my position was put on hold ‚Äúindefinitely.‚Äù_x000D_
_x000D_
Students were soon sent home from my undergraduate institution. I requested a waiver from Boston College to remain on campus, hoping that some office visits might continue in person, and that I might be able to continue scribing. Many scribes in the Emergency Department there were also college students forced to leave their campus housing, but they were not granted any waivers to stay. I chose to retrain as an emergency medicine scribe and began working in the ED by April rather than return home. Though scribes play a small role in a patient‚Äôs ED visit, I knew it was still worthwhile for me to apply my skills, even if it only meant that an attending physician could leave a few minutes early, or that patients could look at their doctor instead of a screen during a visit.",1,0,2

It is no surprise that news articles have regarded our community as one of the best places to live in the nation. My experience, however, differed drastically from that of my cousin Martinez, who was born with cerebral palsy, adopted by our grandmother, and raised in the southside of Chicago. I grew to learn more about him and his experiences when he and grandma moved into our home for a period of time after struggling financially. I saw how multiple surgeries and his living conditions had affected his life and can only imagine how powerless he has felt, however despite the obstacles he has faced he has always been ambitious and remained a positive outlook on life. 

In having witnessed my cousin navigate his life as a disabled minority living off the limited income of a single guardian, I am aware that there are complex socioeconomic factors that contribute to disparities in healthcare. I recognize my privilege in my upbringing and I understand how many others, like Martinez, do not have a say in their environment or physiological condition. Inspired by what I had witnessed and driven by my interest to research, watch informative videos, and read articles outside of my academic studies, I investigated other disparities in our healthcare system. I was stunned at the limited distribution of healthcare providers throughout my state and shocked at the high maternal mortality rates in our minority and underserved communities.

Because of this knowledge, during the pandemic, I sought opportunities that would connect me more to my local underserved community and volunteered for the Good Samaritan COVID-19 helpline which assisted my community with information about the virus and with testing and vaccination appointments. I listened intently to how the pandemic was impacting my community, how families struggled maintaining jobs, and how worried they were for the health of their loved ones. Although I initially thought my job was simple I recognize my guidance and reassurance may have had a huge impact on these families navigating the world in uncertain times. 

Interested in expanding my clinical experience, I gained a position as a medical scribe in the emergency department. I was initially overwhelmed with my job as it was a step out of my comfort zone: the environment was new, there was a constant babble of alarms chirping, phones ringing, overhead announcements, and a lot of unfamiliar terminology. As I gradually grew accustomed to the conditions, I began learning more about my community's struggles. For instance, although I had spent most of my life living in north Georgia I had not anticipated seeing how prevalent drug addiction and homelessness were. 

I also learned a great deal about the demands of an ED physician. Paired with Dr.Halligan, I observed her approach a patient and ask, “¿Dónde está tu dolor?” the patient began motioning toward their abdomen and explaining their symptoms in Spanish. She examined the patient, gently reassured them, and discussed the plan all in proficient Spanish. I had difficulty understanding the conversation and began to reflect on how equally alienated and confused patients might feel being surrounded by an unfamiliar language. I was impressed by Dr.Halligan’s dedication to eliminating the language barrier and was inspired to start an introductory Spanish course. 

In another encounter, a man with a history of CHF presented to the ED complaining of chest pain. Upon questioning, he expressed that he had stopped taking his medications for the past few months because he no longer had insurance and was now relying on special water marketed as a panacea. The patient was adamant that his intake of electrolyte-infused water had improved his condition over the last few months despite his current pain. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing as I quietly jotted down notes in the corner of the room. I found his situation to be tragic as he, pressured by economic hardship, felt the need to look for alternatives to his medications. Unfortunately, he would be one of many patients who were unable to continue taking their medications due to limited expenses or lack of insurance. This experience illustrated to me how damaging disparities can be and has reminded me that when it comes to treatment plans physicians can only advise patients and inform them of their options, while the power to make decisions is left to the patient. 

Through my experiences, I have witnessed the direct consequences of socioeconomic disparities on our patients’ health and I have gathered that much like the cycle of poverty, health disparities are, too, cyclical in nature. I recognize that many people are struggling due to circumstances that they themselves cannot directly control. I believe as a physician it is important to recognize the barriers patients have in accessing resources and attempt to stop the damning cycle. I hope that I can one day use my compassionate understanding of disparities to provide quality healthcare to communities in need.","Growing up as an African American in the suburbs of North Georgia, I‚Äôm accustomed to constantly being surrounded by people with different religions, ethnicities, cultures, languages, and viewpoints. Collaborating and working alongside classmates with drastically different backgrounds has in some ways broadened my world view.  My understanding of global history and desire to study Japanese has also encouraged me to consider others‚Äô perspectives. In addition, my experience as an ED scribe has enhanced my ability to understand other individuals particularly those struggling with mental health and drug abuse. I recognize that traumatic experiences can bring about these difficulties and I witnessed how these issues impact the family and community. I believe that being open to diverse perspectives improves patient care as it assists with being able to make educated decisions, collaborating with peers, and connecting with diverse patient populations. ","During my time volunteering for the Good Samaritan COVID-19 helpline I assisted the local Atlanta community in receiving free appointments for testing and vaccinations. I remember listening to how the pandemic was impacting a mother who, while juggling multiple responsibilities, was trying to get her kids back in school after being exposed to another sick child. I listened closely and comforted her as I scheduled appointments for the entire family. I believe that my effort impacted not only her, but also the many other families in the community. ",,,1,"I began to understand the severity of COVID-19 and the upcoming pandemic when my coach called a meeting to announce the cancellation of ACC athletic events for the remainder of the spring of 2020. I promptly packed home and finished my classes online. I had applied for many summer undergraduate research experience programs, but sadly received letters about their cancellation. I spent that summer in quarantine with my family focusing on running and reflecting on recent events. Upon my return to school both academic and athletics had changed dramatically. Throughout the school year in preparation for the summer I planned to shadow local physicians and volunteer at a local hospital however when I emailed and called to apply they said their programs were still postponed. I then began reaching out to local clinics who told me they were not currently accepting any shadowing or volunteering. I was devastated but was able to volunteer at a Vet Clinic and Good Samaritan.",0,0,1

After losing two grandparents to lung cancer and my grandmother being diagnosed with a brain tumor, the word healthcare was riddled with anxiety and intimidation for our family. Staying out of the “know” was the best way for my parents to avoid the heartbreak and uneasiness healthcare has given them in the past. Knowing this, I was ready to accompany my parents to the doctor when abnormal symptoms arose. When the physician told my mother that she has diabetes, and my father has prostate cancer, shock and dismay followed. Feeling scared, vulnerable, and powerless were just some of the flooding of emotions I remember. Will this change their quality of life? Is this manageable? What is the next step? Questions came pouring out as the physician listened quietly. When we finished, she confidently responded to each inquiry. She was empathetic, passionate, knowledgeable, and in the end, optimism replaced our worries. 
Our family’s policy of staying in the dark was obsolete that day. A single conversation with our physician allowed us to move past despair and hopelessness, which sparked an internal drive in me to comprehend healthcare, console the vulnerable, and offer guidance during uncertainty. To dedicate my life to these new goals, I faced a significant decision; leave the architecture program I was currently enrolled in, for a new frontier in medicine. I knew being a doctor encompassed more than science classes and incorporated many of the skills I already possess and paralleled with architecture; empathy, communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. My experiences in the Las Vegas General ED were pivotal in my decision to pursue healthcare and refine my skills for medical school. 
Keeping up with the bustle of the Las Vegas General ED is challenging, especially when you are hauling a computer on wheels into the blistering summer heat of an ambulance bay. Despite the unpleasantries, I felt excited each shift as a medical scribe because there was an opportunity to learn a new aspect of medicine that led me closer to fully understanding the entire picture of healthcare. On one shift, the physician and I ran over to see an 18-year-old girl sobbing with her family. After addressing the medical emergency and explaining that their daughter needs evaluation for a heart condition, they flooded us with questions. “I don’t understand how this could happen?” her mother cried, “She is a soccer player and has a scholarship. Will she ever play again?” At that moment, I saw in them my own family and our shared pursuit of clarity. I studied how the physician expertly navigated concerns, and my time studying these interactions as a scribe was instrumental in solidifying my decision to go to medical school. 
One morning I awoke with a text from my manager, and the message was terrifying. A mass shooting on the Las Vegas strip occurred the night before, and we needed more coverage to help with the influx of patients. Saddened and shocked, I quickly rushed over early to meet with my assigned physician. Throughout the day we made sure to sit fully with each patient, assessing not only their physical injuries but also their mental state. “Life altering events are remembered vividly,” the physician explained to me, “they will remember our interactions today for the rest of their lives.” Towards the end of our shift, we both realized we could do better to make all types of interactions like this, even the diagnoses we have seen dozens of times. The reason to seek any medical help is a life altering event for a patient, and our goal was to guide a patient through their distress with empathy and compassion, just like my primary physician did for my family. I was able to see first-hand how trust was developed, how to fully connect with a patient, and how to individualize an interaction and provide guidance when a patient is under distress. These types of interactions are what inspired my drive for medical school, and I focused on using this communicative style as a model for every future interaction, learning how I can be the type of physician that moves others past despair and hopelessness. 
When I was an architecture student, I wanted to construct green buildings, bridges, and perhaps even hospitals. Accompanying my parents on that fateful appointment years ago offered a different blueprint for my life, one that I am thrilled to be adding to. In the end, I am excited that what enticed me about architecture; goal setting, collaboration, and being detail-centered are also abundant in medicine. I was fortunate to refine these skills while developing new ones specific to healthcare, such as patient-centered care, effective communication, and becoming comfortable providing care in ambiguous situations. Changing paths allowed me to write a new philosophy for my family and I; one where “being in the know” is life-affirming and caring, a mantra that embodies my “why?”. It’s the drive that fuels me toward my goal every day.","As a Court Appointed Special Advocate for foster children, I represent abused and neglected children in court to advocate for their best interest in overall wellness. After an intensive training, I was assigned a girl who has been in foster care for over one year. During the time I developed a relationship with her, I grew to understand multiple viewpoints which I have never been exposed to before. I learned to understand trauma responses and underlying issues causing distrust, which allowed me to develop a relationship based off understanding and empathy. I observed how cultural ideals fostered development and I saw issues facing multiple levels of socioeconomic backgrounds. I also learned how nutrition and health are pivotal in a child‚Äôs progress. These experiences gave me first-hand knowledge about issues faced by marginalized communities and ways to help address inequalities by utilizing resources and developing connections based off empathy.","As a volunteer for the American Society for Microbiology, I coordinated activities with after school programs and low-income schools for science experiments. On one occasion, we went to an elementary school to do a four-week science fair challenge. As I approached my group, I was met with boredom and ‚Äúisn‚Äôt science just plants and animals?‚Äù. To show that science is more, I took them to research a wide range of topics. I watched as their eyes lit up as we stumbled on robotics and other topics. For the next four weeks I was met with excitement about the next new discovery. Afterwards, I was told stories from teachers and parents about how our projects increased ‚Äúwhy‚Äù inquiries in the classroom and at home. This experience informed my future goals of science education in medicine. Allowing science to be understood creates a friendly environment to ask questions, which in turn can translate into acting for your own health by asking about and understanding preventative measures. ",,,1,"The week I defended my thesis for my Master‚Äôs Degree in Biology, Las Vegas shut down due to COVID-19.

I also responded to an emergency declaration to help the University Medical Center process a massive influx of COVID-19 tests from around the valley. I worked with a biotech company focusing on a novel quick COVID-19 testing method to keep businesses open safely and reduce public health risks. These transformative experiences allowed me to refine my critical thinking and laboratory skills to help the community during one of the most difficult times. I developed resilience and the ability to further understand healthcare in terms of public health, preparing me to have a background for future challenges in medicine.",1,1,2

My design team had gotten to know Esther for her love of the outdoors, her devotion to her family and her experience living with interstitial lung disease. We met through a project in collaboration with Michigan Medicine to design an improved oxygen tank transport device for delivering high-flow oxygen to patients with end-stage lung disease during medically-required walks. Daily exercise requires an IV pole, monitor, and high-flow nasal cannula attached to a 130 pound, H-sized oxygen tank and humidifier, along with two to three assisting staff members. By Esther’s account, walking amidst a parade of equipment made her feel unstable. She described walks as logistically exhausting for her and medical staff. This was the problem we were here to address.

Our goal was to design an optimized transport system that consolidated all the necessary equipment onto a single cart that could be operated by one staff member. Esther had unknowingly become a valuable team member for her unique perspective. To better understand the limitations of the old system, I asked the respiratory technician if I could try it out myself. He placed a nasal cannula around my head and tied an IV line to my wrist. Just as Esther described, I used a wheelchair as a walker. The technician turned on the humidifier and started the flow of oxygen, following closely behind me pushing the oxygen tank cart, while a nurse shimmied the IV pole alongside us. Mid-walk the humidifier battery died. Cold, dry oxygen burned the inside of my nostrils, making it hard to breathe. Humidifier is non-optional – noted. Then as I bent down to pick up some dragging tubing, the wheelchair rolled away, jeopardizing my balance. I experienced the same challenges and feelings of unease that Esther had described and observed new issues I felt we could address. It became clear that the current transport system, which was intended to build patients’ strength, was limiting their mobility.

It was Esther’s personal account of using the old transport system that seeded my emotional connection to this project. Getting to know her as a once-active parent and wife expanded my focus beyond how to safely deliver medical care to creating a product that supported her morale and independence. Effective health care goes beyond the technical. As standards of care continuously evolve, I look forward to being a physician that uses imagination and a clear understanding of my patients’ unspoken needs to deliver outcomes with true value.

I now work as a research coordinator in a pediatric intensive care unit, where I enroll children into clinical studies and process their samples for experimental use. Our research focuses on the role of T cells in acute upper respiratory virus infections in children. My past experiences with pediatric patients have hugely shaped my clinical interests and aspiration to be a physician. Pediatric medicine offers the opportunity to build strong, long-term connections with young patients and their families that can impact the trajectory of a child’s lifelong health. Participating in pediatric research has deepened my understanding of the clinical considerations unique to young patients, yet the intensive care environment has challenged me to adapt how I connect with patients and their families. The relationships I previously built on laughter and shared experiences as a hospital volunteer are no longer feasible. Many of the patients I work with cannot speak for themselves. Their parents are scared.

“High risk of death” were the words I read on the chart of a six year old with no past medical history, now on life support as the result of the flu. As I approached his parents, their faces showed the anguish of the last five days, but the mother’s grasp on her son’s hand told of the six years prior. Such instances of unpredictably severe respiratory infection are the impetus behind our research, but it is especially difficult to approach these families about research participation. In these cases, I earn a family’s trust through patience, deference and transparency. By thoroughly explaining the goals of our research, speaking in the family’s preferred language and dedicating time to their questions, I help them independently make a decision for their child that they know will be respected. Even in devastating circumstances, the majority of families chose to participate, motivated by the opportunity to benefit children hospitalized in the future. These interactions have led me to see patients and families as true collaborators in research and not merely as peripheral contributors.

The strong connections I formed with patients and their families have continued to inspire my ambition to study medicine. I have witnessed how effective clinical care and meaningful innovation rely on eliciting patients’ trust and understanding their experiences. Research and new medical technologies are driving advancements in medical care and demand physicians that will challenge convention to improve their patients’ outcomes. I am confident that as a physician I will bridge patients’ narratives with clinical insight to deliver inventive care.","Walking down the busy hallways of the Audubon Pediatric Clinic, you will notice that all the staff are fluent in both English and Spanish. For the clinic‚Äôs predominantly low-income, Spanish-speaking patients, this means communicating without limitations at all stages of their visit._x000D_
_x000D_
Attaining Spanish fluency has been a longtime goal of mine, but currently my moderate proficiency is not reliable enough for the patient care environment. My job collecting blood samples for research would not be possible without the bilingual nurses, medical assistants, phlebotomists and translators who have all helped me communicate with patients and their families. The staff taught me colloquial Spanish phrases to offer comfort, educated me on prevailing values among patient families and prepared me to actively engage patient families in their child‚Äôs care. I saw firsthand how language concordance allows patients to dictate their own care, and equips physicians to provide better informed care.","My first time meeting Henry, he eagerly told me about his favorite activities: riding his bike and playing soccer. Other than a congenital limb defect affecting his right hand, he was a typical, active six-year-old boy, and our team had the exciting honor of designing him a custom neuroprosthetic device at no cost to his family. This initiative was driven by the principle that, when equitably distributed, medical technology has the potential to mitigate the effects of social health determinants._x000D_
_x000D_
Getting to know Henry helped us build a device that accommodated his physical deficiencies, but also his hobbies and preferences.

Number of patients unknown."" I went into emergency response mode: Lights, sirens, directions. My partner pulled up the directions and instructed me to turn the ambulance around. We were driving on a country road at night, so finding a place to turn around was difficult. When a driveway appeared, I slowed to turn. Suddenly, our ambulance was thrust into a 360-degree spin. During the brief, violent crash, my head hit the driver window, and my grip tightened on the steering wheel to regain control. When the ambulance stopped spinning, my partner and I watched the dually truck that just rear-ended us crash into an electrical pole. Though concussed (as I later found out), my first response was to render aid to passengers in the other vehicle by getting them safely out of the fiery truck. I braced one of the patient's broken legs and applied burn bandages to his forearms. Both patients were stabilized and left for the hospital in another ambulance. As the dust settled from the accident, my call to be a physician was solidified. My call is to help people through the most challenging moments of their lives.

A cardiac fellow, Dr. Arain, helped me through the most challenging moment of my life. My father had complications after an orthopedic surgery, which resulted in two pulmonary embolisms (PE). One cardiac fellow recommended an immediate Ekosonic Endovascular System, a new procedure using ultrasound waves to dissolve PEs for patients in severe respiratory distress. The operation was risky, so we investigated second opinions. During this time, Dr. Arain took over the shift and reviewed my father's case. He believed the PEs were of concern, but the procedure would be too risky since my father was not in respiratory distress and his vital signs were stable. Dr. Arain used Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) to present a different plan allowing my father's system to dissolve the PEs naturally. Within a few weeks, my father's health improved. I cannot speak to the result had my father undergone the procedure, but I can speak to Dr. Arain, an advocate for my father's well-being. Thankful and inspired to have witnessed this fellow's expertise and responsibility to my father, I recognized the importance of patient advocacy and EBM.

My interaction with Dr. Arain left me curious about the causes of cardiovascular diseases. Eager to investigate my new questions, I joined a research lab that examines the individual roles of junctional proteins (JP) in cardiomyocytes. Each JP contributes to the heart's function, and cardiovascular diseases can arise when mutations occur. By linking cardiovascular disease to specific mutations, we can better understand how to treat the source of disease instead of the symptoms. This research is important to me because it will be incorporated into future treatment plans for patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Moving forward in my medical path, I plan to continue with research and implement EBM in my future treatment practices.

Outside of research, shadowing provided the opportunity to see patient advocacy in action. One physician, Dr. Buzzard, examined an eight-year-old boy in the emergency room with a leg rash. Upon examination, he diagnosed the child with cellulitis and noticed other physical factors indicating the rash might be due to neglect. The parents were on their phones, constantly arguing and vaguely answering the doctor's questions. After noticing the parent's demeanor, Dr. Buzzard decided to sit down with them. He carefully chose words that led them to focus on their son's treatment. Dr. Buzzard went above and beyond to be an advocate for this little boy. My goal is to bring these same meaningful conversations into people's lives.

The Biomedical Masters Program allowed me to be an advocate for patients, as I witnessed with Dr. Buzzard. As a Physician Task Facilitator in the emergency room, one of my roles was to ensure patients were comfortable and supported during wait times. One patient, 'Ren,' alerted the department of his discomfort by screeching at the top of his lungs. I tried to calm him, but he was too intoxicated. Due to his disruptive behavior, Ren was sedated twice over two hours and woke up louder each time. Hearing the discomfort in his voice, I listened carefully, thinking it could be a clue. That's when I heard the screeching was him incoherently yelling, ""pee!"" Ren needed to go to the bathroom. I told the medical resident my interpretation of his screeching, and the resident ordered a foley catheter. Two and a half liters of urine drained from him in forty minutes. Afterward, Ren became calm and quickly fell asleep. Fueled by my interactions with Dr. Arain and Dr. Buzzard, I was able to listen to Ren and become his advocate in his time of discomfort.

In the ambulance accident, my first instinct was to help others who were injured. My aptitude to help them and others, such as Ren, deepens my confidence in becoming a physician. These experiences as a first responder and an advocate for patients have strengthened my commitment to medicine. My goal is to continue to grow in knowledge and expertise by attending medical school as I continue answering my call to be a physician.","After joining the Panhellenic community, 'Liz' and I discussed the recruitment process. ""I didn't get a choice in my chapter,‚Äù she frustratingly explained. Liz believed she was dismissed from other chapters because she was Jewish.

Now, my relationships can start on a more open platform to foster dependability. I will bring these skills to Rush Medical College when interacting with future patients and fellow students.","According to the US Census Bureau, 17.3% of individuals living in Chicago live below the poverty line. While working as an EMT-B in Grimes County, I saw poverty's direct impact on individuals' health. 'Tom' was a 36-year-old male who had been stabbed in the stomach. He needed transport to a hospital to treat the uncontrollable bleeding wound. ""I cannot afford that,"" Tom looked at me. ""I have a baby, and I have no money."" I explained CHI St. Joseph's affordable plans, but he refused transport. These moments drive me toward becoming a physician to help individuals struggling with receiving proper medical care due to financial disparities.

My father and I were visiting my uncle in the suburbs of Chicago, and while we waited for him to return home from work, our plans for the afternoon suddenly changed. Getting out of the car, my father accidentally slammed the door on his finger, cutting the skin open and exposing the bone. Immediately, we got back in the car and rushed to the hospital. Despite my dad screaming in pain, I was surprisingly calm in the midst of all the chaos and blood. The first thing I did was call my uncle, who was a practicing orthopedic surgeon. Before long, we were at the hospital, and my uncle was standing at the entrance waiting for us. With grit and haste, he stopped the bleeding, closed the wound, and ultimately saved my dad’s finger. At this moment, I knew that medicine was a potential path for my future, allowing me to care for others the same way my uncle did for my dad. Unbeknownst to me, this memory would later foster a deep passion for medicine.

As time passed, many of my interests in life changed, but my fascination with medicine was constant. Eager to learn more about the field, I started my first shadowing experience in my senior year of high school. One day in the orthopedic surgery department of a nearby hospital, a new patient who I will call Steven came in to receive cortisone injections for his arthritis. When my mentor asked about his eating and social habits, a look of despair filled Steven’s eyes. I listened as he explained how his closest grocery store was miles away, and as a result, he frequently ate fast food. As I aspire to be a physician whose approach to healing is multifaceted, Steven’s visit further showed me that health is affected by more than just pills and procedures. It is heavily influenced by circumstances that take place outside of the doctor’s office.

Having a grandmother who also has arthritis and experiences food insecurity, I empathized with Steven. My grandma would often stress as she had to travel farther and spend more money than she wanted to on groceries. In Steven’s case, living in a food desert contributed to his weight gain and worsening joint pain. The next time I saw Steven, I gave him the same information I had given my grandmother on local farmers’ markets and government services that would broaden his access to affordable nutrition. This experience strengthened my desire to one day heal patients through medicine while addressing the social determinants of health that affect their daily lives. Over the next four years, I made the most of my shadowing experiences in orthopedics and cardiology, while still working to improve my community through organizing blood drives and taking an active role in my church’s food pantry. These pivotal years enhanced my passion for medicine and zeal for addressing disproportionate barriers to living a healthy life.

In addition to the obstacles that patients face outside the walls of medicine, their experience at the doctor’s office matters too. Patients are at a disadvantage when they do not receive compassionate, culturally sensitive care. While physicians of any identity can provide this care, mounting evidence suggests that health outcomes can be improved when physicians and their patients have similar lived experiences. As an African American male, I can attest to the importance of being able to relate to my doctor. While my friends would often recount instances of feeling unheard or misunderstood, I always felt safe and cared for. I was fortunate enough to have a thoughtful and attentive, black pediatrician who became my role model and the epitome of how I want to treat my future patients.

I met even more amazing doctors when I joined the I Am Abel Foundation, an organization dedicated to helping underrepresented students become physicians. At the new member gala, I saw more black and brown doctors than ever before. This experience was so much more profound than it seems; every physician there wanted to help pre-med students like myself achieve our goals. Often hearing the phrase “You can’t be what you can’t see”, that night I was truly able to see what I aspire to become. Striving to pay forward the support my physician mentors gave me, I began serving as a mock interviewer for college and scholarship interviews. My desire to support and encourage my peers can be summed up in the words of I Am Abel’s founder, Dr. Conway, “ …Always leave a wedge in the door so that others may follow.” I see every stage that I pass on my way to becoming a physician as a new opportunity to assist someone else to walk through that same door. Visualizing a future with more diversity in medicine, I will continue to motivate my peers as we work towards becoming the physicians our communities need.

Unwavering in my pursuit of becoming a physician, I aspire to instill change in my community, combat the social and cultural barriers that impact my future patients’ health, and smoothen the path to medicine so future generations of doctors can better reflect the diverse population they will serve.","Being a preacher‚Äôs kid and attending catholic school, I did not meet many people with a different religion from my own until I was in college. In addition to having the opportunity to interact with people from unique, diverse backgrounds, I witnessed how aspects of one‚Äôs identity are interwoven with other areas of their daily life. One experience that stands out in my mind occurred during my senior year when I was shadowing. I saw a patient around the same age as me who needed heart surgery and could not accept blood transfusions for religious reasons. My mentor asked if the patient could explain more about her beliefs, and as I listened, I gained insight into the religion and values of someone unlike myself. I also witnessed how these factors influence patient care. Specifically, I saw how cultural sensitivity and a desire to understand others are tenets of patient-centered care that help make people feel heard and safe at an often difficult and vulnerable time.","During my first year of college, I assisted in planning and holding peaceful protests on campus following several disturbing incidents. That year, a student wore blackface as part of their Halloween costume, and hateful notes signed by the KKK were found etched into walls, toilet seats, and more. More common was when students from certain backgrounds unknowingly said or did something hurtful towards their peers of minority backgrounds. Often these students touched others' hair without permission because they had never seen ""something like that before."" Through these experiences, I learned how to put my anger aside in the moment and instead help those around me understand how their actions were offensive and why a lack of exposure is no longer an appropriate justification for their actions. The result of the protests, meeting with the university's administration, and using our collective voice to address our concerns changed the atmosphere on campus for the better.",,,1,"Since I started shadowing my senior year of high school, in addition to everything I learned, those experiences served as snapshots of my future career if I work hard. When these experiences ceased due to COVID-19, I looked inward to rediscover the reasons I wanted to become a physician in the first place. These reasons include addressing social determinants of health, working to create more equitable and accessible healthcare, and paying forward all the support and encouragement I have been given. One positive aspect concerning my classes was that my professors provided many more office hours to accommodate students living in different time zones. While I was still able to attend classes, I took advantage of the extra help and learned how to best prioritize my time. I made significant progress in this regard during my last three semesters of college. As a result, my academic performance improved, and I ultimately graduated with honors in the spring of 2021.",1,1,2

Although my interest in science continued to grow during my resistance training career, I suppressed that interest to not put additional financial burden on my parents. To provide me with the best education, my mom moved across the globe with the sole purpose to care for me. She endured all the hardship that came with being a first-generation immigrant, and practically raised me as a single mother. Everything changed when she was diagnosed with stage I cervical cancer soon after my graduation. Her battle against cancer solidified my decision to become a physician, which transformed my curiosity in science into a tangible desire to make a difference.
My mom’s battle with cancer showed me the direct consequences of misinformation and poor communication. The initial prognosis was great, given her early diagnosis. Unfortunately, that hope disappeared when she opted for alternative medicine due to some online ""health gurus"" she followed. Upon realizing that her chance of survival diminished with every second, I began frantically trying to convince her to seek professional medical treatment. No matter how pleadingly I begged her in tears, or how many systematic reviews I sent her in despair, she was determined to continue down her path. By the time she realized her remedies were failing, the tumor had metastasized. The pain of witnessing one of the strongest women I know tortured to skin and bones, the remorse of implementing such a confrontational approach, and the will to put my multilingual communicative skills to meaningful use in this diverse society, so susceptible to misinformation, all propelled me towards a career in medicine in hopes that similar incidents could be prevented.
To my family, this career change may have seemed like an emotional decision, though my interest in science and medicine stems from my early childhood memories. My grandma had a booklet with dozens of scientific experiments suitable for kids and would find the required materials to help me conduct them. I vividly remember the experiment of Pasteurization in which we poured milk into two glass containers, brought one of them to a boil, sealed them and left them in the balcony. When I opened them 2 days later, “Yuck”, the pungent smell coming out of the container with spoiled milk served as my first introduction to control group and treatment group. I deeply appreciated the scientific method especially after I began resistance training and had many questions unanswered. What kinds of adaptation do different training stimuli yield? Is pre-training carbohydrate intake really ergogenic? I was mesmerized by how nuanced a topic can be and the logical process of deriving practical recommendations. I would get so excited when a new paper presented findings that went against the consensus, and I had great fun looking into the contributing factors of such discrepancy. Operating based on evidence led to my success in resistance training and has been very intellectual stimulating. As a physician, I look forward to continuing to satisfy my curiosity and vow to never be complacent in this lifelong learning journey.
An opportunity to make a difference emerged during my coaching career when I found out Alex, who had just started resistance training with me after being diagnosed with prediabetes, was vaccine hesitant. Alex was Peruvian with Chinese ancestry. As a Chinese who grew up in South America with many loved ones affected by diabetes, I looked at Alex as the younger brother I never had and mentored him in and outside the gym. My first intuition was to send him all the research showing the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, like I did with my mom. However, with the importance of patient-centered communication in mind, I took a different approach. I sat down with him and acknowledged the validity of his concerns, which made him more accepting of the subsequent information presented. I then compared the relative risk of certain side effects associated with the vaccines to that of contracting the virus. Citing information from reliable sources, I offered basic education on the Central Dogma and debunked some common myths around the vaccine. Alex received his first dose of the vaccine a week after our conversation. For the first time since mom’s passing, I felt noticeable relief, as I realized that while mistakes in the past cannot be undone, one can still learn from those mistakes. As a physician, I will continue to be introspective of my mistakes, while maintaining my pursuit to better the lives of my patients.
The past three years have been arduous but fulfilling. Although I still have to make a conscious effort to reconcile my mom’s early passing, I have learned to channel that remorse to foster permanent discipline, rather than temporary motivation. I will exonerate myself by becoming a doctor who can make a difference, who not only treats patients, but also serves a reliable source of evidence-based information in his community, who fights against medical misinformation, and rebuilds the trust in our healthcare system, one patient at a time.","I grew up in a Chinese household and spent the major portion of my childhood in Argentina. I never knew how unique my experience was until I moved to the U.S in 2010. On the first day of my high school ESL class, we had to share where we came from, and I didn‚Äôt know what to say. Eating steamed buns for breakfast and empanadas for dinner at home was a normal occurrence. Initially, I hated this identity confusion since no one I met shared identities that intersected like my own. But in college, as I began introducing authentic Chinese food to my Latinx friends and teaching my Chinese friends basic conversations in Spanish, I learned to appreciate how my experience can contribute to the essential building of cross-community connection at a time of heightened racial injustice. I look forward to continuing bridging two of the largest ethnic communities as I advance in my medical education.","Growing up in a low income household, I witnessed how most of my relatives developed type II DM as result of unhealthy lifestyles. My observation of metabolic disorders disproportionally affecting low-socioeconomic status households was further reenforced during my time working in clinic. My interest in the role of lifestyle modulations continued to grow during my fitness journey as I learned about the myriad benefits of exercise beyond increasing insulin sensitivity, ranging from protection against cardiovascular diseases, fractures to psychiatric disorders. As a fitness coach, it has been rewarding to offer free coaching services to young trainees who are motivated to improve their health but lack the financial means to hire a personal trainer.",,,1,"I was grieving the death of my mom alone when the pandemic stifled my hope of reuniting with the rest of my family that I learned to cherish even more. Additionally, I was temporarily laid off by the clinic due to reduced patient flow. This overarching sense of powerlessness did not begin to subside until I was called back to work. Most of our patients were seniors who needed routine injections to maintain vision. The nature of working in a small clinic allowed me to get to know many of them on a personal level. I learned that many lived alone and looked forward to coming back to the clinic despite the discomfort of receiving an injection because this visit might be their only social interaction in a month. In the process of assisting my doctor in providing care during the pandemic, I received continuous support from patients as they learned about my aspirations. This symbiotic relationship formed during the pandemic added to my understanding of the patient-provider relationship.",1,0,2

Right off the bat, I was curious about what had happened to the mannequin on the ground. With the goal of determining the cause of death, I consulted with a forensic pathologist who helped me better understand the biological signs that could explain this victim's death - a clear overdose.

My forensics course was one of many that made up a unique healthcare-oriented high school curriculum - the PLTW Biomedical Science program. Each year of the program highlighted a different facet of the biomedical field as a means of understanding medicine not just as clinical science but also as part of a greater institution. During my first year, I took courses that allowed me to play several roles, including that of a physician, a geneticist, a member of an emergency response team and a member of a research and development team. Through each of these various roles, I began to develop an appreciation for how these individuals face real-world challenges. In my second year, we were tasked with building Resh, my group's anatomical skeleton model. Using clay, we pieced together each organ and, in the process, learned about the anatomy and physiology of each organ system. By giving Resh life, I gained an understanding of how the systems worked together to keep the body healthy, from the ground up. After understanding how a healthy body operates, the focus of my third year switched to learning what happens when things go wrong. In doing so, I learned how physicians not only address disease but also aim to prevent disease in the first place. By the conclusion of the curriculum, I was left inspired by what I had learned and by my newfound understanding of the role physicians play in keeping individuals healthy.

Having been fascinated by the gross pathology I learned in high school, I focused my college education on the microscopic by majoring in Cell and Molecular Biology. I became fascinated with how our cells adapted to environmental stressors through intracellular and intercellular signaling. There was something extremely humbling in knowing that small downstream signaling events could lead to great effects on a macroscopic level. With this knowledge, I sought to contribute to the field by participating in research focused on the carcinogenic potential of saccharin, an artificial sweetener. Through my research, I gained a greater appreciation for the way in which our environment can impact our health. Additionally, by taking part in the research process, I learned how research drives many of the evidence-based medical-decision makings that doctors partake in.

Throughout my studies, I was surrounded by like-minded individuals who all loved science; however, I realized that physicians have to interact with individuals from all walks of life. As such, I took it upon myself to learn how to navigate this social challenge through my role as a college resident assistant. While many of the residents had different backgrounds, interests and career paths compared to mine, by building rapport with them, we exchanged trust that allowed for more open communication and disclosure. This ultimately allowed me to develop my self-reflection and interpersonal skills. Altogether, this experience made it clear that physicians should be not only competent in the clinical sciences but also cognizant of the lived human experience, always remembering to treat the patient as an individual first.

With a foundation of medical science and interpersonal communication developed across non-clinical experiences, I sought to find clinical experiences that would firsthand better inform my understanding of the field of medicine. While my first gap year was limited to virtual clinical shadowing and other virtual opportunities as a result of COVID-19, I was fortunate to obtain a role as an emergency department medical scribe during my second year. Over the several months working side by side with various physicians, I became enlightened on their duties and responsibilities beyond patient interaction and care, including administrative tasks, documentation of patient visits and follow-ups, and keeping up with pertinent news, policies, procedures and more. Furthermore, apart from improving my communication skills, I enhanced my medical knowledge through assisted interpretation of lab and diagnostic results, adapted to individual needs to optimize efficiency and workflow, and promoted proactive follow-up in a fast-paced and high-stress environment to reduce patient stay times. This experience has tied up the loose ends of my previous experiences, confirming my desire to become a physician.

What started as an appreciation of anatomy and physiology has developed into an appreciation of and a desire to become a physician. Through my experiences, I have learned that medicine is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field. As such, it requires a passion for life-long learning in the pursuit of helping our fellow human beings. As I continue my journey in medicine, I will always remember that at the heart of medicine is not only a love of the sciences but also a passion to serve others.","While I was born in Saudi Arabia, I was raised in Florida for most of my life. Then, add in my Syrian mom and my Cuban dad and you can imagine the clash of cultures between both my family and the environments in which I was raised. While young, I remember being exposed to the same culture and Arabic language in Saudi Arabia. However, when I moved to Florida, I was exposed to a diverse melting pot of cultures and identities. Surrounded by people of different backgrounds, beliefs and paths of life, I learned about and appreciated the presence of diversity and its importance in enriching culture, inspiring creativity, and promoting understanding of differences. I was also viewed as ‚Äúdifferent.‚Äù Even so, I learned to connect with those around me, uplift their individual cultures and values, and embrace my mixed background, strengths I hope to contribute to my future peers, patients and communities.","As a college resident assistant, I learned about the unique struggles people face based on their backgrounds and identities, which taught me the importance of advocating for diversity and inclusion. One way of doing so was by raising awareness of implicit bias. I first learned about the concept of implicit bias during my training as a resident assistant. Initially, it just felt like another segment of training. However, as I engaged with my residents, I realized just how many preconceived notions I had in response to their majors, backgrounds and affiliations. Henceforth, I pushed myself to learn more about other forms of bias and their effects to share this information with my residents so that they could also identify and address their own biases. In doing so, I helped my residents and our community create a more open-minded, inclusive space. In my future career as a physician, I aim to continue combating barriers to diversity and inclusion by continuing to educate myself and others.",,,1,"Upon earning my bachelor‚Äôs degree in May 2020, I intended to start in-person clinical experiences. However, many of them were halted with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, I took the initiative to find alternatives, which led to engaging in various forms of medical media, such as virtual clinical shadowing, podcasts, blogs and articles, which have been very insightful and taught me a lot about the field of medicine and its different facets. Furthermore, despite it becoming difficult to find a position as a medical scribe, I was able to eventually find an open position at Homestead Hospital in August 2021. As an emergency department medical scribe, I obtained invaluable firsthand experience working alongside a team of physicians and other hospital staff to take care of a diverse patient population. Through this experience, I have grown as a person and gained exposure to the medical field which has only reinforced my motivation to become a physician.",1,0,1

His hands tightly gripping mine and my mother’s as my father weaved in-and-out of the lanes, speeding down I-95. It was that night during the winter of my senior year of high school that I was introduced to medicine. 

Once we got to the hospital, we entered the evaluation room hand-in-hand and were met by an attending psychiatrist. In a calm demeanor, she asked us questions, looking for behavioral signs and subtle clues that were not even on my family’s mind. Even with only an initial interaction, she had found some answers. She made the abnormal seem normal. For weeks, my brother made comments about a radio chip inserted in his head, his own attempt to make sense of the current circumstance. While my family had not understood the meaning of the radio chip, the psychiatrist quickly recognized it as a possible first-episode of psychosis. From that day in the evaluation center, I knew I wanted to be a physician, treating illness in a holistic approach. I wanted to support people like my brother by reducing the stigma associated with certain diagnoses, similarly to how this psychiatrist viewed his behavioral symptoms in terms of any other medical condition.

Two and a half years after my family’s experience in the evaluation center, I returned to that same hospital, spending my summer as a mental health worker, primarily on a unit for female patients with diagnoses ranging from depression to schizophrenia. As a mental health worker, I participated in morning rounds with the healthcare team, listening to the physician present each patient’s case. For that summer I kept a journal of the medications I had heard during rounds, listing their class and contraindications. On my first solo shift after training, I was told I would be one-on-one with a potentially aggressive patient. When I entered the room, she was calm, staring at the wall. She quickly opened up to me, discussing how she had mainly been stable since her bipolar diagnosis. However, due to an eviction notice and other situational factors, she no longer felt in control. I thought about how sudden homelessness would impact anyone and how magnified those effects would be for someone with a disorder causing chemical brain changes. After my experience as a mental health worker, I wanted to learn more about the interaction between medical conditions and situational factors.

After my initial exposure to medicine, I looked to gain more clinical experience, volunteering at my local hospital and obtaining my EMT license. While working on an ambulance for my EMT training, I encountered a patient around my age suffering from rapid blood loss after sustaining a laceration to his foot. When the situation was more under control, the lead EMT asked me to obtain a set of vitals, an important step in obtaining the license. Based on the patient’s blood pressure and heart rate, phrases I have learned came to mind like “hypotension” and “shock”. I wanted to share the data with the lead EMT, but before I could do so, I looked at the patient’s terrified eyes. This was the information not in the textbook. From my prior experience, I knew that while obtaining an accurate set of vitals was necessary, I needed to make the patient feel safe and comfortable. Kneeling down, my eyes met the patient’s and I reassured him that he was receiving excellent care and we would arrive at the hospital shortly.

Over the past year I have worked as an emergency department medical scribe at my local hospital, observing as each physician interacts with patients while keeping their poise during the COVID-19 pandemic. The experience has enabled me to keep mental notes of the diverse range of approaches to patient interactions that I would like to use as a future physician. After the physician and NP or PA see each patient, they discuss the differential, included as part of the documentation. In the collaborative environment of the emergency department, the providers discuss the most likely diagnosis vs. other possible diagnoses. On many occasions after labs and imaging have resulted, the most likely diagnosis is not what the results showed. Watching the steps to diagnosis, I realized the importance of investigating all possibilities and how systems in the body can affect other systems. In this aspect, I think back to that time in the evaluation room, watching as the psychiatrist took into account each symptom and how the brain impacts other systems throughout the body. While psychiatry and emergency medicine encompass different scopes of practice, the goal and the steps to reach that goal involve similar guides.

After watching my brother’s journey to his diagnosis, I knew I wanted to be a physician. The person I had looked up to my entire life had suddenly lost a sense of reality. From there, each patient I have met through volunteer work, research, and clinical experience has reinforced my desire to pursue a medical education. With a medical education, I hope to learn more about the body’s systems and how they interact while also providing support to patients as they struggle to find answers about their illnesses.","Having worked with patients with schizophrenia as a mental health worker and through research at outpatient clinics, I have learned about the unfair stigmatization of people suffering from mental illness. Through many interactions with psychiatric patients, I have been able to learn how society judges people and through no fault of their own, these judgments negatively impact the lives of patients with mental illnesses. _x000D_

While shadowing a psychiatrist in a public clinic in NYC, I met a patient who had spent much of his adult life in and out of prison. The patient‚Äôs arrests paralleled the onset of psychotic episodes. He was unable to afford proper care for his schizophrenia due to chronic unemployment, but when he was stable, he could not even imagine committing any crime. I thought to myself that not only was it unfair that medical care can be unaffordable, but how this particular patient and others like him experienced a vicious cycle of prison stays due to chemical imbalances.","During the pandemic I began volunteering for the online tutoring company UPchieve. Living with members of my family that are educators, I learned the impact online learning had on the educational gap. I did my own research and learned how the achievement gap only increased in low-income households due to lack of technological resources and having parents that were essential workers. Using my skills from my prior tutoring experience, I signed up to volunteer with UPchieve, tutoring algebra and chemistry. In this role, I have been able to help students who otherwise would not be able to afford private tutoring services. In order to help students build their confidence, we walk through problems step by step until they feel comfortable with course concepts. Through the step by step process, each student is able to take an active role in their learning as a way to combat the educational gap.

I was commuting to the hospital to begin a 12-hour shift when I received a call. My Mom was in tears. She explained that my Uncle was resuscitated three separate times earlier that day and had passed. I was shocked. Walking into work, I knew tonight was going to be a struggle. Later that night, as I was recalling the memories I had shared with my Uncle, I read the words “Room 304: CODE BLUE” on the call light monitor at the nurses’ station. Shivers immediately ran down my spine. Within seconds the floor went from calmness to chaos. After calling the code in, I promptly helped push the code cart into the room. The patient’s family members were all frozen in the hallway. I looked up at the wife of the patient and she glanced back at me with eyes full of fear.

I entered the room and saw the man lying there lifeless on the bed. I performed two sets of compressions before the rapid response team arrived. After seeing that they no longer needed my help, my attention then turned to the family. They were still standing outside the room completely broken down, desperate to hear that their loved one was brought back to life. I consoled them. As if they were my own Aunt and Cousins who had experienced a similar trauma that day. I took them to a seating area away from the commotion. I felt obligated to sit with them in an effort to bring them comfort. The patient was brought back after 15 minutes. After, I contemplated what I had just witnessed. I realized I had a true passion for easing the burden of patients and their loved ones as they go through their most vulnerable times. Throughout my life, I have observed many providers care for me and my loved ones as we’ve gone through our toughest times. This, along with my past experiences has motivated me to do the same and pursue medicine.

I was born to two Egyptian, Coptic Christian parents who had just immigrated to the United States in search of a better life. Our faith was instrumental in the way my parents raised me. From an early age, I viewed serving the needy and loving your neighbor as fundamental values. Looking back, the values that were instilled in me as a child are at the core of why I want to be a doctor. Through the church, I started to realize how intrinsically rewarding giving back to the community can be. As I continued my path to medicine, I explored many opportunities that allowed me to serve others.

During my freshman year of college, I embarked on a trip that combined two things I loved: traveling and serving others. I traveled to Peru on a medical mission trip to help set up clinics in impoverished communities. My job for the first part of the day was to check patients in. A man named Javier stood out to me; he complained to us that he has had persistent pain behind his ear and was eager, but scared to have a doctor examine it. I walked with Javier to the examination table. I watched as the doctor was able to make an instant connection with Javier. He examined his ear then pulled a quarter-sized block of ear wax out of his ear. It was a spectacle better than any magic trick I’ve ever seen. These doctors continued to completely change patients’ lives one by one. I was hooked. From that day on I was certain that I wanted to become a physician. The physicians displayed the same desire to alleviate the patients’ burden as I did while working in the hospital. Yet, through their training and education, they were able to accomplish this feat by answering every question and putting each patient’s mind to ease.

When I got back to the States, I quickly explored every opportunity related to medicine. I fulfilled my intellectual curiosity by attending many seminars and enrolling in several electives. I became educated on topics ranging from racial health disparities to innovative cancer therapies. However, the combination of a large course load, many extracurriculars, and a job made me quickly realize that I was stretching myself too thin. Although it was a challenge juggling all my responsibilities, the long days and nights I experienced allowed me to reevaluate and reaffirm how badly I wanted to pursue this field.

Observing physicians interact with their patients always put in perspective what I was studying for. As I stood in the corner shadowing a Neuro-Oncologist, I felt a deep connection with the patients and their families. Their words were hopeful, but I could tell they were anxious about the future. Three of my grandparents passed from cancer so I understood the suffering a family has to endure while watching their loved one’s condition deteriorate.

Standing in that room I felt a similar sense of helplessness as I felt sitting with the patient’s family in the hospital. My passion for medicine is how I resolve my intellectual curiosity along with my desire to do more. At the core of a physician’s work, is the devotion to do good and improve the quality of the patient’s life. With each of these experiences, I find that the values of a physician and the values that I hold close to me are identical. I aspire to gain the expertise as a physician to one day have the privilege of treating someone’s loved one without the feeling of helplessness. I truly can’t think of a better way to spend the rest of my life.","While in undergrad, I decided to go on a volunteer trip to serve in a homeless shelter in Atlanta‚Äôs bluff, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the country. I had the privilege of serving children in an after school program, working with employees on projects around the shelter, and serving meals to residents. The meaningful connections I made throughout that week with individuals of a totally different walk of life from me taught me that I can always express love and kindness no matter what difficulties I am going through._x000D_
_x000D_
After that experience, I decided to consistently serve at a local food pantry. Volunteering at the Vineyard Food Pantry allowed me to give back to the community and stay grounded. The visitors that came were always smiling even through their struggles. I learned from them that I could find joy in life‚Äôs simplest of pleasures. As a physician I would really love the opportunity to work in the community and help those that are less fortunate._x000D_
","In college, I had the opportunity to serve on the Morrill Scholars Program Advisory where I was the link between Ohio State‚Äôs administration and the scholars that have exemplified diversity and inclusion. Through this role I was given the responsibility of planning events for over 1500 students to engage in the community. I decided the best way to do this was to hold a community service involvement fair. We invited representatives from over 50 organizations in the Columbus and gave students the opportunity to make connections and create relationships that could last years._x000D_
_x000D_
Although indirect, I believe this was one of the biggest impacts I had on the community. Sometimes there is a divide with the university and the surrounding community. I was able to come up with a way to connect both together. This event has now become an annual occurrence and thousands of Ohio State students have benefitted by getting involved in the community. _x000D_

In August I moved to Florida to complete a master‚Äôs degree in medical sciences. When we started, the plan was to have online classes for two weeks and then transition to in-person classes. Unfortunately, that transition never happened and I completed my degree entirely online. With the lack of in-person interaction with professors and peers, it was difficult to build meaningful relationships, especially at a new school, city, and state. Overall, this pandemic has provided many barriers but has shown that flexibility, creativity, and resilience are key when faced with unprecedented challenges.",1,0,2

My excitement was palpable as I entered the Military Advanced Training Center (MATC), which is their physical and occupational therapy section. MATC is technologically stunning, with rooms of giant hydraulic platforms and sensor arrays. It is amazing how precise prosthetics need to be; each patient has different specifications which need to be tailored for. Observing these amputees training hard with their prosthetics is inspiring and moving, like watching miracles happen, as patients can be wheeled in one day, and walk in on another. At MATC I met Mark Marsico, an occupational therapist here. We are collaborating to use electromyography sensors to make a videogame controller for our amputees. This is particularly important because certain occupational therapy tools use specialized videogames. It is very exciting to collaborate with Mark on my prototype and will be even more so to see the faces of the soldiers as they use it. Meanwhile, even the day-to-day tasks are fulfilling. They give the simple joy of connecting to the stories of each patient.  It is a humbling and motivating experience to encounter the patients and the accomplished physicians who treat them. Volunteering here has moved me by reminding me of the impact that a career in medicine has to offer, and to not take my blessings for granted. 

The love of helping people and of technology is why I chose engineering as my pre-med path. Information technology is transforming medicine from big labs to family clinic, profoundly affecting everyone, and the trend is accelerating. This realization inspired my coursework and research. I earned my M.S., with a thesis on machine learning applications in neurology. Dr. Daniel Hier, my M.S. co-Advisor, is an inspiration to me, as a neurologist working with computer engineers to tackle what he calls the “thorny problems”. His exemplary career, as a clinician, educator, and researcher, encourages me to seek collaborative projects and a deeper understanding of both the medicine and data science disciplines. 

After earning my M.S., I returned to the National Institutes of Health for a postbac opportunity to use my machine learning skills for interdisciplinary collaboration.  I enjoyed my internship, so elected to continue my work with Dr. Marc Ghany, a hepatologist. We just submitted our first of what will be several papers on machine learning in hepatology. My clinical work with him involves quality of life surveys to patients on the clinical protocol, among other tasks. This gives me perspective into the lives of these patients, and I have grown in compassion, connection, and understanding as a result. Dr. Ghany is also an inspiration, through his breadth of clinical experience interacting with the hundreds of patients in his cohort. He has a deep sense of each patient, as well as the communities that these patients come from, which I tremendously admire and will continue to emulate. It is an honor and an obligation to continue this tradition. I continue to look for exciting opportunities to expand my clinical experiences, so I accepted the invitation to collaborate this December with Dr. Mason Cobb and Victoria Healthcare Systems in Vietnam, which treats 10,000 patients per month. This visit will expose me to the complexities of how an entire system supports the front-end mission of physicians and caregivers to provide the highest standard of care and respect for patients and their families. He also will arrange for me to help at government clinics, to see how dedicated professionals strive to do their best with even greater patient loads. 

I have always sought to improve the outlook of others around me, with my enthusiasm, scientific fascination, compassion, outgoing personality, and sense of humor all helping accomplish the job. As an undergraduate, I was passionate about the peer tutoring program, working for it all four years, developing improvements, and eventually becoming its student leader. For educators, it’s all about the students. For physicians, it’s all about the patients. This makes all the sacrifices worthwhile. While I understand that the journey to becoming a physician is demanding and will continually require ever-increasing effort, I am willing and determined to do what it takes. No matter where I end up, medical school can unite my desire to care for patients with my technological background to be well-equipped for future advances in health care. I also want to grow to know, love, and care for a community of people: perhaps soldiers like I do now at Walter Reed, or in a more rural setting like my hometown in Rolla, Missouri. It’s difficult for me to pick just one field, since I see the overlap between disciplines everywhere, and applications are potentially boundless. My goal is to advance medical practice by uniting a deep understanding of treatment with a broad range of engineering and scientific knowledge, appropriate for deploying technological advances for patients’ benefit. There are so many opportunities to use engineering advances to improve patient outcomes!","For many rural students, the multiculturalism in college is transformational. Although I have had friends from different cultures since childhood, college still opened new horizons. For example, I was treasurer of the Missouri S&T Fencing club. It has a very diverse set of members, with diversity in heritage and LGBTQ representation. I worked closely on budgets with our officer corps. The experience gave me an opportunity to hear and understand the perspectives of my fellow officers. Although Missouri S&T‚Äôs student population is diverse and accepting, the small, rural town it is in can feel isolating by its lack of diversity. Hearing their stories left me with a new perspective on my hometown and gave me insight into the importance of diversity. It is a great feeling to make a personal connection with someone and help them achieve more than they had thought possible. This is only possible with respect. It is the cornerstone of helping anybody, especially where teaching is concerned. ","At the start of the Fall 2019 semester, I was promoted to associate-head of Missouri S&T‚Äôs tutoring organization, consisting of 50 tutors. During this period, I was instrumental in switching the tutoring organization into an online-only format so that we could continue to function despite the COVID lockdowns. As things reopened, and I became head, I was able to improve the organization, making policy and infrastructure changes, which helps share the workload. We hired a superb associate head and I obtained permission to create another position, the communication officer, to monitor our email and social media, and update our weekly schedule on our official website. We met bi-weekly to discuss new initiatives and bounce ideas off each other for improving the organization, and we began more initiatives than any other previous administration. As a result, we reached more students and hired more tutors than ever before, greatly increasing our positive impact on our campus community. ",,,1,"COVID  prevented volunteering in a medical setting, as many places were not seeking volunteers. I am grateful that in the past year, I have had some more clinical experience through my assistance of the clinical protocol at the NIH and through my assistance at Walter Reed medical center. I am about to begin additional volunteering through Capital Caring, a hospice and pediatric organization located in Washington, DC, to gain additional breadth in my clinical experiences. These activities are helping me offset opportunities previously lost due to COVID-19. Even as recently as this Spring, COVID continued to disrupt my volunteer opportunities. I applied and was accepted to the aforementioned preceptorship in Vietnam, and had planned to go in March. I was very eager to help and learn. Then the U.S. State Department put Vietnam on a do-not-travel list, and Vietnam imposed a several-week quarantine. These required deferring the visit to December.",1,1,2

My eyes are heavy as I drag myself out of bed and put on my scrubs. Once I arrive at the dialysis clinic, I hurry to prep my machines before my patients arrive.

By 9:00 am, I’ve replaced a machine and cleaned blood off the floor. As I prepare Mr. Brown’s access, he scolds me for being lazy and slow. I can feel tears beginning to form, but I pause, take a breath, and focus on completing my tasks. Part of me questions why I choose to endure the stress, but then I remember I’m not the one suffering from a chronic disease. I don’t have to sit in a chair hooked up to a machine, for four hours a day, three times a week, getting pricked with needles and being told to restrict my diet. Holding Mr. Brown’s arm, I pick my target and carefully insert the needle under the skin. He flinches, makes a face, then lets out a sigh of relief. I am reminded that while dialysis is necessary for his survival, it can be a significant burden. As a physician, I want to comfort patients in the midst of their pain while being in charge of their medical care.

As the sounds of dialysis machines echo through the clinic, I wonder how Mr. Brown reached this point. I have learned some pathophysiology of kidney failure, and after completing a Masters in Nutrition I know that health is multidimensional. While volunteering at a community clinic, I saw patients whose ability to care for themselves was limited by time, money, and location. Unable to follow the recommendations of their provider, patients often felt lost. As Mr. Brown pulls out his standard breakfast, a sausage McMuffin, I sense a similar pattern. By reviewing his chart, I learn that his kidneys failed as a result of type 2 diabetes—now he depends on a machine to survive. Feeling this tension, I imagine myself as his doctor, going back in time, and maybe I could have prevented a lifetime of discomfort for Mr. Brown. On the other hand, maybe I would be powerless to change anything. At the very least, I want the chance to prevent this result for other people in similar circumstances. Even though I can’t change the outcome of Mr. Brown’s disease, I am grateful to provide the care that allows him to live another day. After his treatment is finished, Mr. Brown packs up his belongings and I wave him goodbye, knowing he’ll be back soon.

While dialysis does not cure, it was a curative experience that sparked my passion for medicine. I volunteered in rural Kenya with a team of surgeons from around the world. There I met a young Kenyan woman about my age. Her eyes were bloodshot, and on her neck was a goiter the size of a baseball. Her pain was not just physical, but deeply personal—she was expelled from school and ostracized by her community because they believed she was cursed. With nowhere to go, she reached out to our team. As I wheeled her into the operating room, I felt her squeeze my hand, so naturally I squeezed back. For a moment, I was no longer a stranger from across the world, but simply a human supporting a fellow human during a time of uncertainty. After the mass was removed, she repeated, “asante, asante”—“thank you, thank you”—relieved that her sense of belonging could be restored. Not only did this surgery change her life, but it also changed mine. In that moment, I realized the profound impact I could make as a physician.

When Mr. Brown returns to the clinic, the monotonous beeping continues. Across the room, I watch someone hurl into a red hazardous waste bag. I am reminded that medicine is not always glamorous or profound. As I grab a 15 gauge needle, the nurse tells me the doctor increased the needle size. I’m nervous about how Mr. Brown will respond; after working with him for months, I know he gets anxious prior to cannulation. Before he sits in the chair, I carefully lay out his blankets and turn on his favorite channel. As I inform him of this change, I remind him of our routine—deep breath, count to three, and make an ugly face. I finish my speech and prepare for the worst. His eyes widen. His voice is hesitant, but to my surprise, he replies by saying, “I trust you, Jordan.” A few days later, he walks in as if a weight was lifted off his chest. He was still sick, yet this small change helped to lighten the load. Even though the possibility of life-change drew me into medicine, it is the small wins that keep me here.

In the midst of the highs, the lows, and everything in between, I know a career in medicine will not always be enjoyable or even fulfilling. However, I was raised to value the life of every human being. We all experience pain and suffering. When comforting a vulnerable patient it helps me to remember the times I’ve felt scared, lonely, and powerless. At the end of the day, the same patient who calls me lazy and slow is someone’s father, sibling, and friend. The chance I have of easing someone’s burden is more than enough motivation for me to get up at 3:00 am, put on my scrubs, and get to work.","While serving in Kenya, there was a patient who arrived at our clinic with elephantiasis. As I guided him to the exam room, I could see significant swelling in his right leg which was constricted by the fabric of his jeans. This seemed very uncomfortable for him and I wondered why he chose to wear long pants instead of shorts. As his physician explained the dangers of restricting circulation, I remembered that Kenyan culture emphasizes modesty. Instead of asking this patient to wear shorts, his physician suggested he wear loose fitting trousers until he could travel to a clinic with better resources. While I was disappointed in the outcome of this case, I was reminded of how culture influences behavior. As a physician, I must be aware of the values and customs in my patient population. This experience not only improved my cultural awareness but it also encouraged me to be a provider that seeks to understand people from different backgrounds. ","As a volunteer at People‚Äôs Community Clinic, I educated patients on healthy diet and lifestyle behaviors. I remember one patient attended our class in hopes of improving her diet to help manage her diabetes. In addition, I learned that she came from a Hispanic family and grew up cooking meals that were associated with Mexican culture. She knew these traditional meals were bad for her blood sugar, however, she felt lost when it came to preparing healthier options. With this perspective, I showed her how to make healthier versions of the foods she loved. By choosing whole wheat tortillas, prioritizing beans over rice, and limiting foods with added sugar, I helped improve her diet while still honoring her culture. In the end, I believe this approach was less intimidating and allowed for more sustainable change. As a physician, I want to collaborate with my patients and invite them to participate in their plan of care. This way, I can help them achieve better health.",,,1,"At the start of the pandemic, my classes moved online and my volunteer opportunities were suspended. In the meantime, I anxiously wondered how this would affect my dream of becoming a physician. _x000D_

Despite these worries, I looked for opportunities to help. I volunteered in virtual nutrition classes at People‚Äôs Community Clinic where I learned to appreciate telehealth technology and educate patients on diet and lifestyle. In addition, I worked part-time at Whole Foods Market while pursuing my graduate studies. I served my community by providing floral arrangements during some of life's most difficult moments.

I tuned my ears to the orchestra’s melody, staying in rhythm and matching the colors of the string and woodwind sections. Throughout the 13-minute piece, I told the story of a hero defending his land against an imposing army. Growing up, playing the piano was my favorite hobby. I looked forward to learning new challenging pieces and telling stories through my performances. Upon constructing each “story” and learning each piece, I learned that there is always room for improvement, whether by articulating a trill more or adjusting the tempo of a melody. Yet, what I appreciate most about my journey with the piano is how I can apply the motto of continual improvement to my daily routine.
This passion for improvement guided me as I ventured a few thousand miles away for college to explore my interest in healthcare originating from my time as a hospital volunteer in high school. As I learned about Asian and Pacific Islander health through volunteering with Asian Pacific Health Corps, I grew particularly interested in preventative care and health equity. At our free health fairs, I translated for Cantonese- and Mandarin-speaking patients. One was a fifty-four year-old woman who lacked health insurance and had not seen a physician in many years. From our mammography to bone density station, she sought to utilize every health service. After checking her cholesterol levels, she spoke with Dr. Lin at the Physician Consultation station. “Your cholesterol levels are abnormal,” I translated and continued to convey the doctor’s concern for her risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Surprised by her results and worried that this could lead to a downward spiral in her health, she asked what to do. We consoled her by recommending lifestyle changes, such as dietary changes and increased exercise, and statin medications to help lower her cholesterol. With multiple options available, she could decide what she felt most comfortable doing to improve her health. The physician placed his hand on her shoulder and told her that everything was going to be alright. Despite the language barrier between them, the woman felt hope. “Thank you,” she repeated in Cantonese as she bowed her head at us. Observing Dr. Lin’s interactions with service recipients like that woman, I was amazed at the positive impacts his abilities in assessing their health, diagnosing their concerns, and counseling had on them. Translating for him taught me that bettering one’s health involves not only forming a personalized treatment plan, but also offering prophylactic measures that can avoid exacerbating conditions. I aspire to be like Dr. Lin and provide quality care, especially for under-resourced individuals.
Upon graduating from UCLA, I began scribing at urgent care clinics to encounter a wider array of medical conditions and learn more about providers’ medical decision making strategies. Working with ER providers, I completed their charts, allowing them to focus on seeing patients and improving their healthcare experiences. Challenging myself to grow as a leader and wanting to better more patients’ healthcare experiences, I am also establishing a scribe program for outpatient clinics at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Working with attendings in different specialties has been an exciting preview of medical school, and I have learned about new medical conditions in different areas of medicine and basic management. Upon seeing patients such as ones who sustained open fractures, I have even been able to learn more about the continuity of care for patients who are referred to specialists. In departments such as orthopedic surgery, attendings have struggled to balance completing notes and seeing patients on time. Weaving in the scribe’s role, I have helped attendings focus more of their time on patients by taking down the details of their histories. With the attendings spending less time taking notes at the computer and more time with their patients, parents have even had more satisfaction with their child’s care.
Throughout my undergraduate career and gap years, I have learned that medicine aligns with my own values of seeking improvement and desire to solve patients’ health concerns. From specific trills to the underlying rhythm, there are different parts to a piano piece that I can personalize and refine. Likewise, a physician’s role is to continually improve their patient’s health through lifestyle modifications, prescriptions, counseling, and education. Inspired by my experiences, I want to play a direct role in caring for patients while participating in community outreach to tackle health inequities and increase access to care. Just as I have fine-tuned my trills on the piano, I long to develop my knowledge and skills for a lifelong career of healing where I can listen to others’ needs and walk with them on their journey to better health.","The teenage girl sat on the examination table with her arms crossed as she saw me and the physician walk in. She had previously undergone a gender affirmation procedure, and she was upset that her recent progress notes still addressed her by her former name and male pronouns. I apologized for the oversight and although it was the first follow-up note I created for her, I completely corrected her chart. My encounter with the transgender girl taught me that being addressed by a former name can be similar to being called an insulting nickname. It can make you feel invalidated and even dismiss the person you are. In medicine, it can even cause one to lose trust in their providers. As a future physician, I long to promote an inclusive environment for others and serve as an ally even for those I may not identify with. Ultimately, I plan to advocate for their needs and hope to improve the healthcare experience where everyone can feel respected and safe regardless of their background.","Working with Asian Pacific Health Corps (APHC) to host free health fairs for underserved Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Los Angeles allowed me to combat these populations‚Äô health disparities. I offered Cantonese and Mandarin translational services, and promoted preventive health by educating patients about topics like healthy diets and diabetes to increase health literacy. I also compiled and distributed lists of local low-cost specialty clinics, so patients knew how to access resources to follow up on their chronic conditions. These experiences taught me how communication and fiscal gaps prevented these individuals from relaying their needs or even accessing care. It was fulfilling to help community members better understand their health and the importance of preventive screenings, and I want to apply my experiences with APHC to overcome similar barriers to care that burden vulnerable communities on Chicago‚Äôs West Side, such as unsheltered and uninsured ethnic minorities.",,,1,"I had difficulty finding employment after graduating during the onset of the pandemic since I did not receive responses from employers or was informed of delays in hiring. Due to restrictions, I could not continue conducting research and all club events were canceled. Despite these shortcomings, the opportunity to volunteer on the frontlines at a testing site showed me how the pandemic has exacerbated health disparities, such as how a lack of understanding of the virus led to lifestyle habits that unknowingly worsened minority health outcomes. Moreover, working as an urgent care scribe showed me how misinformation can impact one‚Äôs health, such as developing antibiotic resistance due to believing that antibiotics can treat viral infections. I strive to build on my prior experiences to increase health literacy and dispel misinformation to improve population health even during public health crises.",1,0,2

As a first-generation, low-income student, I was initially clueless about studying for college-level classes. For example, when I was a high school sophomore, I was offered the opportunity to take AP classes that would allow me to get a head start on earning college credit.

Each day after dinner and hours of watching Al Jazeera Sudan News, I carried this box along with notes I took at his doctor’s appointments, reading them as he patiently sat on the living room couch. “Take two a day with food and make sure you take it with water and not chai, alright baba?” I read to my dad as he gazed at me, amused by my almost perfect English pronunciations. My father drank his Sudanese tea so religiously that the doctor often encouraged me to occasionally remind him to drink water. 

From a young age, I made many such recommendations from the doctor to my father following several open-heart surgeries. I found serious joy and purpose in gaining my dad’s trust to guide him with medical decision making. As the most fluent English speaker in an immigrant Sudanese household of ten, I took on the responsibility of escorting my father to every appointment. Like many immigrants in the U.S., my dad dreaded speaking English in public out of fear that others would judge his accent or assume he was incapable of understanding.Witnessing the effects of these barriers in my father’s experiences with the healthcare system helped me truly understand the importance of cultural humility in medicine - these moments shaped my desire to serve, advocate, and empower immigrant communities to be active stakeholders in their health outcomes.

Through my experiences as a clinical research associate at Washington University, I recognized that my family is not alone in their struggle to access equitable healthcare. I saw the concrete ways in which the socioeconomic background of the patients that I met determined healthcare outcomes as much as their genetic predispositions did. As a Black woman, it was heart-wrenching to witness firsthand how healthcare barriers disproportionately affect people of color, reflecting centuries of institutionalized racism in America directly impacting patients to this day. One woman confided in me that she was suffering from domestic abuse from her partner yet simply did not have the finances to escape and live independently. She made clear that she never felt comfortable reaching out for help out of fear of retaliation. Yet, when I pressed her to call the local crisis nursery, she put her faith in my advice for one simple reason: I reminded her of one of her closest childhood friends. I was happy that I was able to gain her trust through sharing a similar narrative of the Black Female experience. The demographics amongst medical professionals need to reflect society’s diverse population to lend unique perspectives and build trust amongst communities, particularly those of color. Trust saves lives.

I had similarly meaningful experiences during my time recruiting in the WashU COH3 OBGYN clinic, which primarily served young Medicaid recipient mothers. Having been raised in a low-income household myself allowed me to easily understand and connect with my patients. The relationships I built while working in research not only helped me connect vulnerable mothers to resources such as the crisis nursery, but allowed me to bridge the gap of understanding between communities of color and medicine. Using my fluent Arabic skills, I communicated with refugee mothers from various African and Middle Eastern countries– some who for the first time were receiving prenatal care– to simplify medical terminology and emphasize the importance of adhering to their medical team’s plan. This minor exchange of knowledge and compassion resulted in improved outcomes for our mothers who often expressed gratitude for their ability to access the clinic.

These experiences reinforced the importance of cultural sensitivity and solidified my passion for medicine, allowing me to recognize that I want to serve through a lens of understanding. Through familial and clinical exposure, I discovered that medicine is not solely about understanding the science behind treatments but also about human dignity and establishing genuine relationships, based on trust, by recognizing and respecting each other’s differences. When a patient's holistic needs are met in an unjudged way, they are more likely to feel comfortable and trust their physician, leading to improved health outcomes. I am motivated to provide this type of culturally sensitive care with respect to the patient's core values, beliefs, and experiences. I want them to entrust me with their blue box, as my dad trusted me to assume the role of his caregiver. In retrospect, I feel humbled that my dad trusted me with something as important as his health - I eagerly await the day when, as a physician, I’ll be entrusted with the same honor to establish the same connection with my patients.","Throughout my life, I lived in communities lacking resources people often take for granted, such as in war-torn Sudan, where scarcity permeated every aspect of life from healthcare to education. Even after gaining refugee status to move to the US, my family‚Äôs struggles were never entirely mitigated. In retrospect, I now recognize that we were directly impacted by the consequences of poverty, where our socioeconomic status determined the extent to which we could pursue a dignified life. Although these experiences were harrowing, they fundamentally fueled my desire to serve others as a culturally competent physician-advocate, especially for those facing various forms of discrimination and insecurity.  My upbringing across several countries introduced me to various backgrounds and cultures, which taught  me to always keep an open mind. These experiences formed my identity and, I believe, can provide unique perspectives to discussions regarding diversity and advocacy with my classmates.","The alarming maternal mortality rate for Black women is an issue that galvanizes me to ensure equitable access to medicine. They face the highest pregnancy-related deaths and complications compared to all racial groups, independent of socioeconomic status. In my clinical experiences, I often encountered Black mothers who shared their fears regarding delivering due to previous negative birthing experiences they heard about or experienced themselves. I listened and empathized with the moms and through various tough conversations I helped empower them to advocate for their needs. They would often express gratitude for the support they received. As a Black woman and future physician, this disparity is profoundly alarming and drives me to help close racial and gender gaps that should not exist in modern medicine. I look forward to the prospect of serving the diverse Chicago west side neighborhoods to address health disparities existing for Black and all underserved and disadvantaged groups.",,,1,"The abrupt transition to remote-learning forced me back into my parents‚Äô crowded home and lack of a study space and stable internet access made focusing an arduous task. I keenly felt the loss of being on campus, which provided an optimal learning environment. Altogether, these factors severely impacted my ability to study for classes and prepare for the MCAT. I also started working 3-4 jobs to pay tuition and support my family. Although unplanned, I ultimately decided to take gap years to submit the best application possible by studying for the MCAT and gaining additional clinical experiences. Although this time was strenuous, I realized the pandemic only highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing health and socioeconomic disparities for communities of color. By experiencing these disparities first-hand, I know it is crucial for physicians to advocate for solutions to structural inequities so that everyone can achieve better health outcomes independently of their socioeconomic status.",1,1,2

Given the time zone, I found myself propped up in front of a Zoom call at 3AM, rubbing my bleary eyes with one hand and downing a mug of coffee with the other.
But that didn’t matter then. Nothing took precedence over caring for my grandmother, who suffered from a stroke the previous summer. The situation was too reminiscent of my grandfather’s passing when I was ten. Unfamiliar with death, I remember spending hours at the hospital mortuary as my mother accepted condolences. Seeing her trembling, withholding tears as visitors laid snow-white chrysanthemums by the casket, was enough to make me understand how difficult goodbyes could be. It was then, with the naïve notion that I could always prevent early deaths as a doctor, that my 10-year-old-self resolved to study medicine.
It wasn’t until years later at UCLA, however, that my academic interest in the human body truly blossomed. Bolstered by brilliant physiology professors, I found myself endlessly fascinated with the human body. Yet, I wasn’t content with physiological knowledge alone; I wanted to apply my education clinically to serve my community.
This led me to seek out volunteer experiences in preventive health, one of which was providing EKGs to patients like Kyle at heart screenings. Despite the technician’s explanation that the process was painless, the child’s stoic expression and rigid posture told me he was unconvinced. So, while his mother filled out forms, I took the opportunity to show him the EKG leads were painless, repeatedly attaching and detaching the electrodes on my forearm in a slapstick comedic fashion. Still unconvinced, I then handed one over to him so he could verify it himself. Success. After fiddling with it for a bit, Kyle slowly brightened up, which told me I had alleviated his doubts.
Not long after, I noticed another patient fidgeting and glancing elsewhere instead of completing her health questionnaire. Seeing as she was anxious, I peeked at her chart and found that her surname was ""Park”. Recognizing this as possibly a Korean surname, I asked if she needed help with translations. Upon confirming, her relief was immediately apparent from her smile; her English-proficient son had stepped away to take a call, leaving her to fill out the form alone. Reassured that I would help translate, she completed the form and proceeded to take her EKG.
Even if I didn’t interpret the EKGs myself, I felt truly fortunate and elated to have played a role in detecting signs of heart disease, especially after hearing that two of the patients we screened that day had EKGs indicating atrial fibrillation. Although I don’t know if Kyle or Ms. Park were included in the two, I found these experiences to highlight the value of human interactions in medicine. Something as simple as acting on nonverbal cues can move patients to place their faith in me, enabling me to convey my compassion and commitment to my community.
Unfortunately, these exchanges were cut short by the pandemic. With in-person interactions out of the picture, I redirected my efforts to serve my community another way: teaching.
Globally, students struggled to navigate their coursework over Zoom, which was especially apparent in my section when I first relocated to Seoul to care for my grandmother. It only took five minutes to gauge that my students didn’t understand membrane transport despite an impending midterm. Suspecting this was due to the dense language of textbooks, I transformed the endless paragraphs into digestible flowcharts, which, judging from their responses, seemed to help. For those still lost, I reassured them that they only didn’t understand “yet”. I always emphasized the “yet” to foster a growth mindset, and that I would help them get there even if it was 3AM from across the globe. As a student myself, I knew how difficult Zoom classes could be, so I committed to teaching in the hopes of not only helping students understand the material, but also building up their confidence.
Needless to say, I was thrilled when my students made progress, knowing I had contributed to their growth. This joy I felt from teaching only solidified my conviction to become a physician, as doctors are essentially teachers. I realized I could repackage the complex science of the human body into feasible steps my patients can take to recover. And, for patients that feel hopeless in the face of their illness or injury, I hope to nurture growth mindsets to spur progressive thoughts that can greatly influence their path to recovery.
What started as an innocent goal to prevent all goodbyes matured into a desire to pursue a career in which I can accompany patients in their journey to improve their health. As a physician, I hope to leverage my experiences to deliver comfortable care to my patients, ultimately striving to prolong their time with their loved ones. From easing my patients’ anxiety to instilling hope in their recovery, I aspire to empower my patients to take control of their health through heart-to-heart interactions and medical practices.","I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting my grandmother to say when my mom sliced her finger with a knife, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúBRING THE SOJU!‚Äù._x000D_
Turns out it was a Korean folk remedy to pour drinking alcohol over wounds. Evidently this was questionable, but at 9 years old, I didn‚Äôt dare challenge my grandmother. In Korean filial piety, talking back to elders would equate to a cardinal sin._x000D_
As I grew, however, I learned to use this upbringing to interact with people different from myself, especially at work. For example, to eliminate misinformation in low-income communities, I pulled from my experiences to first respect their beliefs, then kindly inform them their understanding was actually inaccurate, and finish with explaining the proper care for their concern. This allowed me to correct the patients without provoking them._x000D_
Given Chicago‚Äôs diverse population, I hope to leverage my experiences to navigate patients‚Äô diverse beliefs, ultimately empowering them to lead healthy lifestyles.","While working with local Asian communities in free health fairs to promote healthy cardiovascular lifestyles, I realized that a huge contributing factor to misinformation was language barriers. As important as it was to get blood pressure and body mass index readings, the efforts would be in vain if the patient didn‚Äôt understand what the results signified._x000D_
That‚Äôs why I primarily volunteered as a translator on- and off-site. During health fairs, I would help providers translate lifestyle recommendations and deliver educational presentations in the community‚Äôs native language on varying health topics. Outside of health fairs, I would draft and translate informational pamphlets for patients to take home for future reference. I felt fulfilled in contributing to health literacy by making accurate information accessible to non-English-speaking patients, and I hope to continue supporting their control over their health in the future as a physician.",,,1,"I knew from my second year onwards that I wanted to take a gap year to gain clinical experiences while applying to medical school.

As the device counted down, I remember feeling helpless as I sensed tension building in the room. I was nervous and scared, holding back tears as I watched my worried mom observe every moment. Leading up to this moment, I had been feeling sick, but I did not register its severity as a nine-year-old. When the doctor informed me of my new health status, a person with Type I diabetes, I struggled to understand what this meant and how it would impact my future. Although my doctor said I was lucky that my disease was manageable, any sense of luck eluded me as they explained my new responsibilities. I remember feeling overwhelmed and helpless as I tried to understand, retain, and execute the complex instructions that would keep me alive. 

Though I did not know it then, my visits with my endocrinologist planted the seed that eventually grew into my unwavering desire to become a doctor. My appointments with her were much different from my other doctor experiences because I felt like I was in an environment where I could learn from and talk openly about my mistakes without judgment. I appreciated that I was included in conversations regarding changes to my basal insulin levels and carbohydrate rations and loved feeling like an active participant in my diabetes journey. As my diabetes care skills improved, I started visiting with my endocrinologist less frequently. During gaps between visits, I began to look forward to my appointments with her because of how she made me feel when I was there. My younger self understood that doctors were knowledgeable, kind, and caring. But, as I matured around my medical condition, I appreciated the more significant impact a doctor can have on someone's life. This realization fueled my passion for becoming a doctor because I want to provide quality care for someone like my endocrinologist did for me. 

My dad constantly reinforced the importance of managing my disease, which required maintaining a close relationship with an endocrinologist. As my best friend, he never wanted me to feel apprehensive about seeking medical care. Once I entered high school, my dad's concern for me became apparent as he opened up about his personal health journey. In our few discussions about this sensitive topic, he explained that his physical condition was considered morbidly obese by medical standards. I felt that this assessment was an unforgiving definition of my dad. When he explained how he thought there was a barrier between him and his doctor because of his physical condition, I sensed a sadness in his voice. I also remembered feeling surprised that he had such a different relationship with his doctor compared to the one I had with my endocrinologist. 

Tragically, my dad suddenly passed away at age 55 from undiagnosed colon cancer. His death was likely due to him not abiding by routine medical screenings because of the barriers he felt. I was a senior in high school, and our conversations about his doctor experiences were still fresh in my mind. As I sat beside him in his hospital bed, watching his lips turn the slightest shade of blue and his heart rate decrease, I remember feeling many emotions. I felt scared, helpless, and uncertain about what the future held. As more time passed, the fear was replaced with feelings of devastation and then anger. I constantly questioned the circumstances surrounding his death. Nobody deserves to feel how he did about seeking medical care. The loss of my dad further ignited my interest in becoming a doctor because families should not lose a loved one in a similar way to how I lost my dad. My desire to limit patient apprehension in seeking medical care has been a constant driver in my journey to becoming a doctor. 

Motivated by my life experiences, I decided to immerse myself in clinical care. While in college, I volunteered at a local hospital on the pediatric floor. During one of my shifts, the nurses assigned me to help them care for a baby who had just undergone surgery and was challenging to console. While holding her, I sensed that she was scared. I cradled her, and within minutes, her body relaxed, and she began to sleep. As she calmed down, I felt myself do the same as we bonded. I remembered the interactions with my endocrinologist when I was scared as I cared for the baby. As I connected with her, my aspiration to become a doctor strengthened. I felt hindered by my inability to provide care beyond simply holding her, despite my desire to limit her stress and uneasiness. I aspired to have a doctor's knowledge and expertise to provide the highest quality care for the baby. 

The culmination of my life events has clarified my unwavering desire to practice medicine. I aspire to become a person with the knowledge and training needed to guide patients in their care and treat others' ailments. As a doctor, I will work tirelessly to effectively manage a nine-year-old's stress around her medical conditions, reduce a dad's apprehension about seeking care, and console a baby in need.","During my undergraduate college career, I worked in Dr. John Cronan's laboratory, where many international students from China were employed. As a result, my daily interactions and work partnership with one member, Yuan, set up a fertile learning environment about Chinese culture and norms. Because English was not her first language, it was often challenging to communicate with her effectively. In our work-related conversations, I learned to add non-verbal communication, such as hand gestures and facial expressions, to exchange information. _x000D_
 _x000D_
Based on this, I have learned that what makes people human goes across all cultures and ethnicities. I recognize that dealing with others is not letting the language barrier impact how well communication happens. As a Medical Assistant, I handle patients every day who come from different backgrounds than my own, and I work hard to display empathy and kindness towards them. What I have learned will influence me when I provide care as a physician.","Due to my performance in the Master of Science in Medical Physiology program, I was selected to become a Peer Educator for Post-baccalaureate Admission Program (PAP) scholars at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine (UIC COM). PAP scholars are students who are underrepresented in medicine (URM) and complete a year-long program in anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry before entering medical or dental school. During their Summer Prematriculation Program (SPP) session in 2022, I had the opportunity to support their efforts in studying high-yield concepts in anatomy and related clinical cases. My commitment assisted them in gaining the knowledge and self-confidence required for success upon entering medical or dental school. As a result of tutoring my students, I had the opportunity to impact the communities where many of these future doctors will practice. I look forward to continuing these efforts during the 2022-2023 academic year.

As a medical volunteer in the rural Dominican Republic, I am overwhelmed by the absolute burden of infectious disease in the community. Many Haitian immigrants within the country lack proper healthcare due to ethnic prejudice and insufficient infrastructure. As I assist with triage, I feel their depression and intuit their fear. I pause momentarily to regain my composure and begin to contemplate what a mentor once told me. ""Look for life,"" he said. And so, within the sea of patients surrounding me, I find laughter and love. I feel unity and hope, and through their anguish...I gather my strength.
  
   Working as a medical research volunteer, I saw the effects of social determinants on marginalized communities. I gained insight as I witnessed families navigating through barriers set to minimize or eliminate their access to healthcare. One young Haitian mother from a rural community of Baraguana brought her children to me, who were malnourished and suffering from a parasitic infection. Disheveled and feeling defeated, this mother was all too familiar with rejection due to her socioeconomic status. My heart broke as she described, with pleading eyes and a broken voice, her children's preventable illness, calling it a ""death sentence."" As I continued my assessment and time passed, I watched as her anxiety dissipated and the color returned to her face. She informed me that this was the first time that she and her children had been treated with compassion. Within medicine, compassionate care is the hallmark of implementing a holistic approach to healthcare. The role of empathy is multifaceted and serves as a bridge to address inadequacies in patient care. 

   Breaking down the intricacies of medicine and public health for patients allowed me to connect on a deeper level with the community. Understanding their experiences with healthcare through their stories taught me the importance of viewing people as more than their illness. Listening to the woman's story about her physical and social struggles exemplified the importance of an empathetic approach to care. I saw the joy my mentor had told me to look for in the community. The close relationships within Baraguana were critical to bridging the gap in health care access and provided a sense of community for individuals invisible to society. Practicing medicine goes beyond simply making a diagnosis or prescribing a medication. It involves forming a human connection as a form of empowerment. 

   Growing up in a rural community of 6,000 people, I am all too familiar with the stigma surrounding those socioeconomically disadvantaged. Not only is healthcare restricted or unavailable to those living in poverty, but the cycle of negligence in some communities results in homelessness, addiction, malnutrition, and crime. My early exposure to the silent, invisible unfortunate inspired me to become involved. As a Community Development Intern for United Way, I partnered with local doctors to develop Medicaid and public health outreach programs. Our team hosted fairs to provide education and resources to individuals struggling with housing and food insecurity. Through a direct connection to physicians, low-income families could voice their struggles within the community obtaining care. Approaching healthcare through this lens revealed to me the importance of patient-centered medicine and an avenue for doctors to assist in rebuilding a sense of agency within marginalized populations. It is essential for physicians to protect and serve their community by addressing social factors that influence health. 
   
   My work at the molecular epidemiology lab (WHO Collaborating Center for Onchocerciasis Diagnostics) has inspired me to continue to pursue the ability to utilize clinical research to address social determinants of health, including but not limited to combating outbreaks in endemic regions. Collaborating with international researchers, I developed cost-effective, efficient, and portable assays for communities. Inaccurate testing models have proven devastating, leading to diagnostic errors and increased disease prevalence. Overall, working with the WHO allowed me to translate research beyond the lab and directly to the patients' bedsides. Approaching research from a human perspective in data provides an avenue for greater research efficacy and insight into health advocacy. 

As a physician, my passion is to focus on my patients holistically, centering on health equity, quality of life, and patient independence. Looking back at the journey that drew me to medicine, I am confident that my experiences have shaped my desire and ability to provide vulnerable populations with public health resources to improve their quality of life. Practicing medicine goes beyond simply making a diagnosis or prescribing a medication. In the future, I hope to apply the lessons that have shaped me to utilize research and patient care to connect and educate patients to provide an integrated and empathetic approach to care.","As a frontline healthcare worker performing research in the Dominican Republic, my mentor taught me to look for life in communities. Working in clinics allowed me to observe healthcare discrimination firsthand. Serving as a Clinic Coordinator, I led healthcare workers in rural communities, providing marginalized populations with primary care services. Conducting clinics in rural communities, I worked with Haitian immigrants lacking equitable access to care. Through this, I witnessed many patients disheveled and defeated due to years of neglect. Understanding their experiences with healthcare through their stories taught me the importance of viewing people as more than their diagnosis and seeing life in every patient. Community health's role in disrupting cycles of neglect in healthcare revealed that physicians could do more than treat patients' ailments. I hope to use these lessons to advocate, educate, and empower communities. _x000D_
","Studying the effect of infrastructure on waterborne diseases allowed me to witness health disparity research directly informing health intervention. I connected with communities to design solutions that mitigate health inequities, broadening my understanding of what it means to be a caregiver. In doing so, I collaborated directly with communities to analyze waterborne disease burdens in rural immigrant communities. Along with this, I facilitated focus groups with communities and developed educational programs to increase health literacy. Working alongside community leaders provided insight and helped me become a community member. I created educational curricula and health services reflective of the community's needs. This project determined the overarching disease burden within rural communities and identified the causes of the outbreak.

The sciences had always fascinated me and my older brother, Alex. Although Alex was headed to medical school and towards a career in medicine, I remained uncertain.  

My relationship with healthcare was complicated. Growing up in an agricultural community of Latinx immigrants, I witnessed the stress my parents endured with health-related issues. I'll never forget the day my mother decided to use the pharmacy's drive-thru window. Unable to communicate in English to the pharmacist's satisfaction, even with the help of Alex's interpretation from the passenger seat, he humiliated my mother's inability to speak English in front of us. Alex sat with his fists balled, tears rolled down my mom's cheeks, and I felt wounded and angry with a painful knot filling the back of my throat. I was only seven but dreaded these interactions that belittled our dignity. My parents had no choice but to endure such challenges in seeking healthcare. Limited insurance meant limited access to scheduled appointments, and an urgent visit required lining up at the community clinic early in the morning, giving only a possible chance to be seen. If we were lucky to get through the doors, my siblings and I were expected to interpret words and phrases that seemed equally confusing and foreign in English and Spanish. My experiences withered my dignity and left a subtle bitterness toward healthcare; It ultimately pushed me away from dreaming of a career in medicine. 

Despite these early experiences, my relationship with medicine changed on Veteran's Day weekend in 2016. I was a college freshman and home for the holiday - the same weekend my epileptic uncle stayed with us. I'd known since childhood how to recognize and respond to his mild seizures. I was never prepared for the severity of the episode that ensued. His face became blank, and his body vigorously jerked, grunting infant-like murmurs. I felt immensely helpless as I sat beside his unconscious body. Standing next to his bed in the ICU was my first experience with hospital medicine. I was stunned to witness the choreography of caring and competence of Dr.S. I deeply felt the power of a physician to protect human dignity and support the patient and the family when death seemed acutely possible. By the time my uncle was discharged, I had developed an overwhelming sense of gratitude towards Dr.S and a newfound respect for the transformative power of medicine.

With my newfound encouragement in medicine, Alex encouraged me to join Clinica Tepati, a non-profit health organization serving underserved Latinx communities in Sacramento. Not long after joining, I prepared an intake sheet for a concerned mother, ""Rosa,"" whose son, ""Julio,"" had cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy. I couldn't help but feel a wave of emotion wash over me. Old memories flooded my mind as I recorded Julio's blood pressure. I could see in them the hardships my family, especially my mother and uncle, had faced. But it wasn't until she shared that Tepati was the only clinic willing to help them due to their immigrant status that I realized my past experiences served as a scaffold for the help I could provide. My background, language, and story allowed Rosa to be seen and heard in a way my family rarely was. By interpreting her problems in their truest form, the medical student and attending physician I worked with responded with sincere compassion. At Clinica Tepati, I found a unique opportunity to offer the connection and understanding I believe all patients deserve. For the first time, I envisioned the larger effect I might have as a physician.

As I continued to explore a medical career, I was encouraged to explore scientific research through an undergraduate project in the Beal lab. My independent project related to a gene-editing protein called ADAR1, and I found the work fascinating and essential. I considered applying to MD-Ph.D. programs and excitingly joined Dr. Chan at UCSF as a research technician after college. This work has exposed me to CRISPR gene editing and its use to model patient-derived genetic mutations in mouse models to dissect the biology of underlying rare inherited diseases of the immune system. Aside from her extensive research mentorship, Dr. Chan has been an invaluable sounding board for my career ambitions. As an MD-Ph.D. herself, she's helped me understand where my passions lie and how I might navigate a career in medicine to feed my passions. Ultimately, I have realized my passion is for the human connection clinical medicine offers and the opportunity it affords to shape my community. 

Now, with clarity of purpose, I look back at my early experiences with healthcare as my greatest asset. I believe more than ever that the role of a physician must extend beyond simply treating an illness and must, instead, treat the human. This means taking on the responsibility to fight for health equity within a system where the underserved and marginalized are left to fall through the cracks. It's a responsibility I walk toward as I embark on a career in medicine.","As a Behavioral Technician(BT), I worked with kids diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD). I had yet to learn how to compassionately interact without triggering their specific ASD sensitivities._x000D_

On my first day, my enthusiastic ""hello!"" made nearby children wince. I quickly learned a few kids had Hyperacusis, an increased sensitivity to sound commonly diagnosed with Autism. I would continue to learn and refine my interactions when I first met ""Nate."" He sheltered himself away and despised social interaction.

Fortunately, my parent’s never-ending support of my constant engagement in extracurriculars eventually resulted in several scholarships to fund my undergraduate education. After graduating college as a first-generation, female, Hispanic student, I began to believe that with perseverance I could accomplish my goals. Now that I am the proud mother to a toddler, I have more reason to become a physician with the unique paradigm of being a parent. I am confident and excited in my decision to attend medical school and pursue a career as an academic physician scientist, diversifying the image of a physician while pulling others up through mentorship and contributing to the evolving medical field through basic science research.

I remember being in awe during my first exposure to the medical field where I was not seen as a patient or Spanish interpreter for family. While shadowing pediatric cardiologists at Children’s Hospital Colorado, I watched as they developed treatment plans for the most complex patients. I was fascinated by their medical knowledge and capability to improve others’ lives and captivated by their abilities to consider every detail of a patient’s history to develop the best plan for them. It was through programs aimed at increasing diversity in the medical field that I received these experiences, and I also realized becoming a physician provides ample opportunities to mentor future medical professionals as I had been mentored.

Most recently, I have spent time volunteering in a level 1 trauma center emergency department at the University of Colorado Hospital. I have enjoyed interacting with everyone in the department, from the patients and visitors, to the EMT’s, nurses, and physicians who are constantly working to improve everyone’s conditions. It impressed me how seamlessly the medical teams work together and watching the physicians determine complicated pathophysiology in seconds every time they walk into a new room inspires me to fulfill that leadership role. I observe physicians as they think critically about each patient they are treating; considering their histories, the missing information, and what additional resources they need to determine etiologies of their patient’s symptoms. I am even more inspired when I visit with patients; the comfort I can bring them by offering snacks, a warm blanket, or a conversation in either English or Spanish gives me the chance to build rapport quickly with patients I may never see again. Still, my motivations and curiosities extend beyond the clinical role of a physician.

I was first introduced to bench research as an undergraduate working in an infectious disease laboratory where I completed a research thesis based on my findings. There, I became excited about basic science and how it can inform and inspire clinical therapies. Learning the physiology of tuberculosis allowed me to think critically about the history of therapies and how we can improve treatments at the bedside. I gained leadership skills by teaching lab techniques and overseeing other undergraduate students working in the laboratory. I quickly learned how rewarding mentoring can be through the interactions with trainees. These experiences ignited my passion for research as a form of extending the current boundaries of knowledge while inspiring others to carry on the torch after I graduated.

As a result of my drive and experience, I earned a position in Dr. Steve Abman’s Pediatric Heart and Lung Center where I currently work with Dr. Erica Mandell. I have continued pursuing my passion in research, contributing to several manuscripts including a first author manuscript based on my novel work. I have also been responsible for designing, optimizing and conducting novel experimental rodent and cell culture models. After expanding my repertoire on basic research techniques, I shared this knowledge with several trainees in the lab, ranging from high school volunteers, medical students, residents, graduate students and post-graduate fellows. My experiences in presenting at conferences have helped develop my skill with scientific presentation while showing me how other physician scientists are contributing to the field of neonatology. Our lab collaborates with various departments both on campus and nationally. This multidisciplinary approach allows me to appreciate the unique contributions that enhance the overall understanding of the physiology of lung development. These experiences have helped me realize science and medicine are two sides of the same coin and I look forward to a career where I can do both as an academic physician scientist.

Having reflected on these experiences, I feel confident in my decision to attend medical school and pursue a career as an academic physician scientist. I will understand the struggle my patients or mentees will be going through as mothers, children of immigrants, or people living on less in the US. Moreover, I understand the value of having experiences as a clinician and a researcher. Ultimately, I want to push the field forward by becoming an academic physician scientist.","Since volunteering at the University of Colorado Hospital, I have been exposed to the need for diverse and multilingual medical providers who reflect patient populations. The immediate relief and trust I experience when I interact with Hispanic patients makes me feel like they know I am supporting their efforts in healing. As a child of immigrants, I understand the responsibility that comes with learning a new language and culture. When interacting with patients different from myself, I am open to hearing their stories; everyone has their own struggles and experiences. I believe it‚Äôs important to consider each patient individually; combining their history, context, and current evidence to treat them using precision medicine. These experiences have made me certain in my aspirations to become an academic physician scientist, where I will be an advocate for both patients and medicine to decrease mistrust in medicine and improve health disparities among vulnerable patient populations.","Growing up in Aurora, CO, I have always been exposed to diversity. My high school alone comprised of students representing over 90 countries. This foundation in recognizing and celebrating differences encouraged me to apply for a Resident Assistant (RA) position when I entered college. My first year as an RA, I was tasked with providing resources to a floor of international graduate students. Although initially intimidated, I earned each student‚Äôs respect by providing a welcoming and supportive environment. I was also grateful for my multilingual skills. I encouraged them to consider their privileges in our society and recognize institutional racism. By the end of that year, students were regularly inviting me to hot pots, sharing their stories and asking me for resources when they were struggling. These experiences have instilled a sense of openness and understanding when I interact with people; skills that will be advantageous as an academic physician scientist.",,,1,"I was seven months pregnant when notified I had to quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2023,15008367,,25,Man,USA,0,,0,0,,U,0,1,"Two incidents in college showed my immaturity, and I have learned a lot from them.

One night in freshman fall, I started drinking after failing a math midterm. I wanted to forget my frustration and sadness after working so hard, yet coming up short. I had many mixed drinks, and after vomiting for a few hours, an RA called 911. Although the EMTs determined that I did not need to go to the hospital, this incident was irresponsible, and it will not happen again.

Before college, I had little experience with alcohol and did not understand responsible drinking. Since then, I have learned to count drinks and not have drinks made with unknown amounts of alcohol. More importantly, I realized that alcohol is an inappropriate response to a life setback.

During my summer after sophomore year, I lent a friend my student ID so he could use the gym. My friend was stopped at the front desk and not allowed in. I met with an administrator, who said another incident like this could result in losing my gym access. I realized how significant my action was; if everyone shared their ID cards, safety would be jeopardized.

These instances show that I did not appreciate my privileged position as a college student. I need to act responsibly and think of others.",0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,4677,225.0,400.0,600.0,,152.0,1,1000,1,552,09/11/2020,Stanford University,Computer Science,0,,Yes,No,No,"$50,000 - 74,999",4,1,1,0,0.0,97.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,15,Significant,3,2023,2,5.0,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,"Silence, then soft crying. This was the reaction of a young mother, ""Nancy,"" after I told her that her infant son tested positive for COVID-19. I tried to comfort her, but when I realized she needed more than what I could provide, I told Nancy to call her son's pediatrician and that I would call back later. 

During the pandemic, I was a contact tracer. I called patients like Nancy to inform them of their test results, educate them on self-isolation, and gather close contacts. My favorite part of these calls was comforting patients, listening to their concerns, and answering questions. However, often there were questions only a doctor could answer, and I wished I could do more for these patients.

Wishing I could do more for someone was my initial motivation for medicine. As a child, I would see the drop of blood my grandfather Marvin had to prick from his finger to test his blood sugar; if it was too high, we worried about diabetes complications. My grandmother Nadine would then counsel him on his diet, just as she did for patients as a nurse. I wanted to treat Marvin's diabetes, and I understood that without insulin, my grandfather may not have been there to raise me.

Because of this, I always wanted to work in healthcare, for providing medical care to someone in need is inherently good. After learning to code, I wanted to contribute to medicine as an engineer; for example, by writing an algorithm to help doctors diagnose cancer. In college, though, I realized engineering is not the role I wanted: most engineering takes years to make a difference in someone's life, and I also like working with people. As I pondered my future, several memories came to me one night. I thought of my fascination with dissecting a pig heart in high school, the comfort I felt when a medical student stitched a cut on my face, and my long-held desire to treat my grandfather's diabetes. I wondered if I should become a doctor.

I began shadowing in an emergency department to answer this question. Each shift, I saw the staff touch lives in a way that is only possible in medicine. I witnessed, for example, an orthopedist use his fingers to guide the fractured tibia of a patient, ""Jose,"" back into place. Out of all the staff, only a doctor could do this closed reduction, and without this procedure, Jose's leg would never have healed. There was no way I could achieve this through code. I realized that I am drawn to the human aspect of medicine; what I am searching for would not be found in coding but at the patient's bedside. I should be a doctor, not an engineer, I concluded.

After college, I needed time to heal from an anxiety disorder that I developed during the pandemic. I also wanted to make healthcare more accessible through telemedicine. I spent months at a startup, Comet Healthcare, building a website where new mothers could access physical therapy for conditions like incontinence. Despite my efforts, we did not achieve our goals, and I left because I did not have the skills that Comet needed. Working at Comet, though, made me experience first-hand a lesson I learned in college. As an engineer, I can make a difference on a large scale. However, this comes at the cost of seeing a difference in one person's life. Thus, engineering is not as meaningful to me as working with patients. 

This lesson was particularly true in the case of ""John,"" a man who called a suicide hotline I was volunteering at. John began the call by stating he was considering going to a sporting goods store and buying a shotgun to end his life. In our hour-long call, I learned about his alcoholism, divorce, and job loss. I put myself in his shoes, tried to understand his pain, and validated his feelings. At the call's end, John said I talked him ""off the ledge."" This call was meaningful to me because I made a clear impact on John's life; hearing that John no longer felt suicidal made me feel like my life had a purpose. Conversations like these have reaffirmed my decision to enter medicine, for providing compassion is more rewarding to me than writing code.

Many professions require compassion — therapy, social work, clergy. However, only a doctor has the privilege of listening to people while also being able to perform interventions like closed reductions. Additionally, I want to become a doctor because their training makes them the best person to treat diseases like diabetes. In my time off from school, I recovered from my generalized anxiety disorder. I feel ready to care for patients and now understand what they go through.

As a physician, in addition to seeing patients, I want to build an innovative healthcare company. Although I have engineering and startup experience, having a doctor's training will allow me to better understand and solve problems in medicine. My background will also provide valuable insights when artificial intelligence is used in medicine. For example, when an AI program detects a breast lesion, I will be able to explain what this means to a concerned patient. 

Regardless of the advances in AI, no one wants to hear a diagnosis from a computer. Thus, there will always need to be someone there with the patient. I hope to be that person with the patient; I want to be the doctor patients like Nancy can call.","My brother and I have taken different paths in life.

Both my grandmother and mother had diabetes and I grew to fear what would become of my own health, thinking I was next in line as I watched them prick their fingers for blood every morning. Every time I visited my pediatrician, she validated my concerns: I was obese and pre-diabetic. I began to despise these visits because they always ended with the same seemingly impractical treatment plan – a healthier diet and exercise. 
Despite my pediatrician’s recommendations, it was challenging to prioritize health in our household. My parents spent most of their time working in order to make ends meet, often sacrificing health and nutrition for convenience and affordability. Given our limited resources, they focused on putting food on the table and a roof over our heads. As such, our health was only an afterthought and I continuously struggled to make healthier lifestyle changes. My doctor’s orders felt out of reach. 
As a first-generation college student at UC San Diego (UCSD), I gained a deeper understanding of the barriers to care and community health. I learned about the social determinants of health through my coursework and saw firsthand how factors such as environment and economic stability impacted members of a community. I was able to envision what it means to make health more accessible when I began volunteering at various community health clinics both locally and abroad. In 2019, I traveled with UCSD’s Global Medical Training to provide free health assessments and medical treatment to rural communities in the Dominican Republic. There, I learned that a dirty riverbank was the community’s main source of water for bathing, cooking, and cleaning. I began to see the correlation between their environment and the high prevalence of female patients who arrived with vaginal infections, among other medical concerns. I worked closely with a local physician from Haiti, and observed how he not only prescribed medication to treat the infection, but also carefully educated his patients about boiling water in order to prevent recurrence. I realized how imperative this was for a community who had limited access to care and became inspired by the level of resourcefulness and empathy it took to be a physician that provides care in under-resourced settings.
I had the opportunity to further understand the impact of social determinants of health during my time as an undergraduate research assistant at the iSTRIVE research lab and studied intersectional risk factors experienced by youth in the U.S.-Mexico border region. In focus groups, I listened to adolescents share how the cost and location of services prevented them from receiving proper sexual and reproductive healthcare. As I became aware of the detrimental health outcomes that disproportionately affected this population due to these barriers, I began to see the value of the research I did. The voices of the youth and other community members were vital to understanding the need for resources in their community. As a physician, I see an opportunity to empower similar voices by providing accessible care and resources to address the health inequities they face.
My experiences have opened my eyes to the inherent responsibility in the work of a physician to bridge the gap between social determinants and health itself. As I interacted with various communities, I realized that each patient has a story, making each gap unique. Some patients arrive with all of the details, and others require probing and inquiry – almost like a puzzle, where each detail acts as a piece that contributes to the overarching picture of health. I am intrigued by how a single question, whether it be regarding a patient’s living conditions or insurance coverage, acts as a piece needed to understand their ability to maintain their health outside the clinic. With every patient interaction, I became increasingly motivated to become a physician that dedicates my work toward solving the complexities in every puzzle of a patient’s story, and allowing them to inform how I will provide compassionate care. 
The health disparities I witnessed throughout the communities I have worked with, as well as my own, have also made me realize the importance of physicians who are committed to making health equitable for patients of all backgrounds. My desire to pursue a career in medicine has grown as I worked alongside various physicians, community leaders, and volunteers who share a common goal of promoting health equity among underserved communities. The need for curiosity, resourcefulness, and compassion with every patient interaction has all contributed to the type of physician I want to become. Moreover, I aspire to be the physician I needed when I was a young girl struggling to manage my own health amidst the greater socioeconomic issues at hand. Health should not be viewed as a commodity and as a physician, I want to make care and resources accessible in ways that eliminate this perception for patients in need.","As a hospital intern, I have been berated and swung at. One patient, in particular, used the strongest, most profane language as I assisted him. Perhaps he preferred to be cared for by an intern of a similar race or a nurse instead, I thought.

When my brother and I were both prematurely born, it seemed like the world had already given us a rough start. I was underweight and had mild episodes of GERD reflux. Bryan was born via emergency C-section and struggled with respiratory failure and eye defects. After receiving life-saving amounts of oxygen, his eyes deteriorated and he was robbed of his vision.

Bryan introduced me to the difficult yet intriguing aspects of medicine as soon as he came home.

Instead of independently walking with a walking stick, my parents wanted teachers and friends to guide him. Instead of learning and reading braille, they decided that talking and listening to radio podcasts was enough. As he matured, he was frustrated by the difficulties of the generalized treatment he received. So, I began advocating for him. Despite my parent’s resistance, I advocated for our school to emphasize teaching him braille and how to use a walking stick. I volunteered at my local talking book library and brought home audiobooks and braille books. After years of research, persuasion, and emotionally-charged family discussions, my parents were finally okay with my brother attending a residential school specifically for blind children. Now finishing up his first semester at the school, he is receiving accommodations tailored to his specific needs, becoming more independent, healthier, and even happier. Not only did Bryan give me early exposure to interesting pharmaceuticals and medical interventions, but he also provided me with an introduction to the cultural battles surrounding medicine.

The discourse revolving around unique individuals, their personal situations, and culture is not exclusive to my family. I spend my Tuesday nights as a volunteer clinic manager for a free primary care clinic. Our core mission is to provide inclusive care to uninsured individuals. Other days, I work as a medical scribe and assistant for an orthopedic surgery clinic. From a skier with an ACL injury that will hinder them from pursuing an olympian career, to an uninsured Venezuelan mother with severe postpartum depression planning to kill her newborn child, I have met and encountered many events of tragedy. Fortunately, medicine has  allowed these individuals to have a second chance. The patient with an ACL rupture had extensive reconstructive surgery and is recovering well. The Venezuelan mother was given life-altering, no-cost pharmaceuticals with therapy and is now happily raising her son. 

I am pursuing medicine because I am aware of the incredibly broad reach that medicine may have. The service work I have participated in, the clinical environments I have witnessed, and my personal familial experiences have all solidified my aspirations and shaped me into someone who truly desires to continue with this career path. Additionally, when I have the privilege of practicing medicine, I will make it my personal goal to continue on the legacy of free, low-cost clinics.

Western-influenced medicine and innovations tend to favor a general, one-size fits all template. The round peg forced to fit into the square hole eventually breaks, and so I believe we should instead, smooth out the rigid edges of the square hole to allow the round peg to seamlessly fit. Medicine should be adjusted in a way that advocates for the individual’s personal circumstances and is tailored for an individual’s specific needs, cultural traditions, and socioeconomic barriers. We should always be cognizant of these differences because our patients deserve our empathy and understanding as a means to a better life. As a physician, I will advocate for these individuals, as I did with my brother, and be the change I wish to see in modern-day life and medicine.","From tutoring at-risk youth to treating wealthy stockbrokers, I have met and empathized with many people. My most insightful experience was when I was a math tutor for a girl named Kelly. We met every Friday morning to discuss the principles of adding and subtracting numbers. It was through Kelly that I learned about her Latina family. While eating with her family at dinner, I learned that her parents were against the new Covid vaccine. As immigrants, they had a minor language barrier and only obtained their information from certain media outlets. These were flooded with a conglomerative of true and false information but have mostly dissuaded them from getting vaccinated. Even though I disagreed with them, I validated their feelings and respected their decision to abstain from the vaccine. Reflecting on this situation, I remembered that people have a right to their bodily autonomy, and we should always remain open-minded to learn from their perspectives and opinions. ","I currently volunteer as a clinic manager for a nonprofit, student-led free clinic that focuses on delivering healthcare to low-income populations. From untreated diabetes to manic psychiatric cases, I guided patients through the difficulties of societal and healthcare barriers. I remember a time when an HIV/AIDS positive man presented to the clinic. He described his year-long difficulties obtaining proper treatments with very little money and no medical insurance. Within 30 minutes of checking into the clinic, we provided him with a pharmaceutical course that saved his life. I have always felt the need to emphasize accessibility to healthcare, especially for underserved or low-income patients. My experiences at this free clinic were what shaped my desire for health equity and what jump-started my passion for free clinics. As a medical student in Chicago, I will continue the legacy of free clinics for the underserved population and am excited to learn more about RCSIP‚Äôs clinics. ",,,1,"I saw that the pandemic changed many people, some temporarily and others in the permanent loss of loved ones. During the pandemic, I became sick and had my MCAT rescheduled multiple times. However, in the peak of Covid, I stayed home as a student, but continued to see my mom and other frontline healthcare workers risk their lives. COVID-19 taught me that working in healthcare and any essential personnel job takes intense resiliency, strength, and bravery, which motivates me to continue my pursuit of medicine. I witnessed the various ways our government responded to a global pandemic, how science can literally save our lives by synthesizing a new vaccine, and lastly, I learned how to raise a pandemic puppy. At this point, I can confidently say that I am ready to begin my exciting journey into medicine.",1,0,1

I was born to immigrant parents who distrusted the medical system and relied on naturopathic remedies and alternative medicines to cure most ailments. However, these modalities did not stand a chance against my congenital heart defect. I remember sensing my parents’ apprehension and fear when my pediatrician and cardiologist pushed for me to undergo open heart surgery. Fortunately, the operation was a success. As I gradually healed, my shortness of breath dissipated, my energy levels rebounded, and the dark circles from beneath my eyes vanished. I was fascinated by the “magic” behind the medicine; the seed for my passion to pursue a career in this field was planted.

Over the years, my perception of medicine evolved and shifted with exposure to different experiences. I saw medicine as an ever-present force which brought comfort to many of my loved ones. It served as a glimmer of hope when my grandmother emigrated from Poland to receive chemotherapy for her aggressive breast cancer. It became a guardian when it rescued my father twice after he suffered a heart attack and underwent double bypass surgery. At the same time, I observed medicine’s limitations, especially when it proved futile in saving my dear friend and laboratory director from a fatal arrhythmia.

Through these experiences – both the good and the bad – it became clear to me that medicine’s grounding in science and technology is often key in saving lives. I wanted to master the creative, problem-solving mindset that is so essential in this field. When I joined the Paller lab at Northwestern, I was given the opportunity to address real world medical problems through innovative technologies. My research addressed an unmet clinical need for wound healing therapeutics among the diabetic patient population. Although frustrating at times, I found my research immensely rewarding. I knew my hours of creating 3D human skin cultures and prototyping stratified skin models with embedded nerves could potentially help someone, even if not until sometime in the future. Ultimately, I found that I value translational research and its potential for providing a better and healthier future, but I find assisting others in the present more fulfilling.

My volunteer work in college demonstrated the nature of medicine through a human lens. One night, I was on call when my coordinator notified me that one of our patients, as he was nearing his final hours, was in need of a compassionate companion. I quickly made my way to St. Mary’s Hospital where I found the terminally ill patient entirely alone. Beside him lay a book of blessings by John O’Donohue. I quietly read to him, hoping to offer some comfort. As I watched his chest rise and fall, I noticed his respirations gradually becoming shallower. I took his hand and held it with a strength and warmth that contrasted his frail condition. Although a stranger, I felt spiritually connected to him as I prayed the rosary at his bedside until he took his last breath. In that room, I participated in a holistic approach to healing that serves the body, mind and spirit with equal measure. Volunteering ultimately fueled my desire to provide care to patients in a more humanistic way. 

My clinical experience as a medical assistant has allowed me to see the effects of modern science while in a real primary care clinic – blending my respect for and knowledge of science with my love of interacting with patients. At the clinic, I noticed that many diabetic patients had not undergone screening for diabetic retinopathy, a disease that causes vision loss. Utilizing the knowledge gained while conducting diabetic neuropathy research, I piloted the use of a retinal imaging tool which has helped many patients with their eye health. 

Among these patients, one was particularly memorable. Sitting on the exam table before me, she had a dejected look and solemnly expressed her concerns. As I scanned her ophthalmology report, a key detail stood out: further loss of vision is very high. I acknowledged her struggles and despair, which helped ease her anxiety. After her doctor and I discovered that she was lacking an awareness and understanding of diabetes, reliable transportation, and financial stability, we worked to address these obstacles. We validated her concerns and offered an individualized care plan, resulting in immense relief and gratitude. This encounter was memorable because I saw firsthand how medicine’s commitment to the entirety of the human experience can ultimately save someone from life-threatening circumstances.

My volunteer, research and clinical experiences have validated my decision to pursue a career in medicine that is rooted both in science and compassionate care. I have no doubt that I am up to the challenge of medical training, so that I can someday become a physician committed to providing care that involves understanding the people behind the symptoms. I know I will have achieved my greatest professional goal if I become a physician that my eight-year-old self would have been proud to call “her doctor”.","As a free clinic volunteer and medical assistant, I care for a diverse patient population daily. Among all the patient encounters I have had, a memory of caring for an elderly Hispanic woman with limited English proficiency and lack of adherence to her medications stands out to me. While actively listening to her concerns, I realized that ethnocultural differences and lack of understanding contributed to her fear and apprehension. Without being able to easily communicate, I sought out creative ways to offer tactful, compassionate care through using teach-back methods and being mindful of my body language and tone of voice. I learned the importance of identifying patients‚Äô unique health challenges and ensuring that each patient has a basic understanding of their health and options. My experiences have allowed me to better care for all patients, as I now appreciate how their beliefs and value systems impact their ability to participate in their medical care.","As a medical assistant, I have seen first hand how the pandemic has affected routine healthcare provision, especially for our diabetic patients. Moreover, I noticed that diabetes-related care measures were not being met, especially diabetic foot and eye exams. While diabetic foot exams can be performed in the clinic, many patients did not follow up with their ophthalmologists to undergo retinal imaging screening. Utilizing the diabetes knowledge base I acquired during my research fellowship at Northwestern, I worked with my clinical director to roll out a diabetic vision screening initiative using Retinavue. This handheld retinal camera enables remote ophthalmologists to diagnose diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetes during their routine primary care office visits. During the pandemic, I was able to address an unmet clinical need through implementing this tool, delivering real-time insights at the point of care and making diabetic eye care more accessible to our patients.",,,1,"In March of 2020, I continued my courses virtually, conducted discussions virtually while assistant teaching, and stopped my extracurricular obligations. I encountered challenges with my MCAT exam because it was rescheduled multiple times until late summer. The pandemic also has impacted my perspective on public health as it has shed light and exacerbated pre-existing health disparities. This knowledge furthered my desire to close the gap by taking on a clinical facing role as a medical assistant. In this role, I help ensure that our patients have a basic understanding of their health and help facilitate access to resources based on patient needs. I have also supported medical providers through multiple COVID-19 outbreaks while helping keep our staff healthy and safe. During the pandemic, I learned the balancing act of leading patient testing and treatment while addressing the needs of the regular stream of non-COVID patients.",0,0,3
2023,15025077,,26,Man,MEX,0,,1,1,"Living in a rural, small town in East Tennessee, we were medically underserved and underrepresented both by geography and ethnicity. My family also endured socio-economic hardships coming from a low-income, Mexican immigrant family of seven. They were limited in the work they could do and had little to no government assistance due to our immigration status. In all, the thought of obtaining a college education and becoming a physician seemed unattainable, conflated with the fact that I did not have deportation protection until DACA issued in 2012.

Not wanting to be defined by circumstances, I focused on academics as a way out. I became a 1st-generation high school graduate and went to college as a 1st-generation student on scholarship. As a 1st-generation student, I was not prepared for all the challenges of college which caused a drop in my grades, a C/D+ in both organic chemistries. Learning from my mistakes, I changed my studying tactics leading me to have a solid upward trend in my junior and especially in senior year when I got A’s in both retakes and graduated “cum laude” with a biochemistry degree.

I had appendicitis and needed emergency surgery. I was terrified going from extreme pain to suddenly being told I needed to have surgery; it made 12-year-old me feel very overwhelmed. I am from a Mexican immigrant family whose parents primarily speak Spanish with some working English. Thankfully, “Dr. Stiles” went above and beyond to alleviate our worries. He took his time to interpret for my parents, explain things calmly to me, and reassured us throughout my stay. Seeing how well he treated me and my parents during a very vulnerable time, I decided I wanted to go into medicine. I want to be just like the doctor that treated a scared child and his terrified Spanish-speaking parents so well. I want to be that source of comfort and care for my community especially in rural, low-income, and Spanish-speaking areas where there are not a lot of people of color, people like my family and I, as physicians.

I was just a 19-year-old when my family had to go through our most harrowing night. My twin, Rene, and I were sleeping in our room like normal when I was awakened to the sound of strained gasping. What I saw will forever stay with me. Rene was violently convulsing, struggling to breathe, and had a glazed appearance. He was having a seizure. I yelled for my parents, waking my siblings in the process. Not knowing what to do, my parents went to his side and tried to comfort him as best they could. My sister was crying hysterically, and my little brother was frozen with fear. With everyone letting their emotions get the best of them, I knew I had to be one to get us through this together. I told them to hold Rene on his side to allow him to breathe better, keep soothing him, and for my sister to call EMS. EMS came a few moments later, and I gave my report to them as they assessed and took Rene away. Once at the hospital, we saw that Rene was feeling better albeit with some sluggishness. Throughout this night, I felt so ill-prepared to help. Knowing how it feels to be a patient and family member in a medical crisis, I want to go into medicine so that I am prepared to help other patients and their families.

My clinical experiences have cemented my drive to be a doctor. As an undergraduate neuroscience intern, I give cognitive exams. I remember being told about a patient, “Jane”, who has severe anxiety and was feeling very uncomfortable being at the clinic. Knowing this, I tried my best to make her feel comfortable throughout the exam, so I listened, encouraged, and gave her ample time to answer. Jane scored fantastically in the end and was rightfully proud of her accomplishment. She just needed a little encouragement. As a nurse technician on an oncology floor, I got to know my patients from working multiple night shifts. I had a very kind, elderly patient, “Tom”, who was on the floor due to bouts of neutropenia. He and his wife, “Maggie”, rarely asked for anything as he was mostly independent during his stay. However, one night I was called to his room. Opening his door, I saw that he was profusely sweating and trembling uncontrollably. Maggie said that he was having one of his “bad nights” where he would overheat giving him the “shakes.” In a hushed, shaky voice, he said that a cup of ice water and something cold to hold to his head was all he needed. I said that I’d be right back with the items. After closing their door, I hurried to get ice water and an ice pack returning a few moments later. Checking in later that night, Tom was cooled and doing much better, and Maggie was at ease. Seeing them in a better state, I was relieved I was able to make their night better. Both experiences showed me that medicine is a service industry where you treat people and not only illnesses. I want to pursue medicine to provide patients with the best service possible to leave them doing better than when they came to me.

Volunteering at a free clinic has allowed me to be the change and representation that I want for my community. Because of my Mexican heritage, I can linguistically and culturally relate to Spanish-speaking patients. I remember translating for a distraught mother, “Maria”. Her toddler, “Manny”, had a painfully infected ear. I was able to confer Manny’s symptoms to the physician and pharmacist so that they could get her the needed antibiotics. I also talked about superheroes with Manny as we waited for the medicine to keep his mind off things. At the end of the visit, Maria was relieved to have the medication needed to treat Manny's ear, and Manny was ready to watch a superhero movie. I was ecstatic I could be of service to them. As an immigrant, I want to give back to my community, and these interactions have shown me that I can do just that. In all, I plan to use my translating skills and my cultural background as an immigrant to reach a wider community in medicine.

Undoubtedly, all my experiences have prepared and led me to medicine. I hope to be able to implement changes in medicine for the better of everyone involved, and I plan to serve my community by using my cultural competencies, interpersonal skills, and clinical experiences to provide quality care to the most vulnerable and underserved populations in medicine.","While not an official member, I sometimes partook in activities for my college‚Äôs PRIDE club. The club promotes equality and tolerance about LGBTQ+, women‚Äôs, and social issues. While I am a straight cis man, I want nothing but the best for all members of the LGTBQ+ community. I also know the hardships that the LGTBQ+ and women face for recognition. As a pre-med, I met many amazing female peers during my college years. Their stories of people telling them not to pursue science or medicine was disheartening. It was not because they were not equipped for the job. It was because they were women going into a male-dominated field. I could only relate to a Mexican immigrant's point of knowing how it feels to be seen as different and not entirely accepted into a larger community. My experience with these great individuals shows that I still need to learn more to be a better advocate and ally for change.","At the free clinic where I volunteer, I was able to help a patient get the care he truly needed. He organically only came to get pain medication for his back. While translating for him, he also told me that he was having problems with depression due to the loss of his father and the possibility that he had herpes from a past sexual encounter. Because he felt comfortable with me as a fellow BIPOC/Latino, we could also give him medication for depression and his STD and point him toward the health department, which could further help him._x000D_

Also, I was recently able to get one of our economically disadvantaged nurse practitioners in contact with a patient assistance program to give her free medication for her type 2 diabetes.

Seeing that the pandemic was still limiting my ability to gain shadowing and clinical experiences, I decided to wait to apply in the 2022 cycle and not in the 2021 cycle. I then spent the year gaining fantastic clinical and shadowing experiences and being mentored by excellent physicians along the way. The pandemic challenged me as an individual, and I knew I had to rise to the challenge to mature and learn from it.

Sixteen-year-old me was a self-proclaimed rockstar, dragging out one-hundred pounds of music gear into dark clubs to play for eight people. I was fueled by the feeling of being on stage – the adrenaline, the lights, and the noise. I considered music my dream, not medicine, much less the academic rigors involved with becoming a doctor. 

However, before I graduated high school, with my parents' voices reverberating in my ears, I realized that I would need a more realistic career to pursue while I waited for music to propel me to stardom. As hesitant as I was to fathom the possibility that I would never become the rockstar of my dreams, I obliged. This more realistic career option was working as a firefighter. The pace of firefighters responding to emergencies seemed to match the pace I enjoyed so much on stage. The job could be loud, energetic, bright, and exciting, much like the feeling of strumming away and singing until my voice was fried in a dingy club. Surprisingly, it was just what I needed to kickstart my interest in becoming a physician.

As a child, I was curious about the medical profession. The sights and sounds of an ambulance passing would stop me in my tracks. I could not keep myself from watching it fly by, with busy paramedics in the back working to save someone’s life. With this child still somewhere in my psyche, I enrolled in an EMT class after graduating high school. As my EMT course began, I realized that I could not only enjoy learning but excel at it. My EMT license led to my job with the fire department, which led to my paramedic license. Before I knew it, I was a full-fledged firefighter/paramedic, entering a career I could have continued to work in until retirement, but I craved a deeper learning. I spent a semester pursuing pre-med prerequisites full time, but with my job at the fire department, I found little success. My clinical rotations in the hospital were fascinating, yet I felt I was missing a level of depth. With each patient I transported to the hospital, I wondered more about their journey after we dropped them off. I eventually began instructing EMS courses as adjunct faculty, where I started to realize that my love for learning about medicine meshed with my love for teaching it. I wanted to continue this learning in medical school, so I left the fire service to focus on my newfound dream full time. 

My interest in academics developed organically, through an urge to learn more. Although I had once not been interested in school, once I solely focused on my education, my pre-med classes began to leave me entrenched in curiosity and wonder; I have not yet escaped this feeling. A lecture on sickle cell anemia in my genetics course left me more capable of understanding what patients with the condition go through, and how they ended up with it, for instance. I am constantly attempting to connect topics taught in my lectures with experiences that I have had in the hospital. As I continue taking classes in the sciences, I am drawn closer to medicine as I realize that continuous learning is a passion for me, and a necessity in the profession. Physicians must stay current on the newest, evidence-based practices, to provide the best care for their patients. Knowing this, I look forward to learning new things every single day as a medical student, and someday as a physician. 

At this point, I feel at-home in my academic journey. Prior to solely pursuing education, I was unaware of how much working as a team with classmates mirrored my experience of working together with the members of various bands. Just as a mutual working relationship with my bandmates would increase the quality of music, so does the team atmosphere in the classroom. Much of my enjoyment in college has revolved around working with classmates who have similar goals to mine, in order to learn the most we can.

I also experience this team dynamic in my current work in the emergency department. As an ED tech, I have learned how all members of a healthcare team work together. We all perform vital tasks to provide the best patient care. Physicians would not be able to deliver proper care without the collaboration of nurses and various support staff, such as myself. The healthcare workers I admire understand this concept through and through. They realize that we are all in this together, and job title is not as important as being a vital member of the ED team. I have thrived as a team member, and plan to incorporate this valuable practice into my career in medicine.

Starting with my journey in EMS and continuing into the hospital setting, I have direction and valuable learned lessons that ignite my interest in a career as a physician. I am capable and motivated to succeed in medicine at the highest level. Over the last ten years I have grown from someone with little interest in academics – someone whose rockstar backup plan was to work as a firefighter – to someone with an entirely different set of priorities. Playing music is still very important to me, but it is no longer my dream – practicing as a physician is my dream – and one which I am ready to pursue to my fullest potential.","As someone who grew up in and around the city of Chicago, I have spent my whole life observing this city's immense diversity. Although I have not worked in healthcare in the city, I have witnessed the healthcare inequities of individuals without medical access in my suburban emergency department. Over the past two years I have watched many patients struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system, often presenting to the emergency department with seemingly benign concerns because they feel they have nowhere else to turn. These patients are often under or uninsured, with little access to quality healthcare. The best physicians with whom I have worked have shown me that with effective patient education and providing necessary resources, we can do a substantial amount of good for these patients. I have observed the ways the best practitioners provide for those who are under or uninsured, and I plan to emulate these practices in my role as a physician in the future. ","My involvement in the Future Health Professionals Club at Northeastern Illinois University has allowed me to give back to the Chicago community surrounding the NEIU campus. In the fall of 2021, our group assembled care packages for Chicago's homeless population. Subsequently, we dispersed these care packages, including some in the vicinity of Rush University on Chicago's west side. We have continually endeavored to support those in need by organizing and conducting blood drives, educating kids on oral health, and volunteering at local food banks to pack food. My experience as vice president of this organization has equipped me with the required leadership skills necessary to continue serving Chicago community members while in medical school. With this, I am excited and prepared to collaborate with other students at Rush Medical College to provide community service to Chicago residents through the Rush Community Service Initiatives Program.",,,1,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, I began working in the emergency department.

Early in my journey, I met Daniel* while volunteering for a health fair in Los Angeles under the UMMA Clinic, a free clinic for the underserved. Daniel was an on-shift security guard whose first stop was the free food table. After he joked that his two bagels would taste better with a Coca-Cola, I encouraged him to receive a health evaluation at a nearby station. Daniel said “Nothing’s broken if you don’t know about it.” Our laughs were immediately followed by a shared look, we both recognized the danger in a statement like that. After a brief conversation about soccer, with a segue into healthy lifestyles and preventative care, he was willing to have his finger pricked. Ten minutes later he informed me his readings looked good, thankfully. It was a happy ending to a pleasant afternoon chat.

Not all my experiences with medicine have left me feeling as accomplished. Two weeks after being hired at my lab, I was tasked with euthanizing 28 mice in a single evening. It was one thing to stain glass slides of mouse brains, another to watch the light leave their eyes as I injected the pentobarbital. The irony was deafening, on a mission to save lives, here I was sacrificing dozens. Despite following humane euthanasia protocol, I came home that night feeling void.
What brought me back into the lab on Monday was an email my principal investigator, Dr. Cole, shared with me years ago as an undergraduate volunteer. The husband and caretaker of a clinical trial subject reached out to Dr. Cole and explained how our lab’s Alzheimer’s treatment has dramatically improved their quality of life. He explained how every morning and evening when dressing his wife, she would vehemently resist for up to thirty minutes. After our treatment, she’s still sick with poor memory, but now she allows the wardrobe change. The additional hour per day he spends with her means the world to him. Hallmarks of progress like those are what reaffirm my passion towards medicine. Knowing that it's possible to make a real change.

Each project I’ve had the privilege to participate in has its own stories with unique characters, differing objectives, and special memories. Nowhere else do you find stories like you do in medicine. They’re often sad. My story isn’t as grim: a single-parent household, struggling with poverty being a first-generation college graduate. I thank God that my uninsured family had health conditions limited only to my flat feet, which still managed to get me through three marathons. Life has been difficult, but surmountable.

What seems insurmountable is the news program that led to my first tear, a video of a charred Syrian child hobbling across a street of rubble. Or more recently, a Ukrainian family who just lost their home. I hear the stories from my parents who came to America as refugees, and I know by one stroke of luck, I’m here, safe in my Los Angeles home, and despite sharing a room with my three siblings we don’t have bombs flying over our heads.

Then I turn my gaze away from the TV and down our apartment corridor and see our family friends, the Rabadis, and their severely intellectually disabled son, their middle child, David* sprinting through the hall equipped with his vibrant red helmet. Knowing that no matter how pure and lovable David is, his fate is all but written.
That’s why I aspire towards a career in medicine. That’s why I’ve put hours into volunteering at clinics, attending health fairs, doing research, and studying. It’s why reading Dr. Paul Kalanithi's When Breathe Becomes Air and thinking “he did everything right and still died before getting his dream job” only reaffirmed my passion for medicine. Because it’s not fair that the best we can do is give that husband and caretaker one extra hour with his wife; or that those Syrian children have to experience half a dozen surgeries; or that the Rabadis will never have “normal” lives. Because the world is not fair and we need more stories with happy endings like Daniel's.

The people behind each of these stories are what inspire me to become a physician. There’s a name, a spouse, a parent, a child, a life behind each one. I don’t want them to be characters in a narrative or statistics on a factsheet, they’re more than that. I want to remedy the fact that some people don’t get the chance at a life they deserve. I’m uncertain whether I’ll save orphans in Syria or expand upon the frontier of medicine and cure Alzheimer’s, but I’m optimistic. I’m optimistic that we can save someone from becoming another sad story.","At six years old, my family briefly relocated from Los Angeles to the Indonesian island of Banda Aceh. We were neighbors with the local people, we shared meals, we visited their homes, we were friends. To many people, my family and I were the first fair-skinned foreigners they had met.

The most special element to contributing to the UMMA Clinic was speaking with patients and getting to know the people we helped treat. Volunteering as Clinical Site Director at the UMMA Clinic felt meaningful because I knew that a few years ago, the family in the waiting room could have been my own. I saw firsthand how the statistics manifest into their daily life.

2023,15034676,,25,Man,USA,1,EO2,0,1,"I grew up in a single parent household as the oldest of two kids. We lived in public housing projects in New York City. My mom worked hard to support us, but there wasn't a lot of money to go around.  Furthermore, the closest hospitals to me were all a notable bus ride or 30 minute walk away. There wasn't much, if any, in the way of mental health resources nearby. At UChicago, I ended up receiving large amounts of financial aid on the school and federal level. This included Pell Grants. During college, I qualified for food stamps in the State of Illinois.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,14308,2710.0,,,4073.0,,0,0,1,4073,05/15/2021,University of Chicago,Biology,0,,Yes,No,Yes,"$25,000 - 49,999",3,1,1,0,75.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15,Lacking/Does Not Meet,1,2023,2,5.0,0.5,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,"Few people would say that visiting their grandmother in the hospital after surgery was a crucial or positive moment in their early childhood.  Apparently, that was in the cards for me as I entered the doors of Montefiore Hospital in September 2003. When I got to the room for my grandma Anna as she recovered from a double knee replacement, my four-year-old mind was amazed. She stood before me in the middle of a large mess of medical gadgets. My eyes raced, from monitors and machines to the clear fluid travelling into Anna via an amazing contraption that I later learned was an IV. After poring over all the equipment, I found “them”. The two even columns of surgical stitches new to Anna’s knees were hard to ignore. Their sudden, strange, and surviving appearance to this day has lasted with me. My memory of Anna’s mobility before the surgery is minor, but she kept up with me as I’ve grown up. 
While it took me another 15 years to begin getting clinical experience, my grasp of critical physician skills was shaped by two principles. I grew to value both giving back and doing more to restore health to the community. The latter shows in how my grandmother was helped by her surgeons. Since I had orthopedic surgeries of my own as a teen, I feel an added drive to contribute more. Being a doctor like those who improved both my life and Anna’s is how the former principle can be achieved. The job’s not easy, and I needed further understanding and time to know that it’s what I wanted to do with my life.  Over the past three or four years, the knowledge that “MD is for me”, was gained firsthand.  
I was fortunate enough to do cancer research during college, through the Center for Global Health (CGH). I was very excited to travel to Nigeria for the first time. However, I found myself in tough situations as I got used to the chaos of the ER. My research required the doctors I visited throughout the country to do a survey that took 30 minutes. This was a hard sell, with far more people to see than providers available. Surveys required multiple visits to complete, a problem only enhanced when shadowing. Critical cases came often to the ER, cutting time short as the doctor rushed to save lives. A lingering memory is the doctors showing me, with pride, the patients they were beginning to work on. They noted my reaction to metastasized cancers and partial amputations like a test I needed to pass. Shadowing and acing said tests was a huge driving factor behind my persistence in getting the surveys done, even in 100-degree weather. The bigger factor, though, was seeing my privilege and the opportunity afforded to me. While these people looked like me, Nigeria’s healthcare system paled in comparison to what I’d seen in America. Seeing these healthcare disparities up close provided new motivation for me to come home, achieve my dream, and give back. Doing so would help me be a global citizen, the goal of CGH. I don’t know if I’ll ever be back in Nigeria but doing good somewhere on Earth is enough for me. 
After graduating college, I began working as a medical assistant at Case Integrative Health. This gave me great experience working with patients, removing their IV lines, giving injections, and performing microcurrent neurofeedback. The last two years saw many visits where my heart wept for the chronic disease struggle our patients faced daily. Watching Dr. Kelley and her care and insight, I learned the ways that Lyme disease can wreak havoc on the body. With this knowledge handy, I was sad to hear so many people tell me that other doctors merely waved them away. Some even questioned the existence of Lyme altogether. These conversations have inspired me to do more to improve and restore the care of my patients, current and future. This principle is even more crucial for those coming in with more disputed ailments. Seeing a Morgellons’ patient bring in the fibers that she said crawled out her skin shocked me. Yet, hearing that she had been subject to mental health tests and police searches for seeking treatment almost brought me to tears. This stigma is the exact opposite of the care I wish to provide. I joined Dr. Kelley in assuring the woman that her experiences were valid.  This visit, among others, proved I must prioritize the patient’s voice and concerns and see them as person first, patient second. Bringing that approach with me moving forward should prove useful in restoring the health of those I see. 
Across the globe, my experience with research, patients, and physicians have bolstered my desire to join the medical field. These opportunities, occurring during and after attending UChicago, have helped me show critical physician skills and set goals for myself. One goal of mine is to wholeheartedly give back to communities that I serve. Seeing people not taken seriously and not getting the best care possible has instilled a strong sense of compassion in me. I strive to be a patient’s biggest advocate and supporter. My ultimate goal is to rejuvenate my patients and restore their lives. This happens both through physical healing of their body and emotional and mental support. With new experiences due with each person I treat, I know that being a doctor will keep me motivated and provide a constant sense of fulfillment.","My outlook on the world was permanently altered after my research trip to Nigeria in 2019. Being able to observe doctors trying to provide the best care possible despite the numerous factors working against them was quite inspirational. The hospitals I was able to shadow at were frequently overwhelmed by the number of patients to serve, and finances were an issue from the facilities lacking equipment and beds to the patients being unable to afford treatments or medications. Something that I continue to take from this experience looking back is how happy the average Nigerian I met was. They weren't lamenting what they lacked in resources, but were more grateful for what they did have as a result. This outlook is one I strive for daily. I learned that I am a global citizen from this experience, and so I've made it a goal to be able to help people both within and outside the communities I'm in. One person can make a bigger difference than they think, so that's my plan for my career ahead.","I'm very grateful to my current job for exploring the field of microcurrent neurofeedback and allowing me to administer this therapy to our patients. With over 500 sessions under my belt, I've been able to observe people's progress as I alter the protocol to their needs. Typically, the procedure will help with concentration, fatigue, and headaches. One patient that's seen a notable impact from the procedure had her first appointment following a concussion suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The accident left her unable to concentrate on tasks for an extended period of time and exacerbated her pre-existing headache condition. After 20+ sessions with her, she reports being able to concentrate for longer the day following the procedure, and less headaches as well. The patient comes in with her son, as both are patients at our clinic, and she thanks me frequently for the assist I provide in her being able to take care of him. I hope to have a similar impact on more patients in my career.",,,1,,1,1,0

Throughout my childhood, I frequently tagged along during clinical hours and was enamored by the aura of an operating room. As I got older, I admired how he treated his patients and could connect with each one of them. One of our favorite nightly routines was to go to the gym together. During these personal hours he still found time to answer a call from a patient or help someone with a medical question. As I reflected on these experiences, I realized I wanted to purse medicine not only because I wanted to be like my father but also because I fell in love with the idea of interacting with patients and positively impacting their lives. 
 
After years of shadowing my father’s work and seeing the various patient populations in his practice, I recognized how lucky I was to have access to excellent healthcare. However, I also learned about the significant healthcare disparities that exist in our country and around the world. I sought out first-hand experience to gain a deeper understanding of these issues. 

At the age of sixteen, I began volunteering for Medical Students in Action, an organization that provides primary and subspecialty care through medical mission trips to the Dominican Republic. During these trips, I saw physicians and medical students work together in tough scenarios with limited tools to reach a common goal. Witnessing such teamwork taught me that collaboration on all levels is essential for exceptional patient care. Most importantly, I saw each physician treat their patients like family, regardless of language or cultural barriers. Growing up as a person who prioritizes family, these were defining moments. I want to be the doctor for families that I expect other doctors to be for mine. These profound experiences solidified that I want to dedicate the rest of my life to serving others.

During my first semester in college, I got a call that my father was diagnosed with glioblastoma brain cancer. After witnessing countless patient encounters with my father throughout my life, we suddenly were on the other side of the looking glass. A million questions raced through my mind: “What are his surgical options? Is chemotherapy or radiation useful? What can we do to maximize his chances of beating this?” For a disease where outcomes are characterized in months rather than years, I suddenly understood how valuable every minute was. 

One year later, my father passed away. Although fighting glioblastoma was the hardest thing my father and family would experience, there was a lot to reflect on and learn from. Even in the darkest times, he showed resilience and an unwavering pursuit to be better, despite the circumstance. Every time I step in the library, volunteer, or attend class, I remind myself that I’m progressing one step closer to helping someone like my father and potentially changing the forecast for a family like mine. 

Throughout my father’s journey, I joined my mother in many of his appointments – from transfusion sessions to interpreting MRIs. I was a thoughtful listener and thorough in my research to help my family where I could as the cancer changed rapidly. I quickly realized that there were still many unanswered questions regarding the treatment of glioblastoma. My curiosity and the absence of an absolute solution drove me to dive deeper into glioblastoma research and ongoing clinical trials. I arrived at the understanding that improving patient outcomes and solving unfinished puzzles of complex diseases starts with quality research.

My interest in research led me to join Dr. Elizabeth Hammock and Dr. Michael Orsmbee in their respective labs, where I learned how to conduct research from the bottom up. Their labs focused on the influence of oxytocin production on mammalian development and the impact of different exercise and nutrition modalities on an individual’s health. I gained valuable lab skills while sectioning mice brains for protein staining and genotyping, and I developed a deeper understanding of the metabolic effects of exercise while data on patients undergoing VO2 max tests. I concluded that research is the epitome of being curious, pursuing a goal, and solving a problem – an exciting process resulting in advancements towards solutions for complex puzzles. 

As I go forward, I will continue to take initiative in my community to improve the lives of others through volunteer outreach, academic studies, and research endeavors. I will never forget the feeling of sitting in a quiet hospital room with my father, waiting for the doctor to come in and steer us in the next direction along the course of the disease. Despite the rigorous path ahead, I am confident that my work ethic and passion will allow me to overcome any challenge. These experiences form the foundation upon which I will work towards my ultimate goal of becoming a physician scientist, leading the forefront of academic medicine. It is now more than ever that I want to be part of the solution.","Going on medical mission trips to the Dominican Republic gave me a greater understanding of the cultural differences that exist and how they contribute to the grossly apparent healthcare disparities in some rural communities. I learned how prior knowledge of norms and practices in the community you are serving helps create a more effective treatment plan to combat ailments and injury. Understanding the religious beliefs of locals made communication from the physicians about the importance of taking certain medications of utmost importance. By being cognizant of local practices, physicians gained the trust and comfort of their Dominican patients. I believe that one of the most important aspects of medicine is being culturally knowledgeable and understanding of a patient's background and ideology. I plan on using the knowledge I have accrued from these medical mission trips in my future patient interactions and the communities I serve.","Through conversations with classmates my freshman year of high school, I immediately took notice of their difficulty fitting in or feeling like they belonged in one of the largest schools in the nation. A close friend of mine completed suicide not too far into my first semester, driving me to found the HOPE Sunshine Club. Its membership was inclusive of anyone's ideology and cultural/gender identity, resulting in working directly alongside the LGBTQ+ community. My goal was to create a safe space for all students who wanted to be heard. Student membership quickly grew to over 75 students within its first year. Thereafter, the FISP organization and I implemented HOPE into over 48 other schools throughout the course of three years. I soon received handwritten letters from parents mentioning the impact that the club had on their child's outlook and overall well-being. Students openly told me that the HOPE Sunshine Club saved their life. This is one of my proudest achievements. ",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic shook America amid my second semester in college. Despite the indefinite limitations on my academic and professional goals, I read research studies published by faculty at FSU and emailed those who I took a particular interest in, relaying my willingness to assist in their lab when an opportunity presented itself. Understandably, no lab on campus was able to accept students due to the COVID-19 violations during the pandemic. For this reason, my ability to get involved in laboratory research was delayed until later in college.",0,0,2

I nervously wondered if this procedure would be quick and smooth. Walking in with a welcoming appearance and calm demeanor, my nurse anesthesiologist got started on my blood draw and IV insertion. I was very anxious. However, she made me feel less embarrassed and safe at that moment. Upon waking up, my surgeon was reassuring and put my mind at ease. The care of this medical team was beyond what I could have expected that day. They ensured I was okay and listened to my concerns. A traumatic surgical experience morphed into an event that deepened my dedication to pursuing a career in medicine. It reminded me why I started: to use my unique experiences to be a relatable, encouraging physician. What I felt during that visit is the empathy and compassion I hope to share with those I touch in my medical career. That moment along with others has molded and deepened my desire to become a physician. 
Medicine is where I want to contribute my experiences to provide care to an integral part of human existence. I want to give the most compassionate care possible to my future patients by being an active listener and always having my patient’s best interests at the forefront of my mind. My training as a certified nursing assistant has deepened my understanding of the importance of treating patients with dignity and respect. I also have become better at learning about patients quickly to better serve their needs. I desire to be a physician that promotes comfort and open communication. Ensuring that I am entering every situation with an open mind has helped me develop the skills needed to achieve this goal. The times that I have interacted with patients let me have a personal part in their care. I remember a patient recovering from a gunshot wound at a hospital where I volunteered. She called the nurses’ desk multiple times to connect with a counseling service offered through the hospital. I could tell she was in a lot of pain and confusion, while she asked for information about the counseling services. On this day, the call phone had a poor connection, so I walked to her room. She was very sweet and soft-spoken yet looked so lonely in that frigid room. Although I could not give her an immediate answer, I knew that she needed her urgent pleas to fall on attentive ears. Interacting with her and reassuring her that the help she needed would soon arrive in the form of a call from her nurse added fuel to my desire of becoming a physician. 
Developing and maintaining relationships with my patients is essential to being the physician I envision. Providing care to an elderly patient at a rehabilitation center imparted wisdom regarding how hard it can be for patients to deal with ailments preventing them from caring for themselves in all capacities. I was a companion, but I also helped with her activities of daily living. I relished this position because I developed a meaningful relationship with her and other residents and learned about their personal experiences. I often shared food and stories with my client and her next-door neighbor, learning how to fulfill my caretaker duties while still being personable. Their experiences were invaluable because they allowed me to deepen our relationship and improve me as a healthcare provider. The residents shared personal details with me that showed how important it is to be there to listen to patients and learn from them. It was more than a job to me; I was helping my client in a journey to regain mobility and independence, a priceless role to hold in someone’s life. I remember assisting her with leg workouts. Seeing her determination to get better made me truly appreciate her spirit of positivity amid her daily struggles. There were tough days. She often became discouraged, but I was there to encourage her. I reminded her of the progress she had and of her family. The physical and occupational therapy, like making bread pudding, also uplifted her. That does not come close to all the prizes we would win at weekly bingo, though. The residents at this facility showed me what enjoying life was about and the importance of being open-minded. 
As I continue my journey in medicine, I want to carry my experiences into my career. I will continue to be inspired and motivated by the interactions I have with patients. The many lessons learned from the health professionals and patients who have crossed paths with me remind me that learning is universal. I have been given opportunities to share my compassion, watch patients grow, and, most importantly, listen to them. I look forward to more opportunities to play a role in someone’s journey in health.","Working as a registered line technician put me in contact with patients and families from various backgrounds. Although my primary goal was to ensure I was provided quality applied behavioral analysis therapy, I needed to understand my clients and aid them in getting the most out of our interactions. I remember a new client we had.  He was very young and neither he nor his family spoke much English. He came every day visibly upset. However, we learned he found comfort in watching shows like Splash and Bubbles. I also made sure to speak to him in simple phrases. My coworkers and I did our best to be welcoming and reassuring. Working with him made me take the time to put myself in his shoes. I was reminded that comfort is very important and that adjusting to uncomfortable situations can be challenging. I learned to lead with empathy and not make assumptions about what I thought he and his family were going through. I became more open-minded and understanding through this experience.","During my college career, I volunteered for two semesters at the school's Vincent‚Äôs Vault Food Pantry. I served students and faculty who were economically disadvantaged. We provided them with fresh fruits and vegetables, nonperishable items, and hygiene products. I also sought the services of the pantry. I understood what it felt like to feel vulnerable and to have to lean on another person for help with necessities. I have always wanted to give back to underserved and underrepresented communities which inspired me to pursue this profession. Because of this experience, I will bring a caring, nonjudgmental attitude into every patient encounter and strive to improve the care being administered in whatever way I can as a student. I want to attend an institution that empowers its students to enact change in the communities they reside in.  ",,,1,"When the pandemic first hit, I was completing my sophomore year of college.

I repeated these words to myself as I delivered breaths to a barely breathing, unconscious woman. My first emergency call as an EMT was stressful, demanding, and transformative; this call, and all of the following calls, have cemented my passion for a career as a medical doctor.

My EMT crew had received a dispatch for a “person in respiratory distress.” As I rushed to the ambulance, the possible causes raced through my mind: Asthma? COPD? Anaphylaxis? When we arrived on scene, I was shocked. She was a young mother. I checked her pulse and felt nothing. 

This was my first encounter with a patient in critical condition. The Charge EMT, Ali, was training me that day. She quickly instructed a firefighter to initiate compressions while I prepared to administer oxygen to the patient. I looked down on the young woman lying before me. Her face was a pale blue. It seemed like nothing in my EMT course prepared me for a moment like this. I calmed myself and focused on the essentials: airway, breathing, and circulation. Ali applied the defibrillator pads to the young woman’s chest and – after one shock – her pulse came back. As I continued to deliver breaths, Ali made sure I held a proper seal and told me to count out loud.

I was inspired by Ali’s remarkable ability to multitask. She was able to provide lifesaving care while teaching a novice EMT. She changed my life that day. From that point on, I would dedicate myself to being prepared for any situation that came my way. I spent the next two years undergoing extensive training, attending EMS conferences, and working countless shifts. Each call was unique, requiring me – under pressure – to think critically about what treatments would be most effective in the moment. As I became a more skilled EMT, my passion for medicine grew. 

Initially, my interest in medicine was motivated by a fascination with understanding disease and how to effectively treat it. I was intrigued by the complexity of biological processes and how a seemingly small change in an amino acid or a malfunctioning enzyme could have major ramifications on someone’s health. This academic, clinical interest expanded over time into a real-world desire to alleviate suffering by providing personalized, effective care to patients in their most desperate moments.

And the calls kept coming. One day, my crew received a dispatch for a 50-year-old intoxicated female. We rushed to the woman’s home. Clearly inebriated and with tears in her eyes, the frazzled woman was initially unable to understand my questions. I instinctively reached out my hand to comfort her. The woman firmly grasped my hand, shook her head, and took a deep breath. Still holding my hand, she told me about her son who had recently passed away. She blamed herself for not noticing that her baby boy was sick and lamented her subsequent alcohol abuse. She was struggling to get through the hardest loss in her life.

Any emergency department would have the IV fluids this woman needed. But not every hospital would have the psychiatric services this woman required. By taking the time to understand my patient, I realized that she should be transported to a hospital that provided specialized psychiatric care. Her immediate physical problem was solvable. I recognized that the underlying issue called for a longer-term solution. Patients like this woman have encouraged me to spend every day learning so that I can look beyond the obvious and view treatment in a more holistic and sustainable way.

Fast forward to today: I’ve gone beyond my work as an EMT in my recent positions in health care. I worked as a medical scribe in the emergency room of a major hospital in New York – immediately after graduation, immediately at the onset of Covid. A trial by fire. I also assisted a primary care physician when his office was inundated with patients at the peak of the pandemic. Shadowing him, discussing treatment options, and interacting with patients one-on-one expanded my knowledge of day-to-day patient care within today’s health-care system. All of these experiences – including my current position as a medical assistant at Jefferson Headache Center – have strengthened my desire to aid patients in building confidence and finding strength as they advance through recovery. 

Despite all the suffering I witnessed during the pandemic, it reinforced what I knew about myself from the start: I am meant to be in health care. I want the larger role of direct patient diagnosis, treatment, and care. I want to keep the individual person in front me at the forefront of decision-making to ensure the best outcome. I know a career in medicine means a lifetime of continuous learning and I am committed to that. I have only just gotten started. 

When I look back on the first call that inspired me to sharpen my skills as an EMT, on the grieving mother who used alcohol to numb her pain, and on every patient interaction since, I realize that they all set me on the path to become a physician. I witnessed the color come back into the cheeks of a young mother and brought comfort to a woman who’d lost her son – even when it meant simply holding her hand. I am ready to do more.","I recently volunteered at Prevention Point, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit public health organization. It was my first time interacting with people with substance use disorders.Each person I encountered had a story. I listened attentively as the women explained their struggles. I encouraged the women to come back to Prevention Point to get preventative medical care, to exchange needles, and to seek refuge, even for just a few hours.The women thanked me for my kindness and for making simple gestures like asking their names. It was a humbling experience that served as a reminder that most addicts and homeless people are not treated like humans. I recognized their humanity and acknowledged their value as individuals, and I could sense that it meant a lot to them._x000D_

Being the ""other"" in situations will improve my ability to communicate with individuals from all walks of life, giving me the cultural and social foundation I need to succeed in my academic, professional, and personal endeavors.","Over the past few years, I learned that a patient-centered approach to health care allows for informed inquiry and respectful interactions‚Äîand I am committed to providing this kind of culturally sensitive care. As an EMT, I responded to a student having a panic attack. She wanted help, but she explained that her parents do not believe in mental health issues, preventing her from seeking care. Typically, I would transport a patient with her complaints to our local psychiatric center. However, her predicament was unique, and I felt like my hands were tied. Following this call, I familiarized myself with the health and counseling services offered at Fordham, so I could relay accurate and timely referrals to my patients. A career in medicine requires lifelong learning, and by participating in calls like this one, I realized that it is my duty as a physician to learn about issues that might not affect me, so that I can provide realistic treatment plans to those affected.",,,1,"It was my final semester of college. The world shut down and my daily responsibilities dissipated. The devastation of COVID-19 made me aware of the vast disparity in access to health care that hit close to home, my home, The Bronx._x000D_
_x000D_
It was during this time that I began working in two vastly different clinical settings: an emergency room and a primary care office.¬†The juxtaposition of health outcomes between patients with and without primary care doctors was glaring. Patients lacking primary care doctors were on their own, so they flooded ERs‚Äîsometimes with non-emergent issues, sometimes when it was too late._x000D_
_x000D_
The pandemic impressed upon me the need to think strategically about the patients in front of me: yes, take care of their immediate needs, but more importantly, understand the circumstances that have contributed to their health outcomes. I was able to pause and reflect on my responsibilities as an aspiring doctor, ultimately sparking my interest in primary care and public health.",1,1,2

Remember, grandma?” I asked as I helped her from the car. She stared at me blankly. Her inability to recognize the face of her only grandson made my heart ache, causing me to fearfully anticipate her diagnosis from our long-time primary care physician. “It seems to be dementia, potentially Alzheimer’s disease,” he confirmed. I sat silently, failing to appreciate what that meant, apart from what I had seen on television. Our doctor noticed my concern, pulled out a blank sheet of paper, and started drawing a diagram, showing me the condition in my grandmother’s brain. At first, I was intimidated and unsure I could understand, but as he kept going, I found myself more engaged. For the next 45 minutes, we discussed the diagnosis, different treatments, and resources for moving forward. I entered his office that day feeling overwhelmed and nervous, and I left feeling empowered and hopeful. 

This epiphany remained with me during my job stocking shelves at Target. On my break, I watched an episode of 60 Minutes, where a segment detailing an experimental treatment for glioblastoma caught my attention. My interaction with my grandmother’s doctor left me drawn to the interviews with physicians and researchers explaining how their treatment could alleviate a devastating brain tumor. Conversations with patients and family members offered a heartbreaking peek into the uncertainty of living with or caring for someone with a potentially untreatable illness. The commonalities between the program and my grandmother’s appointment struck me. That day fostered my conviction to become the person who communicates the complex physiological processes responsible for disease to intimidated patients and loved ones afraid of the unknown by joining the world of medicine.

Before deciding to explore medicine at the age of twenty-five, I spent my early twenties waffling about my path. I bounced in and out of school, tried to follow my father’s footsteps in construction, and thought maybe retail was where I should be, yet nothing ever stuck. Moving forward, I chose to major in biology at my local junior college, feeling optimistic about the journey ahead.

My newfound passion for science and medicine led to an entirely different educational experience, and later I developed a love for research. I showed up each day at the Cellular and Molecular Brain Research Laboratory excited to continue uncovering the novel molecular mechanisms responsible for Alzheimer’s disease. After being drawn to the laboratory because of my grandmother’s struggles, I quickly took to reading new scientific literature and heading my own project that I eventually presented at the 49th annual Society for Neuroscience Conference. Throughout the process, I found value in learning how to break down complex scientific details into a digestible, cohesive story my audience can follow, just as my grandmother’s physician so eagerly and succinctly did for me. These moments further inspired my drive to attend medical school and become a physician who understands, utilizes, and effectively translates scientific evidence to treat and empower my patients.

During my last year of undergrad, the world shut down. COVID-19 spread to my hometown in Las Vegas, causing fear and panic in the community. While working late in the lab, I received an email asking for help at University Medical Center. “…The new lab has a processing capacity of 10,000 tests, but there is a bottleneck with lab technicians that is hampering progress in fighting COVID-19. We are looking for experienced laboratory personnel...” Before I finished reading, I knew this was a way I could be of service. I immediately applied and was rushed into a high-volume medical laboratory. My family's pleas rang in my ears as I stepped into the secured virus extraction area. “You’re going to be exposed! It might not be safe!” Even with the risks, I was enthusiastic about working 12-hour shifts and staying overtime to get patient results out. I called trauma, surgery, admitting floors, pediatric emergency etc., to help inform providers' decision-making. Working behind the scenes provided insight into the vast interprofessional team dedicated to patient care and increased my motivation to attend medical school.

Watching my grandmother lose her independence to an unseen force will remain with me forever. Because of her physician I will always associate the white coat he wore with security. My hope is to emulate the thoughtful practitioner who guided my grandmother and family through her devastating illness, demystifying details I now comprehend and therefore no longer fear. Through my experiences, I have gained the ability to convey intricate scientific information, while developing a compassionate and caring hand to illuminate the darkest paths during life’s most vulnerable moments.","While working in retail I saw the significant stress facing economically disadvantaged members of my community. Although we all have the same twenty-four hours, the clock moves at a quicker pace when you lack transportation. Having your own means of transportation means you can readily estimate your commute. My colleagues who relied on alternative modes of transportation were met with unreliable treks causing their work life to bleed into every facet of their lives at home. I also saw how limited access to healthcare and low wages force agonizing decisions. I witnessed coworkers faced with health scares struggle to establish much needed care. There also came choices between losing pay or attending critical appointments. Simple decisions to prioritize one‚Äôs health turned into fraught situations of uncertainty. From this experience, I empathize with the unseen struggles facing many of my neighbors and the importance of resources to assist disadvantaged members of our communities.","When I was first assigned to my foster child as a Court Appointed Special Advocate, I identified two problems I wished to solve. First, knowing he lacked stable role models, I wished to serve as source of stability. Second, he had not attended school in over a year. His team and I needed to get him help to reintegrate back into school. I accomplished my first task by meeting with him regularly and actively engaging in his interests. We played football at the park and spent weekends at the movies. We became close friends, and when he was in need, I was the first person his foster mom dialed. To help him successfully transition back to school, his team and I enrolled him into mock school days to reacclimate back to regular attendance. We also sought ABA therapy to improve his interactions with peers. If he ever needed help, I offered a steady hand to grasp. His hard work paid off as he successfully reintegrated back into life as a middle schooler, making friends and doing homework.",,,1,"I shadowed three physicians of different disciplines gaining insights into the roles, expectations, and qualities of each physician I followed. These experiences were not easy to come by. During the pandemic, and even with the easing of restrictions since, local medical offices have not been open to unaffiliated visitors. When I spoke to physicians, they expressed concern over the time they had to commit to student shadowing due to increased workloads and time limits set by office administrators. The physicians who were able to accommodate me were incredibly generous with their time. They welcomed me into their office, provided opportunities to answer my questions, and gave detailed breakdowns of their interactions with patients. As documented elsewhere in my application I have significant healthcare/clinical experience as a member of the COVID-19 Laboratory at University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. I hope my time there will be considered when reviewing my clinical experience.",1,1,2

The tragedies were heart-wrenching and intense, but I loved working for a forensic and general psychiatrist and appreciate the biopsychosocial aspects involved in pathology and healthcare. Though I initially began shadowing during free time between classes, I was soon offered an internship; the physician took me through every step of her profession and eventually entrusted me with handling the rest as office manager. 

I recall coming across a patient's chart, Mr. S, who had a large outstanding balance. I noticed that he was listed as self-pay while he had in-network insurance. After hours of phone calls and testing claims in the office, I ultimately managed to reduce his balance to less than half, saving him hundreds of dollars. Mr. S cried when given this news; he could not believe that a stranger had gone the extra mile for him and how much of a burden was now relieved. Even though I was not directly treating patients, I made a positive impact in my role and never took that lightly.

Remarkably by chance, I had the opportunity to experience the “aftermath” of a case and was able to be involved in a different way. For few months during my time as office manager, I also babysat Mrs. Z's foster children. They were three out of seven children of a schizophrenic mom and abusive dad whose parental rights were revoked. Mrs. Z. often complained that they were cold, ungrateful, aggressive children who ""didn’t even care when their cat died of cancer”. However, the day after the cat’s passing, the middle child came home shouting for his cat; I watched his eyes gradually dim as he realized that his pet was truly gone. He asked me why cats don’t have cemeteries and what happens to them in the afterlife. Through keen observation, I saw their soft hearts work in little ways, such as when the oldest asked me for money for candy from a vending machine, which she used to buy me a treat as a ""thank you” for taking them out that day. 

Though, at first, the kids would  immediately retreat to their rooms after school, I took the time to visit their rooms to greet and hug them. Over time, they came to anticipate these gestures. Mrs. Z. was astounded when all three began to initiate hugs when it was time for me to leave. As I gave them space to share at their own pace, I realized that just because they hadn’t cried didn’t mean that they were ambivalent towards their cat’s passing; just because they did not explicitly say ‘thank you’, didn’t mean that they were ungrateful for the lunch outing. They had been formed based on their life experiences and expressed things differently, in a way that required more observance. The effects of paying attention to people,  allowing them to share on their own terms, and understanding that they may present or express things in a unique way are critical pillars to medicine. For successful treatment, patients need to feel validated by their providers, be part of the decision-making, and have trust in their physician and the progression in their health.

These experiences throughout the years reinforced my desire to pursue medicine, though I struggled through my time as an undergraduate student. Recognizing the need to improve, I tackled my weaknesses, excelled in my studies, and earned a masters in biomedical sciences. I took and retook the MCAT. Currently, I am a medical assistant for over a dozen physicians that specialize in orthopedic surgery, sports medicine, pain management, and podiatry. I enjoy interacting with patients, working with the various doctors, and even studying the physical exam tests, diagnoses and procedures I encounter on the job. Each day, I implement the skills that I have cultivated throughout all of my past activities, especially my dedication to the patients' best interests and listening to the unique story of each individual.

Towards the end of 2021, my younger brother received treatment for his wrist after a tennis injury by one of the orthopedic surgeons in the practice, Dr. Goldberger. I had discreetly approached the billing department prior, asking them to give me the bill instead of my parents, for my family does not have health insurance. When Dr. Goldberger caught wind of this, he ensured that my brother’s treatment be regarded as professional courtesy, free of charge. He showed me the impact of physicians truly caring about their patients and patients’ families.

The interactions and experiences I have had and continue to have foster my goals and desire to pursue medicine. They have illuminated the benefit of giving others the chance to express themselves and hear their stories, while observing what lies beneath the surface. I work hard to be like Dr. Goldberger, as I have witnessed patients that he treated periodically for different injuries and ailments over the years vocalize their complete trust in him.  Rather than be a financial burden, I will continue harnessing traits to serve as a resource for patients to achieve the best version of themselves. I am prepared for the next step, not just to achieve, but to excel in my pursuits.","Earlier this year, as a newly employed medical assistant (MA) in a practice with pre-dominantly Jewish doctors and patients, I encountered a Hasidic Jewish patient, ‚ÄúMrs. B‚Äù, who hesitated upon seeing me when I called her name from the waiting room. Then, simultaneously, we noticed that we were both wearing lavender head covers and laughed. Now, she and I effortlessly catch up at each office visit, as she loves to show me family photos. _x000D_

Further, I have served as the bridge between my primarily Arabic-speaking parents and the communities I grew up in.

My role of teaching and advocacy will also extend to the Rush and Chicago community. I look forward to embracing differences, discovering similarities and growing in perspective through interactions with fellow students and colleagues.","One New Year‚Äôs Day, a friend and I were walking behind an elderly couple with their grandson on our way out of the movie theater. Suddenly, the older woman fell forward on the concrete; her glasses shattered, leaving her face cut and bloody. Instantly, I ran to her and¬†supported her head on my lap as I instructed my friend to call the police. I tore a piece of fabric from my hijab and used it to apply pressure. I asked the woman questions to assess if she was oriented in order to discern whether she tripped or if there was an underlying medical reason for her fall. I assured the husband and grandson, and asked them about the movie they watched to distract from the overwhelming commotion. I continued care until first responders transported her to the hospital.¬† The experience reinforced my faith that I was on the right path to become a physician and inspired me to continue learning so that I am even more prepared for potential, similar emergencies in the future.

Whoever scored next would win the game. The ball was in our half, and I was covering in our defensive shape. As soon as we won possession of the ball, I set off. As the midfielder, I was the balance between offense and defense. It was my responsibility to drop back and push forward. It was my duty to cover the entire field. That day, I made myself open for a pass down the sideline, took a quick scan, and played in the pass for the game-winning strike. The next thing I knew, our bench cleared, and I was wrestled to the ground by my teammates.
Playing in the midfield goes far beyond soccer for me. I not only play in the middle; I live in the middle—at an intersection—and from that space, I embrace the different worlds that surround me. By appearance, I am an Arab. By voice, I am an American. By culture, I am an American, a Palestinian, an Arab, and an Israeli. My being is the direct product of multiple cultures and one world.
Medicine also represents an intersection—of sciences, academic disciplines, methodologies, treatment modalities, and cultures. Physicians strive to understand every patient who walks through their doors. They provide a level of service that not only meets professional needs but also recognizes cultural differences. Physicians touch the lives of people from all over the world and must be prepared to give the specific treatments those patients need.
This hit home in a new way during a week of celebrations in my family. My sister Amani was getting married, and all my family, scattered across the world, came to Alaska to attend. My other sister, Nashwa, and her husband, Taher, were among the family flying in from Israel. On the third day of festivities, Taher woke up with an extremely rapid heartrate, and we rushed him to the hospital. The emergency department only allowed one visitor, so I stayed in the car. Taher was otherwise healthy and only 35, making it unusual that he was having these symptoms. As I sat and waited, Nashwa sent me photos of his EKG readings. I had seen EKGs before but only knew basic rhythms and the characteristics of p-waves, QRS complexes, and t-waves. I tried to analyze his rhythm, so I could give Nashwa some comfort, and although I wasn’t sure of Taher’s diagnosis, I could immediately tell his results weren’t normal.
Taher was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (a-fib), and this experience inspired me to become a cardiac medical assistant (MA) as a step on my journey to medical school. As a cardiac MA, I provide Holter monitor studies, report critical EKGs, collect pacemaker transmissions, and communicate with nurses, schedulers, technicians, and providers. I have also learned from our patients and begun to understand how much more there is to treating a patient than medicine. Some patients need translators, for instance, while others have never used advanced technology or are uncomfortable putting on monitors.
One such patient was terrified of her Holter monitor she had just received. “I have no idea why I’m even getting this and don’t want it to be affecting my heart,” she said, in a faltering voice. “My heart recently felt like it was going to beat of my chest because it was going so fast. I don’t want this to speed it up faster.”
I was initially confused by her fear, since the monitor was harmless, and unsure what to say. Then I placed myself in her position— as someone who knew something was wrong and was vulnerable and reliant on others for answers, like my sister and Taher had been in the ER. I explained to the patient that the device would not give off an electrical impulse but would only read her heart rhythm. I shared with her how my brother in-law used a monitor, like the one she had, to further analyze his a-fib. She relaxed and decided to wear the monitor.
Shadowing physicians, and volunteering at Ronald McDonald House Charities, have also exposed me not only to the problem-solving aspect of medicine but also to the personal connection needed to treat each patient’s unique needs. Dr. Mamikunian, an otolaryngologist, and Dr. Zumbro, and ophthalmologist, introduced me to their specialties and surgeries, including tonsillectomies and LASIK, respectively. More importantly, they showed me how to communicate medical knowledge within the medical community and with patients of different cultural and economic backgrounds. Physicians are professional and empathetic to each person’s needs, and they build relationships with patients that extend through post-op visits and beyond.
My goal in pursuing a career in medicine is to use my multicultural background and life experiences to connect with all patients and treat them to the best of my ability. Physicians are problem-solvers, responsive, there to listen, and able to tailor their healing methods to each patient’s needs; something that fits who I am and something that I haven’t found in any other profession. As a physician, I am confident that I would enjoy the problem-solving aspect of medicine, and that my background would enable me to empathize with my patients in order to provide them with the utmost care.","During my junior year, I visited impoverished South African townships for a soccer mission. Azoma, was one of the soccer attendees I was coaching, and when we first met, it was difficult to communicate. Azoma was reserved and hesitant in his answers when I asked him what his hobbies were. These types of questions felt uncomfortable because of our distinct upbringings. However, after a couple of days of soccer camp our bond grew stronger, and it felt like I knew Azoma for years. Even though we looked and grew up differently, we found common ground when we kicked a ball together. Soccer was our muse and our discussions regarding soccer opened the door to other topics as each day passed. Working together and sharing meaningful experiences was a way for people in South Africa to connect with others in their communities, and Azoma taught me this. People like Azoma inspired me to look for common ground between myself and others who represent different cultures, languages, and identities.","I volunteer as a soccer coach for the 90+ Project. 90+ offers soccer training and equipment to under-resourced urban youth and has become a medium for me to connect with diverse populations. While coaching, I began to further understand what it meant to be from an underserved community: individuals do not physically have the resources to reach their fullest intellectual, economic, or health potential. As a coach, I prioritize understanding these differences and adapt my communication and service. I believe soccer can be used as a tool to make a positive impact in my players‚Äô daily lives and in their social and structural determinants of health. Thus, while I coach, I strive to use soccer to promote a spirit of community, develop character, and enable anyone to reach their fullest intellectual and athletic potential ‚Äì regardless of their economic or cultural background.",,,1,"My initial plans for the summers of 2019 and 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, were to first join a research internship and then become a medical scribe.

I also prepared myself to only take one gap year, where I would be working throughout the 2021-2022 application cycle, but my focus on trying to fit in my other opportunities forced me to have to take at least two gap years. Finally, in the summer of 2021, I was able to secure a research position on a novel drug treatment for Huntington's Disease. After my summer research, I became a cardiac medical assistant.

Living without health insurance meant that most of our ailments were treated with home remedies, and my immediate and extended family avoided encounters with hospitals due to the potential cost and threats. Because my parents had limited education, they were not able to help my siblings and me much with school work or processes such as applying to college. Once I got to college, I struggled to find a community and connect to campus since my peers did not share the difficulties I faced.

Once he comes across information he thinks is true, he can’t be convinced otherwise. While this is mostly humorous in our family, his stubbornness is less entertaining when it comes to his health. Like many men in Mexican culture, he avoids seeking healthcare, not out of fear, but because he is, of course, too macho to be persuaded to change his ways. Not to mention he sticks to habits like drinking 6 cans of soda a day and eating high cholesterol and high sugar foods. While it is easy for me to become frustrated at his continuous detrimental habits, I can’t help but feel sad that I haven’t found a way to encourage him to change his lifestyle to improve his health. I have encountered patients who, like my tío, have not learned to be conscientious enough to improve their health and not get carried away by myths. It was during a health psychology class that I began to tie together the instances of my life when I saw the health of those close to me suffer due to a lack of education and self-awareness. Volunteering in health and mental health workshops in my community helped me see the power misinformation can hold and how it can perpetuate dangerous habits and lifestyles. I want to be a physician who serves communities like my own and who can collaborate with men like my tio and women who shy away from seeking the help they desperately need due to the many social determinants of health. I hope to bring my perspective to this field and return to my community to work to shift the narrative around medicine.
My mom once told me about her friend whose oral cancer was discovered after an oral surgery. Rumors spread among my family and friends that going to the dentist gives them cancer, causing them to stop going to the dentist altogether. Even though I knew this was not true, I wasn’t able to speak confidently on the topic because I lacked the knowledge and experience. I consulted with my physiology professor, who was an M.D., and he taught me the language to explain that the trip to the dentist could not have caused the cancer. Equipped with the scientific and culturally appropriate explanation, I was able to spread accurate information with more credibility by using the same method that perpetuated the rumor in the first place: word of mouth. With the knowledge and experience I’ll gain in medical school, I will work to prevent the spread of misinformation by using public health strategies to help people in underserved regions make good choices about their health. As a member of the community I can begin to rebuild trust in healthcare through community health efforts and working individually with patients and families in marginalized populations.
Having grown up hearing and living by the teachings of my church, I learned to treat people with differing beliefs with a high degree of respect. This shapes the way that I approach others in all settings, but especially in medicine. While working the front desk of a clinic I had a patient who came in wearing a face mask that said “against my will,” making it clear that she did not agree with wearing a mask. Part of my job was to enforce safety guidelines during the pandemic, but I tried to always behave professionally and with sensitivity to everyone's beliefs. Even if they had an opinion I did not agree with I saw no need to argue, I listened attentively and sometimes even learned something new. It was and will continue to be important to me for patients to know that I respect their opinions. Even if they have differing opinions I never want to be dismissive since ultimately they are the ones in control of their health decisions. I want to be humble and attentive to what my patients have to say to build up that trust that leads them to better health outcomes without disrespecting or imposing my beliefs on them.
Being undocumented, I have become aware of the countless barriers to access in healthcare and education. It starts with something as minimal as asking for a social security number on check-in forms to providers being insensitive to the specific legal, financial and cultural situation of the patient when treating them. These small instances can lead the patient to refrain from being open with the provider, resulting in a delay of their care. I have heard many family members and friends say they didn’t speak openly to their doctors because the doctor simply didn’t understand them. I was very impacted on an occasion when I attended a graduation ceremony and the class speaker mentioned in her speech “My legal status does not determine my character.” I have always had lingering feelings of unworthiness for the style of life I have here in the United States and often refrain from letting others know my legal status because of an unconscious fear that they’d make up their minds about me without actually knowing me. I have since applied what the class speaker said that day to my life as I hope to apply it to my medical practice: I want to create a safe space for those like me where they will not have to worry that their livelihood is in danger for sharing with their doctor and where they can speak to their provider knowing they will be listened and attended to with the proper dignity and respect.","Up until high school I had mostly been surrounded by people who shared my culture, whether it be at my home, school or church. Even though UCSD was only 30 minutes away from home, there was a drastic change in the people I interacted with and my perspective on the world changed as well. I was caught off guard by the puzzled looks when I shared my experiences or customs and even more so by the differences between my perspectives and those of my peers. I found myself wanting to learn more and expose myself to more outlooks on life. Attending university gave me many valuable experiences and opportunities, but one of the most important to me is the realization that by learning from others and listening to their points of view is how we can grow and create environments that foster individuality, collaboration and a high degree of respect for one another. I want to build on this more by serving Chicago‚Äôs diverse communities and learning from them how to provide equitable and excellent care.","When I tutored for a free community program I saw the effects of educational disparities on the well-being and academic performance of the kids. As a tutor I was involved in working to improve the program and was later given the opportunity to be the program coordinator. I constantly looked for ways to motivate the tutors, encourage our students and obtain better resources. I was moved by the improvement in the students I tutored and their excitement in seeing it themselves. Too often in Latino culture there is a belief that some people just aren‚Äôt cut out for school and I sometimes heard the kids express these sentiments about themselves. By consistently telling them that they were capable and providing the extra help they needed I was thrilled to see them begin to believe in themselves and achieve the goals that initially seemed too far. I want to keep being involved in uplifting disadvantaged individuals and using my knowledge and experience to serve them in any way possible.",,,1,"At the start of the pandemic all my volunteer opportunities ceased. I was fortunate that my job in a primary care clinic did not close, but the constant changes in protocol and safety concerns made it difficult to do our jobs. In 2020 three of my uncles passed away and the pandemic made healing difficult with impacted funeral homes and long wait times. After this I had to adjust to online learning in my post bacc program with the added pressure of a full course load of upper division science classes. It was difficult to not be able to bond with my classmates as we would have in person. While the pandemic created stressful environments for me, I acknowledge the immense loss and difficulty that others experienced as a result of it and I am grateful for the opportunity to continue pursuing my goals.",1,0,2

My mom did what she could to maintain a stable household but battled unemployment, hypothyroidism, and many other challenges. I largely supported myself financially since I started babysitting at 14 and, at times, have had to raise my mom alongside myself. Without public assistance and generous individuals, I do not know where we would be. A different landlord would have evicted us years ago, and the woman I babysat for did not need to buy me my laptop for college. Without a Pell Grant and Bright Futures Scholarship, I would have stayed home and attended community college. When my grandfather died of cancer in June 2018, he left my grandmother in financial ruin with immense debts to the IRS. I spent huge amounts of time after his death preparing her for the end of the national CDC eviction moratorium on August 26th, 2021. His death offered my mom the freedom to pursue her first passionate work and start her climb out of a mountain of debt.

Despite every reason to pursue abortion and with nobody by her side, she selflessly chose to give up so much of her life to raise me. She always gave enough love for two parents and made the most of what little we had. The challenges we faced due to her lack of college education taught me to take nothing for granted and appreciate the opportunities that education provides. Though I cannot repay that sacrifice or return her to the prime of her life, I vowed not to let her efforts go in vain and to tread a path in which I could positively impact those who need it most.
We dealt with unstable access to affordable healthcare, which at times has been a major obstacle for us both. When I was 12, my mom and stepdad divorced, leaving me with incomplete dental care that would worsen over the years. The troubled teeth in my mouth served as a constant, aching reminder of the realities of life without affordable healthcare.  Knowing I am among the minority living in one of the most prosperous nations on Earth, it bewildered me to imagine how debilitating illnesses must be for those without access to healthcare. Seeing the humanitarian efforts of Doctors Without Borders/MSF and other aid workers on Reddit rooted a desire to learn more about the world and leave an impact where it is needed most.
Years later, while studying abroad at the University of Hull, I attended a presentation with MSF nurse Andy Dennis. He described the miraculous recoveries he witnessed patients make and the tremendous victories that would not have been possible without their efforts. What impacted me most, however, is the story of one young girl who, despite all the best judgment calls made, eventually succumbed to Ebola. The image of her makeshift palm frond cross will forever resonate with me. I felt fortunate to be made aware of the horrifying realities countless others face. He showed me the stunning disparity in health and medical conditions worldwide and the massive impacts possible for a relatively low cost. Reflecting on life's fragility, I understood that failing to pursue a career in healthcare could realistically translate to lives lost. With tears in my eyes, I shook Mr. Dennis’ hand and thanked him for giving me absolute faith in the path I planned to pursue. He inspired me to bring this platform home, and I began hard at work founding the Friends of MSF at FIU. It is a student organization I hoped would inspire my peers and raise awareness surrounding public health crises and humanitarian efforts.
After graduation, I was eager for more exposure to medicine and the day-to-day hum of the real world. Scribing full-time in a breast cancer clinic has awarded me both. Walking through the oncology floor is a humbling experience that instills gratitude for life into me every day. The hope and resilience demonstrated by patients in the most challenging moments of their lives is incredibly inspiring. Attending goals of care conferences for terminal cancer patients offered me an appreciation for just how much patients and their families look to physicians for support and guidance. I was touched by how the doctors provided comfort and relief by focusing on the positives of pursuing a peaceful passing in which the patient’s loved ones could accompany them. Without their physicians’ concerted efforts, the patient’s family would have been much more likely to ""Full Code"" the patient, pursuing unreasonable lifesaving efforts that would only bring more pain. This experience brought me back to the loss of my grandpa to terminal lung cancer and the lengths my family pursued to keep him from hospice. I am sure that only as a physician will I be in the strongest position to fight for patients and their families, even if that fight means advocating for a peaceful passing.
Long train rides offered me ample time to reflect on my motivations. I have found that efforts made toward improving patients' lives are always worthwhile. Scribing has embedded doubts that any other career will keep me as satisfied and motivated as advocating for patients as a physician. Though my passion for preventative medicine will never leave me, I appreciate with equal importance the extra six months awarded to a terminal cancer patient. I am eager to discover the new perspective and lessons offered by each specialty and facet of medicine. Patients need someone to fight for them. Medicine allows me to advocate for patients, empower them to make substantial changes in their life, and learn from them. The variety of patient encounters often leaves me grappling with my mortality. I feel constant reminders of the sanctity of life and the importance of cherishing each moment and experience. I am left dumbfounded when I try to perceive the magnitude of suffering prevented for patients and their loved ones over a physician’s career. That is a monumental impact that I would be proud to leave.","I was raised by my single mom and grew up around my sisters, grandmother, and their pink appliances. I have been frequently labeled as a ""feminine"" man for not conforming to many gender norms men are often expected to. Female friends compliment my ability to pick up on subtle cues of discomfort. Without strong male models, I largely taught myself how to be a strong man through literature, rap music, video games, and Reddit forums. These sources exposed me to perspectives and realities very different from my own. As a minority in my predominantly Black high school and Hispanic college, I experienced different cultural values and connected with people unlike myself. I gained awareness of my own privilege and found the confidence to face uncomfortable conversations. Engaging with a mutual sense of humanity has helped me be vulnerable with new people, create more intimate relationships, and achieve deeper insight into the experiences of the people around me.","Through my work with the Friends of MSF I exposed my FIU peers to the extent of preventable deaths worldwide, which only cemented my own strong desire to pursue a global health pathway. The COVID pandemic became a focal point of conversations, illuminating how unprepared the world is for infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries. We emphasized that public health decisions should never be politicized and that more discussions surrounding social determinants of health and health policy reform are necessary. Most of all, efforts should be made through evidence-based, patient-centered policies and through community-guided efforts facilitated by physicians. _x000D_
I also mobilized the Friends of MSF at FIU in various fundraising, advocacy, and volunteering efforts. I organized trips to visit detained immigrants at the local ICE Detention Center in order to provide a dose of humanity to people who may have not seen a loved one for months or years. ",,,1,"COVID prevented the FoMSF at FIU from ever having an official in-person meeting. Despite immense efforts, we eventually had to make do with a virtual environment. Also, all 6 of my roommates began occupying our 4 bedroom house at all times. We were constantly subject to everyone‚Äôs habits and messes. Staying on top of chores and conflict resolution was very important. Tension rose in confinement, especially with our varying levels of concern for COVID. Volunteering and shadowing opportunities also became limited, affecting my ability to serve the community and limiting FoMSF at FIU's ability to engage members sharing these intentions. My mother and grandmother faced limited employment opportunities during this time and relied on me even more than usual for monetary and physical support. Specifically, my grandmother's eviction was delayed by the COVID eviction moratorium. This helped her stay home longer, but also meant I had to return home for long periods to help her move.",1,0,2

I kicked the soccer ball as hard as I could, and dust collected around me. As Mateen climbed the neighbor’s fence to retrieve the ball, he fell and gashed his leg against metal protruding from the fence. I sat by his side as my brother ran to get help. My family and I were visiting my aunt in Mafinabad, a small Iranian village. The nearest doctor was miles away in the city, so my aunt tended to his wound at home. The next morning, Mateen was running a high fever and had to be driven to the hospital by another relative. Over the years, I was reminded of the hardships Mateen and his family faced living far from medical centers in Iran, which often led to delayed treatment. Recognizing the negative impact being medically underserved can have on an individual’s health, I started seeking opportunities that allowed me to learn more about medicine and what a physician’s role can be in addressing these issues for their patients.
Inspired to one day address the common barriers patients face in accessing medical care, I decided to explore medicine as an ED scribe at BWMC. My perspectives continued to be challenged as I witnessed patients sitting in overcrowded waiting rooms for several hours before being seen by a provider. Often, those same patients were treated for chronic diseases that had worsened due to a lack of preventative care or proper insurance coverage. I remember preparing diabetes education materials for “Ms. Jay,” a young woman with a history of uncontrolled diabetes who visited the hospital twice in one month. She was uninsured, unable to afford her medication, and worried about the effect that inadequate access to care would have on her health. As a single mother of two, she found herself struggling to raise her daughters while looking for work. I felt frustrated by her situation, knowing that the challenges she endured involved more than just the cost of care. She required a different social, physical, and economic environment to reach her full health potential. Experiencing the healthcare system from the perspective of patients like Ms. Jay encouraged me to consider how public health advocacy could be integrated into effective healthcare. The reality of what I witnessed as a scribe is that the role of a physician often extends beyond medical care to this critical intersection between public health and medicine. To further build upon my understanding of social determinants of health and bolster my ability to serve as an informed patient advocate, I pursued a Master of Health Science at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
During my graduate studies, I continued to immerse myself in the complex and interrelated socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic factors that influence community and population health while volunteering at a food pantry in Southeast Baltimore. Through this experience, I refined my awareness of how a lack of access to affordable healthy foods and organized transportation can contribute to poor health outcomes. While food giveaways offered a temporary solution to the problem, the underlying causes of food insecurity remained to be addressed by meaningful systems- and policy-level changes. In viewing medicine through a public health lens, I fostered a profound desire to diagnose health problems, determine their root causes, and implement effective interventions. As a physician, I will use my platform to address the health consequences of outdated policies and programs, minimize adverse health effects, and maximize health benefits for all patients.
Part of what drew me to medicine was the opportunity to form interpersonal connections to make a difference not only medically, but by evoking trust and confidence through cultivating relationships. As a medical assistant at the Maryland Pediatric Group, I was able to take my responsibilities further and build deeper connections with patients. I remember meeting “Mia,” an 11-year-old patient due for her vaccines. To help ease her worries, I shared how I overcame similar fears and explained how vaccines train the immune system to recognize and fight “the bad guys.” I was overjoyed when she discovered the shots hurt less than she anticipated and hopped off the exam table for a hug. Moments like this reinforced the importance of listening to the needs of each patient. Looking toward the future, I want my patients to feel that they can confide in me and trust that I have their best interests in mind while being present in their most vulnerable moments.
My clinical, service-learning, and educational experiences strengthened my resolve to become a physician by showing me the impact of healthcare at an individual and community level. Through seeing medicine across a broad spectrum, I understand that patients like Mateen face significant barriers to healthcare. As a doctor, I will play an active role in advancing patient health and reducing health disparities through advocacy and community engagement, particularly among marginalized and underserved groups. I am continually motivated to become a physician as I will have the opportunity to make critical decisions, empower patients, and be directly involved in their care.","During my public health studies in India, I met with Dr. Malagi, the Chair of Ayurvedic Medicine at Kasturba Medical College in Udupi. This was my first time learning about Ayurveda, an alternative form of medicine that originated in India several centuries ago. While used as a complementary therapy at times in the U.S., Ayurveda is the standard of care in many parts of India. Prior to this site visit, I had broadly associated medicine with Western medicine. This experience emphasized the importance of understanding that not everyone views medicine and disease in the same way. I came to appreciate that as a future physician, I may have patients with diverse views of disease pathology, and who may not be in agreement with many conventional treatment options. It is essential that I continue to remain open-minded and respect my patients, and seek to fully understand their preferences, needs, and values. Providing equitable care means ensuring care is culturally sensitive and responsive.","Through service-learning, I have partnered with different community leaders committed to creating a positive impact in their communities. During one of my service-learning projects in Baltimore, I met an elderly gentleman who had previously experienced homelessness and could not access job opportunities and healthcare due to a lack of permanent housing. He explained why the economic landscape of Baltimore contributes to higher rates of homelessness and how he plans to raise awareness about its challenges. After hearing his story, I became even more motivated to seek additional opportunities to support his mission. As a graduate student, I volunteered at a food pantry in Baltimore and organized weekly food giveaways for people experiencing homelessness and food insecurity. Staying engaged in community outreach has enabled me to better understand various external factors that impact people‚Äôs lives significantly. I have also learned the importance of nurturing community relationships.",,,1,"In March 2020, my final quarter as a graduate student moved online, which required adapting to remote learning. I continued to volunteer with Thread and the Alzheimer's Association, while also focusing on my MCAT since my original test date was canceled in response to COVID-19. Instead of holding in-person tutoring sessions at Magellan, I met with students virtually in order to help them set and attain their learning goals. I learned to implement creative strategies to increase student engagement and retention in online courses. I made it a goal to ensure that each student felt heard and understood while adjusting to their new routine. Prior to the start of the pandemic, my current position as a data analyst at Microsoft was in-person; however, it is now fully remote. I found greater purpose in my work as a result of the pandemic, considering the implications of automated clinical note curation. Furthermore, one of my shadowing opportunities in 2021 was halted due to COVID-19.",1,0,1

Waaa!"" Oh no! How do I console this crying toddler? It was 5 P.M.: snack time in Daya Dan, an orphanage for underserved children with physical disabilities, mental disabilities, or both, located in Kolkata, India, run by Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity. Mayu, a two-year-old, refused to let me feed him milk. In my teenage ignorance, I initially thought that reasoning with Mayu would calm him down. I explained to him in Bengali that drinking milk would keep him strong. Unsurprisingly, Mayu kept on sobbing. Since reasoning with Mayu didn't work out too well, I decided to simply soothe him. I patted his smooth head and exclaimed, ""Shaat, shaat"" (this is a Bengali phrase to calm babies). After I had jostled his wobbly cheeks, he stopped crying for a few seconds, so I thought I would finally be able to feed him. I was wrong. Mayu burst into tears and bawled uncontrollably. Nothing seemed to work. I couldn't bear to see him cry. He had no one to call to his own. As I grieved about Mayu's dire situation, I laid my head down on Mayu's arm as he sobbed from his highchair. Surprisingly, Mayu stopped crying, took the milk bottle from my hands, and started drinking. He drank the milk and patted me on the head just like I had patted his head a few minutes back. What a turn of events! I sensed that he understood that I was crestfallen, and thus he patted my head to make me feel better. I witnessed how empathy can lead to a positive outcome. Had I not put myself in Mayu's shoes, Mayu probably would not have connected with me and maybe would not have taken his milk. At Daya Dan, besides feeding children, I washed their clothes, transported them, and helped exercise them. My experience at the orphanage was significant for me as I found providing compassionate care to people with physical or mental disabilities to be very fulfilling.
 
Volunteering at Daya Dan during the summer before my senior year in high school inspired me to pursue a career where I would care for people suffering from ailments that are handicapping or preventing them from achieving the quality of life they desire. During my last semester of high school, I learned of a shadowing opportunity that would take place in the summer following graduation. I had not shadowed a physician before, so I was curious to see whether the duties of physicians matched what I wanted to do in my career. Following a sports medicine physician and an orthopedic surgeon gave me a close-up view of how physicians' care improves patients' conditions. I observed the restored functionality in patients during their surgical follow-up appointments. Seeing physicians' high impact as leaders of healthcare teams on enhancing the well-being of patients struck a chord with me. I realized there's nothing quite like the sense of fulfillment that results from leading a team that works together to heal patients.
 
With a strengthened resolve to care for those with disabling conditions, I entered college with the motivation of addressing an issue that's causing widespread disability in my community: substance use disorders. The opioid epidemic, in particular, has devasted the lives of numerous individuals and their families throughout the nation, especially in Ohio. Determined to address this issue among students at the University of Cincinnati and surrounding underserved communities, I helped lead multiple substance abuse prevention and harm reduction organizations. Upon graduating from college, I continued to address substance use disorders in southwest Ohio by serving in substance abuse prevention and treatment organizations.

A particularly memorable experience I've had while promoting substance abuse prevention techniques was at a church in Lower Price Hill, a diverse underserved neighborhood in Cincinnati ravaged by the opioid epidemic. I helped organize a ""Family Fun Night"" event to bring the children and adults of the community together to learn about safe prescription medicine practices. We first connected with people at the event by learning about their daily lives and having pizza with them. Afterward, we presented cards with colorful illustrations of various medication practices and actively engaged everyone present there by asking questions and leading discussions. As a result, we educated the participants, especially children, in an appealing manner. Upon witnessing the children's enthusiastic participation, the church manager gratefully explained that we were role models in a community where substance abuse among adults was rampant. It struck me how teaching concepts in a simple manner can have a beneficial impact. This revelation further inspired me to become a physician— a healer who connects with and guides patients and cooperates with them to facilitate their healing.

Inspired by my transformative experience at Daya Dan, I have continued to engage in experiences that have strengthened my desire to heal those with disabling ailments. These experiences and my rigorous academic pursuits have given me a strong motivation and foundation to persevere through medical training. As an aspiring physician, I hope to provide compassionate care to my potential patients and help alleviate their suffering from their illnesses and disabilities.","As an Addiction Navigator, I helped patients who had substance use disorders or were at risk of developing them. A specific patient I interacted with came to the hospital due to extended constipation. Upon screening him, I discovered that he was addicted to pain medications from his previous surgery. Initially, I was afraid I would not be able to connect with him since I am a young person from a relatively well-off suburb, whereas the patient was an older person from an underserved Appalachian county. I, however, did not let our differences hinder my care for him. I empathetically explained to him that I understood the hassle and stigma of treating addiction but that preventing his addiction from spiraling out of control was imperative. As a result, I successfully convinced him to seek treatment at an addiction treatment center. From this experience, I learned that having empathy toward others in distress can substantially help them, even if their backgrounds differ from mine.","I hope to contribute to Rush‚Äôs commitment to improving the societal and structural determinants of health in Chicago‚Äôs west side neighborhoods with my interest in encouraging individuals to appreciate each other's diverse backgrounds and thought processes. When I was the Diversity Council Chairman of my residence hall complex in college, I impacted the complex‚Äôs community by planning events that cultivated inclusivity among residents. One such memorable event was ""The Culture Cookout,"" where residents immersed themselves in appreciating different cultures by learning about different customs and tasting various cultural foods.  Inspired by this experience, as a potential medical student, I hope to build bridges between the diverse students of Rush Medical College. Appreciating each other's varied experiences will, in turn, help us understand Chicago‚Äôs west side neighborhoods better and thus inspire us to serve compassionately as healers and advocates of equity in these neighborhoods.",,,1,"I have been fortunate not to be severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic._x000D_

But after the fifth time ‘Rodney’ returned to our exam room at LifeLong Medical Care to have his right leg wound debrided and dressed, it became clear that was exactly what Dr. E was doing. Rodney had already lost his left leg to a combination of uncontrolled diabetes and osteomyelitis. Depression and apathy stemming from Rodney’s first amputation and sustained status as houseless had eroded his motivation to practice self-care. Now, his medical non-adherence resulted in our fear that his remaining leg would follow the same trajectory. As a scribe, I initially felt impotent sitting behind my desk, desperate to know enough about medicine and wound care to help the man ten feet in front of me. However, my tenure at LifeLong taught me that there is more to treating patients than the practical application of medical knowledge. 

When I took introductory Organic Chemistry, I first learned the extent to which every physical process can be broken down into increasingly smaller components. After peeking behind the curtain of the building blocks of life, I realized my desire to understand biological systems at the smallest level. I was no longer satisfied with simplified or abridged explanations. Three weeks into the course, I filed a petition to change my major from biology to biochemistry. Later in college, when I discovered Bioethics Debate Club, I realized my need to know the underlying ‘why’ behind everything extended beyond physiology to the thoughts and behaviors of people. I learned to see things through someone else’s lens and uncover the values, biases, and motivations that are often the source of conflict and misunderstanding. 

I saw the value of this insight into the human psyche as Dr. E patiently worked with Rodney to understand his history of non-adherence. Hoping to emulate Dr. E’s attentiveness, I began keeping a journal of patients’ notable life changes to better engage them next visit. I yearned to surmount my preconception that scribes should be inconspicuous shadows and felt a small triumph whenever I was able to distract a nervous patient by coaxing a story out of them. This juxtaposition of the human and academic sides of medicine solidified my goal to combine this newfound avenue of healing with my desire to be at the forefront of the medical field.

Making volunteer calls at Sanctuary Hospice also let me work within my limitations to help people. ‘Rose’, the granddaughter and now live-in caregiver of one of our patients suffering from dementia, had for the past two months appreciated my weekly respite calls as disruptions to the monotony of pandemic-induced isolation. One afternoon, however, when she returned my initial greeting in an uncharacteristically distant voice, I knew something was wrong. She abruptly broke into tears and took a few tries to start her next sentence. She confided in me that she had been sexually assaulted, then lapsed into a panic attack. When Rose told me that she had been unable to share her trauma with anyone besides me, her essentially anonymous weekly confidant, I was struck by the gravity of my position and the potential impact of my next words. I was terrified of saying the wrong thing, but I knew I had to push past my hesitation in order to provide the kind of help Rose needed in that moment. Doing this gave me a glimpse into the similar duty of doctors to prioritize a patient’s needs despite any personal trepidation.

I began by walking her through grounding techniques. Over the next hour, our conversation evolved to her anxiety about finding post-graduate work as an artist, then to the curiosity about musicians sounding better on a recording than in concert. Later that day, I resumed studying physiology but found my thoughts returning to our earlier conversation. While I felt a sense of pride after helping Rose find even a momentary respite from her trauma, I struggled to cope with my inability to alleviate the suffering that would surely dominate her immediate future. This was my first lesson in accepting my limitations while resolving not to let this deter me from providing any kind of aid to my fullest capability. 

Growing up, I sustained a genuine if unrefined aspiration to become a doctor. It was not until scribing at LifeLong Medical Care that my enduring love of medicine crystalized into a passion. My time here has elucidated a drive to work for patients like those in East Oakland, where I can return some degree of equity to the lives of those often overlooked by our healthcare system. Rodney eventually got his infection under control and kept his leg. Though it was impossible to ignore his remaining myriad of social and medical issues, I learned to take satisfaction in the small victories, owed that day to Dr. E’s determination to heal rather than fix. After the umpteenth patient exclaimed to her some variation of “I’m so lucky I found a doctor like you,” I realized that is what I want above all else. I want to be a doctor that patients feel lucky to have found.","Scribing at a Community Health Center illuminated how my privileges shaped my preconceptions about the role of a patient. I expected every patient to comply with their doctor‚Äôs instructions because I had been raised to do so. Instead, I saw patients not completing their labs and imaging and not tending to their infected wounds. Talking with patients and learning about their lives over many visits uncovered that a lack of financial resources or an inadequate social support system were most often responsible for any medical non-adherence. Single parents in a chaotic household cannot simply stop walking on their wounded leg because a doctor says it is necessary. It is almost impossible to prioritize one‚Äôs blood sugar when one doesn‚Äôt have stable housing or guaranteed meals.

Teaching 1st-grade Hispanic students how to read in an underfunded elementary school made me confront the marginalization faced by children in families without social capital.

2023,15067615,,24,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"Since the time my family and I immigrated to the United States, we have been on Medicaid. As a family of four, our yearly income averaged around 18,000 dollars. I am also a first-generation college student, who received Pell Grants throughout my undergraduate career. My mother is a housewife, so the only source of income is from my father, who began his career in the United States as a taxi driver. 

Given our poor financial situation, we often struggled to pay off the rent. Some days, we would need to request financial assistance from our friends and relatives. On other days, my parents had to attend court hearings to avoid eviction. 

During my middle school and high school years, I often struggled to obtain basic school supplies like calculators and notebooks. I would also opt-out of class trips that would require payment.

But surprisingly, I did not see my family's financial struggles as a deterrent to how I approached education. I was a witness to how steadfast my parents were in their commitment to giving me and my brother a proper education. Much of my father’s conscientious character and my mother’s persistence have rubbed off on me. And I utilized these characteristics to persevere through my early educational years, no matter the circumstances.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,3466,300.0,100.0,300.0,1900.0,66.0,1,400,1,2066,01/14/2022,New York University,Chemistry,0,,Yes,Yes,No,"Less than $25,000",4,1,0,0,70.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,13,Adequate,2,2023,3,2.0,0.5,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,"“The ultrasound of your liver shows that it is in the early stages of cirrhosis. If you do not make amendments to your diet, your liver will cease to function.” My patient nods her head up and down, pretending to understand the physician’s words. 

I translate his warning into Bengali. But despite her being the one diagnosed, I was the one who felt the world crashing down. 

Although she received such a life-changing diagnosis, “Ann” still refused to follow my dietary recommendations. As her personal caregiver, I felt inadequate. If I am unable to better the life of a single patient, how can I possibly hope to become a physician and manage hundreds of unique patients at once?    

For the first week following the diagnosis, I felt waves of anxiety as I thought about Ann’s deteriorating condition. Naturally, it would have been easy to blame her. After all, I had tried to convince her and was willing to do anything to make her condition better. But she remained non-compliant. It was tempting to go down that line of thought. But I couldn’t label Ann as the “lazy” patient. 

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I truly was the inadequate one in this aide-patient relationship. But not in the way I initially thought. I was not inadequate in my persistence to better her health. I was inadequate in my approach. The reason why Ann refused to follow my guidelines was that it had no identity. It was a generic plan, crafted for the average patient with late-stage liver damage. It was not a plan crafted for Ann, the elderly lady who loves to consume her traditional Bengali dishes. After a month into my role as her caregiver, I realized that her food preferences were something she had been accustomed to her entire life. Having spent decades eating the same dishes, it would naturally be difficult to suddenly stop. Especially when the advice is coming from someone she barely knew.  

In my new approach, I recommended there be subtle substitutions to her diet. For instance, changing the type of oil used to olive oil. And later on, changing the white rice to brown rice. To my surprise, Ann was much more accepting of this idea. And although the diet was not exactly what I would have preferred, it was something much healthier. 

In the end, what helped Ann was not nutrition science, but someone who understood her and her needs. The power of connecting with patients and using that to give the best possible care was extremely attractive to me. And I wanted to understand how this would manifest in a more formal clinical setting. At the time, my best option was to work as a medical scribe for Dr. Moise. He is a geriatrician who helps run a small clinic in an underserved area of Brooklyn. 

One of my most memorable moments as a scribe was regarding a patient with deteriorating sensory nerves in his hand. During one visit, when the patient began talking, I noticed no new concerns. The exact complaints had been documented the previous week. So there I sat, dumbfounded, while mindlessly typing whatever the patient was saying. But to my surprise, Dr. Moise was unshaken and explained that the patient would not lose the ability to move his hand, but he may lose his sensation in that area. It’s an explanation I heard before, but Dr. Moise did not seem bothered repeating it for the second time.  

After the visit, he disclosed to me that the patient had dementia. And he had been coming to see Dr. Moise for the past few months, multiple times, about the same issue. The patient had no close family members to look after his condition, hence the repeated visits. He then continued to tell me stories about the patient, the initial visit, and his circumstances. I was blown away by the details he conveyed to me. Even as a scribe, I wanted to achieve a similar level of understanding.

So the next time a patient told me their story, I did not dare take them lightly. Each story has major clinical utility by providing a small gateway into someone’s life. And to be a better scribe it was essential for me to utilize those stories during patient visits. Doing so, I was able to view the patient in their entirety and not mindlessly type words, but transcribe with intent. 

The connection that I’ve personally built with Ann, although significant, is but a fraction of what Dr. Moise has been able to accomplish over decades of his practice. How can one person have such a thorough understanding of so many people? This is what leaves me in awe, and pulls me to medicine. I, too, wish to cultivate a community that entrusts its lives in me. And I hope to answer that trust by making every clinical decision an individualized decision, which considers the patient’s unique pathological state as well as the story of how they arrived at that state. As a physician, I do not want to just understand medicine; I want to understand people.","When I completed 4th grade, my parents abruptly decided to leave the U.S. and return to Bangladesh. _x000D_

I transferred to ‚ÄúScholastica,‚Äù an English-medium school where Bangla was ubiquitous. Despite being able to speak Bangla, it was not something I was accustomed to regularly doing.

I am bound to meet people whose views/habits may be different, strange, or unfamiliar. My ability to successfully engage with such diverse individuals will undoubtedly take me far in my future career as a physician.

It was only 7:00AM, and my first call of the day as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).  I approached the nurses’ station and was told to “follow the screaming”. I was dismayed by this response, but I was more appalled by the condition in which I eventually found my patient. I entered the room and found him draped over the side of the bed, with a necrotic left foot and a grubby and soiled bandage that had all but fallen off.  He was screaming in agony over the pain in his left foot, and I immediately rushed over to reposition his body in order to alleviate some of his pain. I then approached the nurses’ station to ask if they could give him some pain medication before the transport, since he was clearly in distress. The nurse responded with “He’s leaving, so it is not my problem”. I was dumbfounded by the response, but kept my head clear as I knew the patient needed my complete focus on his situation. When transferring the patient to the gurney, my partner and I took extra precautions to ensure the patient’s foot was properly accommodated. After arriving at the hospital, we met our patient's son and I felt obligated to explain the condition in which his father was found. I informed him about patient rights, and, as a mandated reporter, highly suggested he find a better facility for his father to stay in. Unfortunately, this trend of subpar healthcare is frequent among the underserved areas of Los Angeles, and witnessing the effects has had a profound impact on how I hope to better my community as a physician. As an EMT, I can only do so much, but if I were a full-fledged physician, I would be able to make a real difference in the lives of those I treat.
A significant part of being an EMT is patient advocacy, as many patients are incapable of advocating for themselves, and can end up getting lost within the healthcare system. Therefore, I have been fortunate to be able to continue nurturing my passion for medicine through serving my community as an EMT. During my time in the field, I have cared for patients of varying acuity. For example, I learned that premature babies require medical air in addition to oxygen and that COVID positive patients generally need additional oxygen as they often de-stat during transport. However, my experiences in the field have also revealed a larger threat to the health of my community; inequality. I have seen how someone’s neighborhood, income, or race can have a greater impact on their health than their pathology. Being an EMT has given me the opportunity to provide patients from all across Los Angeles equal care and attention. Inequality can complicate medicine and the objective role of healthcare providers, and I strive to be a part of the solution, now, and hopefully, as a physician. 
While assisting the Los Angeles Fire Department, many of my patients initially refused transport due to fear or mistrust of the healthcare system. While on scene for a man with a suspected stroke, the patient wanted to deny transport as he feared receiving any diagnosis at the hospital. The man spoke broken English and clearly could be better communicated with if spoken to in Spanish, his native tongue. As the firefighters and my partner only spoke English, it was up to me to interpret. I explained to him, in Spanish, why it was important that he be transported, and why it was urgent that he go, since the medication given for a stroke only works within a short time frame. As an EMT, I strive for all my patients to obtain the care they are entitled to, and that begins with ameliorating medical mistrust. Having a mother who immigrated to Los Angeles from Mexico, and being Latina myself, I can understand the disconnect many patients have with their physician or other medical providers, due to the lack of Latino representation within the healthcare system. I have had countless patients thank me and say how much more comfortable they are, purely because I am speaking their native language. I explained to my patient that I understood his fears, but he required necessary medical attention. Thankfully, he agreed to go to the hospital. Having these significant conversations with my patients has shown me the importance of being transparent, yet firm, all the while incorporating a warm approach in order to keep the patient at ease. I hope to be able to put these skills to good use as a future physician. 
Being able to go to medical school will enable me to succeed in becoming the healthcare professional I have always wanted to be. If given the opportunity to be a physician, I aim to work with underserved communities and minority populations, as I have seen first-hand how affected these groups are by the lack of adequate healthcare available to them. I will strive to make my patients feel seen, heard, and understood, and I vow to provide them with equitable medical treatment and compassion. I have had the opportunity to work in underserved sections of the broader community in which I grew up, and being able to make these modest, but major contributions has reaffirmed my desire to become a physician.","Growing up, I played club basketball, which required traveling every week to attend games all over the county, allowing me to meet and engage with people who had different lived experiences than me. As I explored my extended community, I became more aware of the various social inequities in my hometown of Los Angeles. Over the last two years, I have served these same communities as an EMT and connected with a diverse patient population. I have seen how limited access to adequate food and housing puts patients at elevated risk for anxiety, heart conditions, stroke, and diabetes. In addition, I witnessed the increased morbidity and mortality throughout the pandemic among the underserved and homeless populations. These experiences have inspired me to work with underserved communities as a physician and address social determinants of health in my future practice._x000D_
","While working on the ambulance, I arrived on the scene at my patient‚Äôs home and, during my assessment, realized she only spoke Spanish. I immediately switched languages and re-explained everything I had said up to that point. While en route to the hospital, she reached for my hand and thanked me for speaking in her native language. She explained that her healthcare providers rarely can communicate directly with her and that my ability to do so alleviated much of the anxiety she usually feels during these transports. Throughout my last two years serving in Los Angeles, I have had similar experiences with many of my patients. Underrepresentation in the medical field can create barriers among minority populations, and as a first-generation Mexican-American, I aim to alleviate these barriers. As a physician, I strive to use my voice to advocate for the Latinx community and work to provide patients with culturally and linguistically appropriate care.

Though it was a demanding process, I was able to persevere and am proud to have improved my MCAT score.

I was overweight throughout my early childhood and late adolescence. I felt insecure, disgusted, and hopeless. I was consistently reminded by family, my healthcare provider, and friends of how “fat” and “ugly” I looked. This took a toll on my mental health. I would look at my peers and think, “How can I get skinny like them?” I did not care about having a fantastic physique; I just wanted to feel accepted by my peers. However, I knew being skinny was the only way to be considered. In my eyes, I was nothing. Overall, my confidence was at a record low. I will never forget how my doctor would look at me because it was a combination of anger and concern. In retrospect, I understand why my doctor was frustrated with me because I would not follow her plan. I would only put effort a week before my appointment. 

I was 19 years old when I decided to improve my life. One day, when I looked in the mirror, I realized I was extremely unhappy with my physique. So, I took the initiative to make a drastic change.  I pursued a degree in Biology, so I incorporated the knowledge I obtained to understand how muscles develop fully. I researched and found articles on gaining muscular size and maintaining good heart health. 

Fast forward four years, I am still weightlifting and cycling while still finding ways to improve. I can genuinely say that exercising has been my most outstanding choice. I feel confident, strong, and healthy. My discipline and dedication translated into other parts of my life, such as school, volunteering, and work. I felt compelled to be resourceful, especially for those around me. My father is a disabled veteran diagnosed with various health complications. As his homecare aide, I monitored his health status and taught him how to incorporate and maintain healthy habits. I prepared his meal plans, logged his blood measurements, and walked with him every morning for 3 miles. I noticed his mental and physical health was improving due to the minor adjustments we made together. I was determined to help my father improve his health. I also helped my grandmother start implementing more physical activity in her life because I saw how much it positively changed my father's emotional and mental well-being.

As for myself, I know how it feels to be unable to control one’s eating patterns or understand the benefits of exercise. In addition, I was afraid to visit my healthcare provider because I did not want to be judged by my appearance. Today, I am more aware that people sometimes do not have an effective plan to stay committed because I noticed the healthcare system could lack quality care, weight bias, and stigmas. As a result, I am willing to deliver quality care to my future patients.

My weight loss journey set the path for my willingness to pursue medicine. From the interaction with my doctor to my healthy eating habits, I realized I wanted to help others and bring a more inclusive mindset regarding obesity. Pursuing a medical career would allow me to carry a unique approach to losing weight. I want to provide a holistic approach to improving the lives of my future patients. In addition, I have noticed that people trying to lose weight tend to obsess over results, focus on quick fixes, and deviate from sustainability and health. Essentially, my goal as a healthcare provider is to concentrate on the mental aspects of losing weight because a person’s perspective can impact the execution of the plan. Based on my own experience, I was able to follow the protocol by shifting my attention to internal motives and less on external rewards.

Through my shadowing experience, I was able to shadow an internist named Dr. Uchida. Her days consisted of outpatient clinic, teaching, mentoring, and advising. Her patients tend to be older and have more health complications. Usually, her patients had diabetes or were overweight. I was fascinated by how she was inquisitive and compassionate with her patients. As a result, I desire to learn more about her approach to patient-centered care. I observed and listened to Dr. Uchida focus on screening for diseases and conditions for which obesity is a risk factor. She encouraged her patients to start implementing healthy habits into their daily routines. Her practice reflects my sense of medicine as patient-focused and dependent on a trusted and comprehensive approach.

As I apply to medical school, the one commonality that binds every critical event in my life is how each reflects the importance of patient-focused and compassionate physicians. My goal is to fight against the health risk of obesity with the tenacity and determination that comes from personal experiences. As I look forward to my future as a doctor, I will never forget my roots and always remember the days I wanted to give up on my weight loss journey. I am thrilled to contribute to the future of medicine through my vulnerability, empathy, and honesty. My contribution will allow me to learn about my patients and build a relationship upon trust.","My job has allowed me to understand people from different backgrounds. The people I work with taught me to be sensitive, understanding, and patient because everyone is different. My ability to put myself in another person's shoes has helped me find ways to work in a harmonious environment. Initially, my goal was to complete my job and go home. However, I realize the power of working in a collaborative environment and listening to your coworker's viewpoints. In addition, broadening my worldview has allowed me to have better communication skills and build strong interpersonal relationships. ","Fitness has played a major part in my life because I have developed essential skills, such as discipline, persistence, and consistency. Therefore, these skill sets have transcended my job, academics, and personal life. I have been a strong advocate for implementing healthy habits in my life, such as among my coworkers, family, and neighbors. One of my coworkers struggled with her weight and asked me for advice. We both sat down and discussed ways how she could minimize cravings and be more active. Currently, she is doing very well because she was able to take the initiative and ask for help. On the weekends, we would go for runs, and her stamina has also steadily increased. Her improvements have made me realize that I can influence and impact a person in a positive direction.

As I watched the cardiologist place a stent in the patient's carotid artery, I was astonished at the possibility of giving someone a new life in less than one hour. From that moment, I have continued to ponder the miracle I witnessed, a routine procedure which intimately impacts the lives of people, every day. As a high school student, this experience ignited my desire for a career in medicine.
College increased my fervor for the medical field. As I began taking my first genetics class sophomore year, I simultaneously started volunteering with Best Buddies, a program partnering mentally handicapped students with peers from the general student body. Learning about chromosomal abnormalities in class, I came to understand the real-world implications of these biological intricacies. I felt an intensified calling for a career in medicine as my interest in genetics increased and my relationships with these extraordinary students magnified. I realized how a career in medicine would unite my passion for service and love for learning.
The following semester, I studied abroad in Santiago, immersed in Chilean culture. I utilized my nine years of Spanish education to develop meaningful personal relationships over the next three months. I was convicted by the stories the Chileans shared about how their inadequate medical care led to lost limbs from gangrene or childhood abuse due to parents with undiagnosed mental illness. These experiences served to intensify my zeal for a career devoted to medical advancement. This desire led me to Guatemala, where I helped provide dental services and taught public health to indigenous populations. The gratitude expressed by these isolated communities reminded me once more how a career in medicine presents unique opportunities to serve.
Outside of the classroom, I sought to strengthen my personal characteristics that would further prepare me for a career in medicine. I refined my leadership skills by serving as a Lipscomb Presidential Ambassador, a student government officer, and a Lipscomb admissions tour guide. I experienced the joy of dedicated servant leadership volunteering two summers as a Lipscomb University freshman orientation leader.
Seeking to expand my understanding of the variety of careers in the medical field, I began to volunteer at Vanderbilt Hospital. I was selected to volunteer in Vanderbilt’s Level 1 trauma center, which introduced me to high quality trauma care and exemplary patient management. The patient and provider interactions I witnessed exemplified the importance of intentional physician leadership as well as a compassionate bedside manner.
The enjoyment I experienced volunteering at Vanderbilt led me to apply for, and be awarded, an opportunity to pursue research at Vanderbilt Medical Center. Unfortunately, due to unexpected consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, this unique opportunity was canceled. Refusing to allow the unexpected circumstances brought forth by the pandemic to interfere with my interest in clinical research, I sought alternative avenues of engagement. I secured a position in my genetics professor’s lab, where I investigated the role of neprilysin in triple negative breast cancer. As part of a research team, I gained an appreciation for clinical research. Nurturing cell cultures, analyzing proteins and coordinating with other labs throughout Nashville, my regard for the various treatments available to patients today intensified as I grasped the “behind the scenes” work necessary to produce safe and effective management plans. 
After graduating college, I have strengthened my understanding of healthcare teams, by working as a medical scribe. My understanding of the medical field’s complexity has expanded as I assist in a multitude of ways that extend beyond the transcription of medical charts. Helping medical assistants collect vitals and uploading new information to patient profiles has matured my understanding of each employee’s vital role and shown me the interconnected nature of the clinic's daily operations. As I assist the provider by relaying patient information or new instructions to various team members, I have witnessed how a physician’s duties transcend the exam room, to entail responsibilities including communicating with pharmaceutical companies, submitting insurance requests, and hiring new employees. Discovering how doctors look out for patients not only in the exam room but also as advocates within leadership and administrative roles has solidified my decision to pursue a career in medicine. 
From the onset of college to my current position as a medical scribe, my determination to pursue a career in medicine has only intensified. I am convicted by the endless ways a career in medicine would provide opportunities to enhance the lives of others daily. Through experiences like cleaning crash carts in the ER, providing healthcare to the underserved, and serving as a leader on my college campus, I have prepared for the demands of medical training. I am energized by the thought of a career characterized by limitless learning, and daily opportunities to improve the lives of others.","Studying abroad in Chile, I developed a heightened empathy for people experiencing cultural changes as I adapted to an unfamiliar environment. While in a rural Chilean town, I connected with a local family after their toddler wandered over to my table at a coffee shop. Using my Spanish fluency, we bonded over a mutual passion for climbing, and I was invited to join their climbing trip the next day. I appreciated how our mutual climbing interest brought us together, creating a desire to learn more about the lives of one another. Our cultural differences seemed less like obstacles, but rather a unique benefit of our igniting friendship. After spending the next day on the mountain, I was honored when I was invited to the family‚Äôs home for a traditional dinner, unique to their small community. This friendship demonstrated how relationships with people from diverse backgrounds enables deeper interpersonal understanding and offers deeply enriching experiences.","I have actively pursued creative avenues to support my Dallas community. Volunteering at my local church, I provide childcare during church services, assisting with preschool aged children who only speak Spanish. Working with these young children each week, I find great enjoyment providing reassuring consistency when children are dropped off by their families. Supporting the financial needs of my community, I helped organize a school supplies drive, providing over 900 backpacks for elementary students, and 1400 school supplies kits for grades K-12. Translating for families as they came to pick up their school supplies, I felt a sense of fulfillment seeing the joy on the children‚Äôs faces as they chose their new backpacks or received their school supplies. Working closely with patients from a medically underserved area of Dallas, I connect with Spanish speaking patients as I translate and help alleviate some of the cultural alienation they may be experiencing due to language barriers.",,,1,"A disappointing impact of COVID-19 was the cancellation of my research at Vanderbilt Hospital.

It has been a huge privilege to follow my childhood dreams although they may have initially seemed unachievable due to many reasons. I was born and grew up in a rural part of Ethiopia, where the living conditions are very challenging. Since there were no secondary schools and colleges in the area, I moved to Addis Ababa to pursue my education. I obtained my first Bachelor degree in Pharmacy from Addis Ababa University. During my academic career, I had a chance to get involved in direct interaction with patients and my community during numerous volunteer activities. I have also brought a new positive atmosphere to my birthplace through educating and inspiring the youth, creating a safer community, and improving health conditions by providing lessons for proper nutrition and improved healthcare service. While doing these acts of service, I began to dream of one day becoming a physician, which I knew would allow me to participate in and contribute to the improvement of healthcare especially those in underserved areas like my community.
 
My interest to join medical school was elevated when I was a fourth-year student at Addis Ababa University. By that time, I was excited to apply to an accelerated medical program designed by the Ethiopian government to train pharmacists and nurses as physicians to overcome a country wide shortage of medical doctors. Unfortunately, my mother became ill, and I was not able to attend. Moreover, my parents wanted me to finish school as quickly as possible so that I could support my family financially after graduation. Because of this, I chose to begin working as a pharmacist immediately upon graduation. Despite growing my career in pharmacy, my interest and motivation in studying medicine did not go away. 
After I moved to the United States, I reflected and recalibrated on my goals and motivation to follow my dream. I focused again on the pursuit of my dream to become a physician, which my application demonstrates in taking immediate action to pursue this career pathway. As evidence for these immediate actions, I have completed a second bachelor’s of science in biology from George Mason University. In addition, I have also completed the premedical graduate-level program at Virginia Commonwealth University to enhance my qualifications for admission into medical school.

In tandem with significant efforts to expand my studies and prepare for the academic rigor of medical school, I have also grown professionally in the fast-paced, high acuity environment of an intensive care unit (ICU) through working as clinical technician in Inova Alexandria Hospital. I have always been fascinated by the way a care team can tailor a specific treatment plan for each patient. Most importantly, I enjoyed listening to and understanding how healthcare professionals discuss the condition of a patient based on their scientific knowledge of the physiological systems of human beings. I always want to have that level of knowledge so that I could use it as a base for improving the health of my patients. Moreover, I have seen and admired the multidisciplinary nature of the practice of medicine, and being a part of this team has been a blessing.

Although working in the ICU was challenging in itself, the first six months of 2020 have been particularly difficult to manage because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our unit and hospital had a surplus of patients that were critically ill and more unstable than even our high acuity unit has ever seen. It was difficult to follow the regular routine and do all the patient care activities due to so many changes in the procedures for treating COVID-19 patients. I worked night shifts while attending school full time. During the surge of the pandemic, there was a shortage of both staff and PPE, so I worked extra shifts even with my tight schedule to support my team and patients. It was a great honor to be a part of a team that ensured all patients received the care needed even during times of a crisis.

I believe that medicine is the most challenging and rewarding career in existence. I am also convinced that the challenges I will face are nothing compared to the rewards I will get back for helping to make a patient well again. I always want to challenge myself and increase my knowledge, so that I can become a competent professional. I cannot think of any other career outside of healthcare that I would rather be a part of or be more committed to. It is difficult for me to answer the question of why I selected the field of healthcare because for me it is like asking why you need water or air to live!

Healthcare helps to sustain and improve life around the world, and medicine is the central part of this service. Inevitably, I will face many challenges while pursuing my career in medicine, but I believe it will strengthen my character and make me an even better physician. Thanks to the opportunities here in the U.S., I am certain in my vocation to be a physician.","My experience in the topics of diversity is not small, I have great deal of experience in working with a very diversified team. As a start, I will share my experience about respect for others. I believe that acknowledging other‚Äôs culture, race, gender, social background, etc. is the mainstream to enjoy diversity. I will try to focus on developing creating awareness in the topic of unity and diversity. Our journey to become a physician starts from here, because eventually in one way or another we will end up with treating a patient from different background from us. So, no matter what race or culture that patient is, we will be responsible for giving service to the patient. In my opinion, we do not even have to go this far when it comes to diversity. If we love and care one another, we will forget the act of discrimination and stigmatization in the first place. Everyone should thrive to build this mind set and act accordingly. ","My previous clinical experiences show my commitments to improve the quality of life of my community. I have started working as a volunteer since I was a high school student at Mother Teresa health centers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In addition, I have served as a pharmacist for five years at community pharmacy in Ethiopia that serves low-income people. Throughout my life I am inclined to focus on community-centered medicine and improving the health and quality of life of any community. I will achieve and strengthen the positive attributes of a great physician through my RMC experience. After I graduate, I want to advocate for improvements in healthcare systems and community health particularly in underserved communities. When I say serving, it is not just helping them the way they are getting the service right now. I want to go further when it comes to community centered service and direct patient care.  I want to make changes. One of the areas may be focusing on prevention strategies.",,,1,"I was working full time at Inova Alexandria Hospital and going full time school during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Second, the lock down had a great negative impact particularly during my preparation for the MCAT Test. I usually prefer to study at the library because I do not have convenient place at home. All the libraries and all cafes were closed, so I tried to study at home even though it was not my preference. In my first attempt, I was working fulltime, going full time school, and studying for the MCAT. Since my scores were low, I have decided to aggressively work on my education career.

2023,15127909,,26,Woman,USA,1,EO1,0,1,"I don’t remember a time that my family was financially comfortable. Although they tried to hide it by making sure my siblings and I had everything we needed, it was quite obvious to me growing up. We were on Food Stamps and Medicaid up until 4 years ago. We were renting and had to move every 2 to 3 years. The longest I was ever enrolled in a school was at Drexel. My parents did buy a home when I was 7 years old.  However, 3 years later, they ran into more financial troubles which resulted in them filing for bankruptcy. After 2 years of owning a home, they returned to renting. About 5 years ago, my dad left his job at a gas station and bean working as a telemetry technician. The pay raise was much needed but it also led to an increase in our spending since we no longer qualified for government assistant. So even though our paychecks were larger, we were spending just as much if not more due to additional expenses. With the help of family, my parents were able to buy their home 2 years ago. Although we still live paycheck to paycheck, we are no longer classified as being disadvantaged due to low income. To me, not much has changed.

I always knew I wanted a career in medicine, even if I didn’t fully understand what it meant. Growing up, my curiosity in science, teaching, and community service began to take shape when I was in middle school. I was participating in community clean-ups and mentoring programs, while striving to get into the upper-level biology courses. Realizing that I could combine these passions in the field of medicine, I pursued opportunities that would pave the way while allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of medicine. With each one of these experiences, particularly my time as a Biospecimen Collection Assistant and Patient Care Assistant, my knowledge of the field grew, as did my desire and motivation to become a physician. 

For my first co-op at Drexel University, my primary responsibility as a Biospecimen Collection Assistant was identifying individuals about to receive spinal anesthesia and explaining Penn’s BioBank to them in hopes they would donate their cerebral spinal fluid for future research studies. The patients I interacted with were primarily minority patients from underserved communities in Philadelphia. When speaking with them, I often found them to be confused and scared by terminology such as “cerebral spinal fluid” which led them to decline participation. These individuals were already terrified because they were undergoing serious procedures such as hip replacements, and there I was adding another layer of uncertainty to their experience. Overtime, through observing the interactions between physicians and patients, I began to add more lay words and spend more time explaining the entirety of the process to patients. With this slight change in my manors, I was able to build a stronger foundation with my patients which led to an increase in rates of consent. Even though I was responsible for gaining patient consent for a research study, this population of patients may feel the same hesitance when presented with treatments and diagnoses that are unfamiliar to them. This experience broadened my perspective and showed me that the underserved population requires additional guidance in the medical field in order to receive proper treatment.

After graduating with my undergraduate degree, I began working as a Patient Care Assistant. As my current position, it continues to exemplify my passion for medicine and caring for patients. Although I was interacting with patients during my co-op, this time I am providing direct patient care. I take vital signs, do bloodwork and EKGs, help with hygiene care, and everything in between. Every patient, although presenting with COVID, has a different background and treatment plan. The connections with patients and physicians are much more concrete as I see the same people for days and sometimes weeks at a time. The length of their stay gives me the ability to truly learn about each individual patient. The motivation to do this has always been present, but was enhanced greatly after my experience with Mr. A. 

I walked into Mr. A’s room and immediately noticed the layer of sweat building up on his body and the empty, yet still panicked, look in his eyes. Just the night before he had been telling me about his time in Vietnam as I watched him walk to the bathroom, but now it took three of us to change his soiled sheets while he lay there unable to move. Not long after, his rapid decline led us to transfer him to the ICU. On the way to the ICU, the physician was finally able to get in touch with his family and they made the difficult decision to change his status to comfort care. The unexpected nature of his death shocked his family and healthcare team. During his decline, I examined every bit of his chart and walked around with a multitude of questions to determine what went wrong. What was the reasoning behind every treatment the physicians had given him? Why didn’t they seem to work? Why he did he go from a healthy man to dead within two days? The physicians and nurses tried their best to answer my questions, but some were unanswerable. Although not all my questions were answered, my desire to pursue their answers strengthened and I began the habit of researching diseases and comorbidities of my patients and their treatments to make myself more knowledgeable in their care. 

When first deciding to go into medicine, I thought that my role would involve assessing a multitude of symptoms and solving the puzzle to properly diagnose a patient. I know now that it was a naïve way to think. Working in a hospital has taught me that the role of the physician extends beyond simply diagnosing, and that this career requires the ability to be flexible and cater your behavior to your patient’s needs. It also requires physicians to be able to guide their patients through difficult decisions using knowledge accumulated through previous learning and experience. Physicians are lifelong learners of science and lifelong teachers for their patients. As a physician, I can use my desire to be both while having a positive impact on a patient’s life.","At Beat the Streets, I mentored Philadelphia high school wrestlers ‚Äì a group of primarily Black and Hispanic males. While spending time with the children, I learned more about their lives. We explored differences and similarities in our religions. Not only did I learn about the differences between our cultures, but I also heard countless stories about things that no child should have to face. Even though they faced so much negativity in the world, they saw Beat the Streets as a safe haven. They came to the center to increase their chances of a receiving an education. _x000D_
_x000D_
The children left a lasting impact on the way I would like to practice medicine in the future. As a physician, it is important to be mindful of cultural differences within different populations. Being aware of these differences will allow physicians to treat a whole-person specific to their needs. I hope to take everything those children have taught me and continue to make a safe haven for my patients. ","As a Patient Care Assistant, I interact with numerous patients during each shift. Some are only in the hospital for observation for one or two nights, however, we have some patients who are admitted for weeks at a time. Caring for these patients makes me feel as though I have left a positive impact on them, and therefore the community. _x000D_
_x000D_
There is no better feeling than when a patients eyes light up when giving a someone who hasn‚Äôt brushed their hair in two days a comb or successfully getting bloodwork done on an individual who is a hard stick. That is when all the losses one faces in healthcare diminish momentarily because you feel like you did something good by making a patient feel more comfortable and cared for. Indirectly, caring for these patients also impacts the community. Each and every one of my patients is an active member of the community prior to their admission and caring for them allows them to return to the community and continue on with their role.",,,1,"Right before finals week of my junior year, the entire city shut down. My last co-op was postponed and my job in the city was closed. Every one of my shadowing and volunteering opportunities that I had lined up were cancelled. After the end of my co-op, I shortly moved back to Philadelphia. My time in Philadelphia from September 2020 to December 2020 was not easy. Classes were online and my volunteering activities were cancelled or online. My retail job had opened with minimized staffing; I was not making enough to pay rent. I decided to break my lease to move home. Many times I had one of my parents walk into my room during an exam or had a sibling ask me a question while I was presenting material. All unexpected situations that would not have been present in a physical classroom. I tried my hardest to ensure my grades did not suffer.

HR: 16 bpm. Grace’s vitals hovered weakly at this level. Then, her heart stopped. The doctor in the ER called for asynchronous CPR. I turned to the paramedic in charge of my ride-along for permission—and some sort of reassurance—then suddenly found myself standing on a stool beside the patient. The respiratory therapist gave his orders: “Deep compressions at a quick pace.” Instinctively, my hands assumed the CPR position and began pushing. With two other nurses, we performed two cycles of asynchronous CPR. After twelve minutes, the physician halted the rotation and ceased all treatment; Grace’s sister requested to stop all life saving measures. A time of death was called. 
This was not my first encounter with death. I had the privilege of spending time with my great-grandmother; every Sunday, she would take my brother and I to the market and share tteok—rice cakes—and regale us with stories of her childhood in rural Korea. But during one of our last visits, I saw her labored breaths and agonized expression. Even at age six, I knew something was wrong, but felt powerless; in that moment, I wanted to become someone I thought would be able to help her—a doctor.

My experience with Grace reminded me of my great-grandmother and why I originally wanted to become a physician. I also realized there was more to learn. I shadowed ER physicians and surgeons who imparted the importance of adapting to situations and providing personalized care. Additionally, wanting to have a more tangible understanding of how doctors could also advance the field of medicine via research and following my interest in neuroscience, I found an opportunity to gain firsthand insight at CHLA. Segmenting pediatric brain scans at diagnosis, after surgery, and during recovery, all highlighted the healing process and the profound impact medicine is capable of. 
Eventually, my curiosity extended beyond the lab—I wished to experience patient interaction and the human element of medicine. Emergency medicine piqued my interest and after obtaining my EMT certification, I chose to work at an ambulance company focused on assisting the underserved communities of Los Angeles. Call after call, the somber realities of the American healthcare system began to reveal themselves, especially in the most vulnerable communities. Hours-long wait times for available beds and physicians along with ineffective interactions caused by economic, cultural, linguistic, and social barriers were calls I encountered too often. However I viewed these calls as opportunities to not only exercise and build my understanding of medicine, but also extend care and compassion to the community. The long waits were shortened by engaging in conversations with patients and as our interactions became friendlier, they became more comfortable discussing their concerns—medical and personal—which I did my best to address. 
From these conversations in the ambulance, hospital hallways, and psychiatric facilities, I learned nearly a third of my patients were homeless and/or suffering from addiction. Thus during the pandemic, I started as a coordinator at a women’s homeless shelter and a healthcare technician at a rehabilitation facility to further explore the issues plaguing these communities. In both settings I formed connections with the residents, learning their stories of survival and encouraging their recovery. 
It wasn’t uncommon for residents to act aggressively and I quickly had to learn to  de-escalate situations and introduce healthier coping mechanisms. I realized the hostility was typically a defense mechanism developed by patients as a result of their pasts. Together with the clinical team, we focused on helping the clients overcome their trauma rather than simply treating the symptoms.
A portion of my twelve hour shifts was spent besides clients, simply listening to their fascinating or heart-wrenching stories. Recounting their histories not only helped the clients start deconstructing their trauma, but also built rapport between us. Much like my EMT patients, clients often began feeling comfortable enough to discuss more private, meaningful concerns—accelerating their recovery. Through active listening, I was able to befriend the facility’s clients; hearing former clients express that they’ve finally “broken generations of addiction” and “can live a life my kids would be proud of” is an experience more fulfilling than I can put in words.
During my great-grandmother’s final days, I thought a doctor would be able to help by bringing back her health. For years, I believed doctors treated a patient. Now, I’ve realized the physician’s potential extends beyond the individual and continues to benefit the greater community as well. From breaking cycles of trauma and addiction, to combating illnesses, to researching better treatments, a physician’s care and insight can influence society for the better. Many patient interactions helped me see that medicine is more than just treating the signs and symptoms and requires acknowledging each patient holistically. While my clinical experiences have yielded me my own special philosophy and set of skills, I believe medical school is the avenue towards enhancing my knowledge so that I too, may help communities thrive in the future.","I‚Äôve worked with diverse patient populations from various underserved communities - the homeless, formerly incarcerated, abused, and victims of trafficking - in Los Angeles and from a number of Southern states, providing medical care and offering social resources. _x000D_

At South Coast, our clients vary in every sense of the word: racially, religiously, socially, financially, etc. I perform weekly ‚Äúcheck-ins‚Äù where I assess a client‚Äôs health and build rapport with the clients.

By understanding and incorporating each client‚Äôs personal story, I‚Äôm more capable of creating a higher quality treatment plan.  _x000D_

Each shift, I made an effort to get to know each client better and with each interaction, I began to see how health disparities - like the lack of access to healthcare, higher rates of untreated medical conditions, etc - negatively affected underserved communities.

Friends and family were constantly talking about how the springs in my feet contained enough energy to fuel a busy city. My earliest memories are full of self-made experiments aiming to resolve the curiosity I had about my physical abilities and limits. Once I had a trampoline, these experiments often ended in a pulled muscle, broken bone, or lecture from my mom. However, each attempt led to more questions than answers, so I would inevitably be back on my trampoline planning and executing my next experiment and the cycle would repeat. By the end of the summer, my mother had no choice but to enroll me in gymnastics classes so I could explore my curiosities in a safer way. Immediately, I became devoted to the sport and dreamed of becoming a college gymnast, like my coach Kellie. Injuries are present and inevitable in most sports, so it came to no surprise when the occasional strained muscle or fractured bone would slow or stop the progress of my training. However, through this, I unexpectedly uncovered a deep and persistent curiosity about the human body, its abilities, and the mechanisms it employs.

By the age of 12, I had an early release from school to practice gymnastics 25 hours each week. I considered my coach and teammates to be my closest friends and, like most kids that play a sport, was convinced of my future as an Olympic gold medalist. I dedicated countless hours to perfect a skill that would give my balance beam routine the highest base score to be competed by any Utah gymnast prior to going elite, the back salto dismount. But one week before competition day, I made one wrong move which resulted in a painfully life changing fracture in my lower back. I will never forget when my doctor calmly advised me to quit the sport to prevent permanent back pain. My young mind quite literally thought the world was ending. Little did I know, my world was changing all around me and holding onto this support system, my team, would be vital for my mental health. 

I continued attending practice, as injured members of the team always did, but often asked myself what I was doing since rejoining my team wasn’t a long term possibility. Later that summer, my mother explained the financial trouble we were in and let me know she was selling our house and using the money to move to Hawaii, and I would be moving in with my father and step-mother. A week later, I found out my step-mother was pregnant. A month later, my mom boarded her flight with my two dogs and I wouldn't see them for another year. Now, at 13, I had an abundance of emotions with no clue what to do with them. Relying on my team and coach was all I could think to do until the new year hit with the devastating news that our coach, my lifelong role model, Kellie, had died over the break due to an undiagnosed heart condition.

Just as I was starting to feel optimistic about my new normal and recovery from my injury, mourning the unexpected death of my 27-year-old role model left me feeling helpless and hopeless. The hardships I had experienced up to this point were often overcome with the assistance of Kellie’s optimism and wise words of advice. Without her comfort, I was left feeling scared and lonely. Only after she was gone did I fully appreciate how influential she had been in my life. The support provided by my teammates and the hours I spent with my new therapist allowed me to cope with and ultimately overcome these challenges. I emerged from these hardships and adversities as a happier and stronger version of myself. I promised to not only carry, but implement the values Kellie had taught me for the rest of my life. 

My experiences working through and recovering from hardships in life have encouraged my scientific curiosities and amplified my determination to continually advance my emotional and intellectual capacities. As much as these various hardships and people have taught me, they have also allowed me to offer a helping hand. These experiences are what constantly drive me to enhance my competency to become an active member of society. The opportunity to be an influential part of someone’s journey to a long healthy life makes this dream of mine so rewarding. While exploring my fascination with the human body and strengthening my compassion and empathy through each experience, I strive to grow by continually implementing my passion into medical school and then within the workplace. The springs in my feet contain enough energy to fuel my desire to use my passion to help others and be an impactful member of society.","As a Hispanic woman who grew up in a predominantly caucasian community, I admittedly had insecurities about my heritage and culture. As my school classes grew larger and more diverse I learned to appreciate the uniqueness of the individual and continue to expose myself to the diverse cultures that surround me. While on the road to medical school, I have been encouraged by the engagement the program at Rush Medical College has with surrounding communities and want to be a part of the culture you promote. I have watched family members avoid preventative care due to a language barrier with their doctors and want to learn from a program that works toward dismantling disparities in healthcare. I will contribute to the communities you serve because I have always had a personal drive to encourage and embrace other cultures and will always aim to lift others while being able to learn from their experiences.  ","Medicine is altruistic in theory but the way it‚Äôs practiced is what shapes medicine into what it is today and what it can become. In a world of change, medicine has proven to be resilient.

At the age of 15, my mom began to experience rapid weight loss just as we were selling the childhood home we could no longer afford.

I cycled through some breaths of the mist, and, within minutes, a wave of relief spread throughout my body; I could finally breathe. I often visited the ED or my pediatrician, Dr. O, when I experienced an asthma flare-up. Appointments with Dr. O felt like I was visiting my auntie: the endearing and compassionate tone of her voice, the exchange of Tagalog between her and my mother. Dr. O's management of my care sparked my interest in a career in medicine.

My ambition of joining the field of medicine matured when I began working as a physical therapy aide. With a background in physiology, I was excited to address musculoskeletal dysfunction. I soon realized a major gap in my knowledge: the human aspect of caring for patients in a clinic. My job in Mr. B's case was to guide him through prescribed knee exercises during his pre-surgical and post-surgical therapy sessions. Mr. B shared that he was determined to walk without a limp. Mr. B, his physical therapist, and I made a therapeutic goal that Mr. B would bend his knee more each time he got onto the stationary bike.

Mr. B's recovery was more convoluted than I had expected. There were occasional setbacks during his rehabilitation that brought him to tears. I could not understand what he was enduring, but I knew I had to comfort him, just like Dr. O comforted me whenever I was ill. I handed him a towel to wipe his eyes and reminded him how far he had progressed since starting therapy. After a few months, Mr. B exclaimed, ""Justin! Come look at this!"" He was able to bend his knee to complete a full rotation on the stationary bike. At that moment, I felt gratitude for being able to accompany Mr. B on his journey. His rehabilitation underscored that the people I am working with are more than a dysfunction or case study. Mr. B reminded me of the human aspect that cannot be forgotten in medicine.

Volunteering in a bustling ED showed me the diversity of patient presentations and further enticed me to enter the medical field. During a shift in the ED, the doors burst open, and paramedics brought in a patient while they were performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. With my adrenaline pumping, I gathered supplies and became part of the life-saving efforts. I was humbled to contribute in any way and was in awe of the code team working diligently for the welfare of this patient. My eagerness turned to sorrow when the patient was pronounced dead.

This patient's death was not the result I expected. I was so fixated on the positive outcomes and the praise the care team receives for saving a life that I had forgotten about the unfortunate side of medicine. I know this experience paints a realistic picture of what I should expect as a physician. But rather than be deterred, I am inspired by the compassionate and selfless individuals who worked together to try to revive this patient.

My understanding of how medicine extends beyond the clinic further developed as I volunteered with a clean syringe exchange program. The program provides harm reduction materials and other supplies for people experiencing substance use disorder and homelessness. I engaged with a client who wanted access to emergency opioid overdose treatments and sterile needles. He expressed he was not ready to break his habit, but wanted education about medication-assisted treatment. I sensed his reluctance to speak with me, so I made sure to give him my undivided attention. I provided the education and resources available to him and acknowledged his effort in pursuing these services. He thanked me for this information and appreciated how I did not treat him how others do, like ""street scum.""

Speaking with this client helped me understand the power of creating a safe environment to facilitate conversations about receiving care. The client felt safe to be vulnerable and empowered to ask for support. Because I did not judge this patient, he felt validated and heard. He might not be at a place in his journey to quit, but the care this program provides equips him with the resource should he become ready to take the next step. This opportunity helped me recognize that everyone has their own background that we need to be mindful and respectful of. It is important to meet people wherever they are in life and to remind them that we will be there to support them on their path.

Physicians function in a unique space where science and humanism intersect. My interaction with Dr. O and interest in life sciences drew me to a career as a physician, but work and volunteer opportunities helped me refine my passion. My experiences demonstrated that managing a patient's care is complex and will not always yield positive outcomes. I learned to be mindful of other people's backgrounds and not be quick to judge. I realized my true motivations for becoming a doctor are to provide compassionate care, facilitate human connection, and empower others through medicine. I am excited to cultivate my passions as I progress through medical school, into a long and worthwhile career.","Interacting with the members of a syringe exchange program has taught me to embrace diversity and use people-first language. Participants of the program are people who are experiencing housing insecurity, substance use disorders, or are engaged in sex work. Society has taught us to associate drug use and sex work negatively, which makes these participants vulnerable and shamed for their activities. The program reminded me how to extend compassion, especially to the people that society rejects. Participants are not defined by their practices and deserve the same respect we give others. Using negative labels such as drug abusers validates the stigma and pushes people away. The staff come from diverse backgrounds and create a welcoming atmosphere to facilitate a community partnership. Through this partnership, we empower and improve the participants' health. The program inspires me to unlearn the stigma and be conscious of my word choice, so that people I converse with feel included.","Volunteering with San Diego Refugee Tutoring challenged me to build enthusiasm in students who were not engaged in sessions. The program sends kids home when they are not participating, which is detrimental since many of the kids are behind academically. My student, M, came to sessions for social interactions and was dismissed often. While working with M, I discovered his academic struggles fueled his frustration. He was placed in seventh grade, despite his academic ability being below that level._x000D_
Being mindful of M‚Äôs negative association with school, I sought to develop rapport to build his enthusiasm. I began our sessions with our handshake and a general check-in on how he was doing in school. I learned about his various interests, such as soccer, wrestling, and music. To keep M engaged, I integrated his interests into math problems and selected reading material he actually enjoyed. My bond with M blossomed into a friendship, making it easier for him to attend tutoring regularly.",,,1,,1,0,2

As a volunteer at MANNA, a Philadelphia-based hunger relief initiative, I prepared medically tailored meals for those with chronic illnesses who were unable to afford a healthy diet. Reflecting upon my service work along with my academic and extracurricular experiences, I have learned that compassionate treatment arises at the intersection of medical assessment and socioeconomic awareness. This perspective has led me to pursue a career in medicine because I will have the privilege of developing therapeutic regimens that extend beyond the clinical setting and take into account social and economic factors that are imperative to well-rounded medical care.

One particular patron I worked with at MANNA dropped by frequently to express his gratitude and ask for recipes to recreate at home. Over time, I learned that he was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and had recently started receiving dialysis. Although he had access to healthcare through Pennsylvania’s Medical Assistance (MA) program, he could not financially sustain the complex dietary requirements that were part of his physician’s proposed treatment plan. After a few months of receiving nutritional counseling in addition to meals that were low in sodium and phosphorus, he showed improvement in his bloodwork and was living an overall healthier life. Being part of this patron’s journey, I gained insight into the complex relationship that exists between one’s well-being and various determinants of health. This experience has driven my objective to attend medical school where I will have the opportunity to broaden my understanding of the effects of food insecurity on health outcomes and build the necessary clinical reasoning skills to make a larger impact on a patient’s health.

An important component of medicine is the ability to integrate theory and experiment in order to address complex issues in healthcare that impede the provision of quality health care. Through my academic research and coursework, I was able to explore this concept and develop related skills. As a research assistant, I pursued a passion for molecular biology sparked by Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology II, a course taught by my research advisor. By formulating a hypothesis based on specific intracellular protein rearrangements, a topic introduced in this course, I designed successful experiments which helped to explain certain overarching processes that occur in cancer metastasis. While I gained an appreciation for the pathology of disease through my research project, I realized that medicine encompasses more than clinical treatment and that one’s health is influenced by a wide array of factors. Later in my undergraduate career, I expanded my knowledge of the detrimental effects of lower socioeconomic status on health during the core elective course: Interprofessional Healthcare in Underserved Communities. Combined with my experiences at MANNA, I utilized literature presented in class on health disparities to develop strategies to combat and prevent food deserts and, subsequently, encourage healthier lifestyles in underserved populations.

Inspired by my service with MANNA and wanting to explore my interest in the field of medicine, I began to volunteer on the labor and delivery floor at Penn Medicine (HUP) where I assisted physicians and nurses in providing medical care to a predominantly marginalized, urban patient population. During one of my volunteer shifts, I worked with a mother whose newborn was placed in the NICU due to postpartum complications. Like many other new parents I encountered, she was uncertain of her ability to foster a strong foundation for her child due to the social pressures and financial strain she faced in her daily life. As I checked in with her throughout the afternoon, I comforted her by empathizing and listening to her concern for her child’s welfare. I also found that despite not being able to ensure an ideal environment to raise newborn infants, many physicians supported new families emotionally and gave them information on social resource centers and ample supplies in hopes of making a difference. 

My volunteer and academic experiences have led me to recognize the importance of being empathetic towards each patient’s unique circumstances when providing treatment since health extends beyond the hospital. I have also learned that with every effort to fully rehabilitate the patient, there should be an equal emphasis placed on providing comfort along the way; each step to restoring a patient's health is an opportunity to provide support and solace. Attending medical school will provide me with invaluable opportunities to realize my goals and empower me with the crucial skills necessary to practice clinical medicine and ameliorate access to quality healthcare for underserved communities.","The summer of my sophomore year, I traveled to the city of Visakhapatnam in southeastern India to visit my ancestral home. Upon arrival, I helped my ammamma (grandmother) prepare a variety of homemade sweets for the religious festival of Vinayaka Chavithi to distribute amongst family members. Accompanying my ammamma as she visited relatives, however, I quickly felt out of place. While others chatted about upcoming social events or local political elections, I could neither add to discussions nor articulate myself well enough to engage in conversations. _x000D_

To better connect with my extended family, I worked to improve my oral Telugu with impromptu lessons from my ammamma. As I gained confidence in my communication skills, I developed a better appreciation for my cultural heritage. Speaking to my relatives about their lifestyles and values and sharing my own, I recognized the importance of actively working to understand the diverse sociocultural experiences of others.","An initiative I have led as a pharmacy technician focuses on improving hypertension medication adherence in high-risk patient populations. A particular patient I spoke with was concerned with his inability to consistently pick up his blood pressure medication. After assuring the patient that I would work with him to address the issue, I described different approaches to improving his adherence including mail services and new prescription requests. By supplying medication guides and requesting a pharmacist to clarify the patient‚Äôs questions, I helped provide the patient with the necessary information to make a well-informed decision. Based on the patient‚Äôs choice, I contacted his physician for a ninety-day supply prescription change to accommodate the patient‚Äôs situation. Understanding that others may be facing similar circumstances, I advocated for supplying all high-risk patients with complimentary pill boxes and informational handouts on the importance of medication adherence.",,,1,,1,0,3

I knew right away that she needed help, and I went over to sit next to her. I asked if she wanted to see what I’d brought from home, and as I pulled  my favorite stuffed cat out of my backpack, her tears stopped. I have always had an intrinsic drive to help  others, which has grown into my motivation to pursue  medicine. If we recognize and care that something is amiss and take some small action to fix it, we have an opportunity to make the world a better place. I saw this proved as I grew up: helping a friend who failed a Latin test drill words until she laughingly said she could hear them in her sleep, or helping a quiet coworker plan how to meet an exuberant officemate halfway. If one can naturally take a small action on a playground, that could be cultivated into an ability to make change on a greater scale. From my experiences, I know I want to use the skills I’ve cultivated to make change as a physician.

Over my ten years in libraries, I worked with patrons daily to understand their spoken or unspoken needs. While I received satisfaction from this, it didn’t feel like an endpoint for my abilities. One day a firefighter fundraiser accidentally  recruited me into volunteering and as an EMT I discovered a new purpose for my library skills and innate drive to help others: they were a natural complement to hands-on patient care. If the human body’s needs could be identified, it was fixable . EMS added a new dimension: recognizing and correcting the “need” happened on multiple levels at once. I had a frightened patient with an arm fracture at a softball game on an ominously cloudy day: we had to earn his trust before he’d let us examine and splint his arm. He gave a relieved sigh as the analgesics began to work, and we loaded him into the ambulance just as the rain started. I found pride in being part of this team, able to walk into an unpredictable situation and bring solutions. As we left the hospital after transferring our patient, I turned  to my paramedic and asked what came next and what the physician would do for the patient. I loved being an EMT, and always wanted to know more. This was the spark to leave librarianship and become a full-time firefighter/EMT : I wanted to explore medicine more fully.

A year later, my paramedic work partner urged me to consider becoming a paramedic; I jumped at the chance to take greater responsibility in my patients’ care. In the classroom it felt like I was on the right track rising to the challenge; we had a joke that we could do any of our skills in any situation and I once demonstrated a skill station upside down. At the same time, I found myself asking my instructors, some of them physicians, about differences with in-hospital applications: the answers I received brought on more questions, and I realized paramedic might be a step, not the endpoint: I loved medicine and being a paramedic but kept wondering what I might be able to do as a physician.

One afternoon my crew was dispatched for a bicyclist vs automobile accident. We arrived on scene to find the bystander kneeling by our bicyclist patient was our command physician. He reviewed our charts and trained us, but this was the first time I’d seen him in field. He stood off to the side to give room for my crew to work, but as command gave us orders on the spot rather than us needing to radio for them. He then rode with us to the hospital, and in the trauma bay he gave the turnover report himself. I listened, rapt: this was the report I had been striving to give each time I arrived at the hospital. I understood at that moment that while I loved the excitement and challenge of being a paramedic, being a physician would bring the knowledge and resolution in patient encounters for which I was searching.

As I realized this, I questioned if I would be able to give up the adrenaline of paramedic life. To explore a side of medicine I hadn’t been exposed to, I worked as a medical assistant in a primary care clinic, meeting the same patients repeatedly. In the clinic, I assisted with a Lifestyle Medicine course, where participants were coached on small changes to help address chronic medical concerns. I remember walking back into the room of a patient I’d seen several times, both of us smiling as I told him that his A1c was now in the target range. I saw that I had a similar joy to the physician I worked with in building these meaningful relationships with patients. She was the facilitator that helped patients achieve their long-term successes: while different from the excitement of being a paramedic, this was what I wanted to bring to people.

In EMS I discovered a focus for the desire to help others that I’d had all my life. As I brought patients into the ER and shadowed in hospitals and clinics, I learned more and more the impact physicians make  on their patients’ lives. I have seen that there are many small things that can be done to improve the world on a daily basis, and found fulfilment in serving those around me as I’ve developed my medical skills. I seek to further my education and experiences in medicine to better accomplish this: I would love to create change in the world as a physician.","My education in other countries taught me not to expect to share a fluent language with others.

Supporting one another as we embrace our differences allows us to benefit from one another's strengths.

This is something I was reminded of after an incredibly despairing experience - when I broke my pinky toe. Surprisingly, the most painful part of the experience was not the broken bone, but instead, the emotional suffering that the injury imposed on me. Once I was put on crutches, I immediately felt that I had lost my independence, a trait that I deem highly about myself because it reinforces my ability to be self-sufficient. Undoubtedly, my injury prevented me from accomplishing normal activities, such as walking or taking a shower with both legs inside the bathtub. However, I was stunned when I could not perform actions that are secondhand nature for most individuals, such as getting dressed. While I was extremely flattered by the selfless nature of others by helping me accomplish these meager acts, I wanted to prove, primarily to myself, that I could still function normally despite my disability. Sadly, I quickly learned this fantasy was not feasible. Being disabled made me feel as though I was a mere spectacle due to the immense amount of unwanted attention I received. Typically, I always manage to find a positive aspect in any predicament, but this incident tested my buoyant nature; although, I will admit that crutching around a 2,500-acre campus is a great abdominal workout! Ultimately, I was repeatedly questioning the purpose of this accident. However, as time passed, I began seeing the artistry of this experience because it allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how patients feel when they are admitted into medical care. The thoughts and feelings of a patient can be watered down and lost amongst the colossal world of medicine because while patients want to be cared for, they do not want to feel on display. Breaking a minuscule bone allowed me to understand the profound impact physicians have when feeling helpless and vulnerable because by physicians exuding empathy and respect, they aid in the ability to regain autonomy, an incredibly valuable quality that can easily be overlooked. 

While I have experienced physical trauma, I have also been on the side of adversity that led to comprehending how emotional agony affects daily functioning. At the end of my first year at Virginia Tech, I experienced the death of my best friend and former swimming teammate. This was my first confrontation with the gruesome topic of death and, therefore, I was bewildered about how to properly handle it. Consequently, the addition of this hardship on top of challenging coursework led me to struggle to succeed in classes. However, as time continued, I learned how to masterfully balance health and academics. As my health flourished, I developed exceptional study habits such as attending office hours, studying daily, and proactively reading forthcoming lectures. These habits enabled me to improve my GPA and thrive as a scholar. Therefore, regardless of any challenge I face, I am confident that I will persevere by implementing an optimistic mindset to focus on the purpose behind each adversity and progress towards accomplishing my goals. 

Although my desire to pursue medicine developed within academic settings, my commitment to becoming a humane and exceptional physician was ignited while shadowing a primary care physician. On my first day, an elderly male patient stumbled into his appointment complaining of excruciating back pain. I saw how the physician meticulously examined his entire body while actively listening to his complaints. Eventually, the physician came to the conclusion that the root of the issue stemmed from their feet. As a young student, I was incredibly enthralled by this finding because I would not have suspected that the cause of back pain could be from the opposite end of the body. This moment perfectly encapsulates the importance of a physician’s role in medicine because it seamlessly integrates a physician’s desire to heal with the art of problem-solving. While I am fascinated with the science behind medicine, the humanistic and investigative side of medicine continuously motivates me to become an influential leader within the medical field. Through my experiences, I have realized that I have the desire and skills to bring trust, empathy, and an inquisitive mindset to medical care as a physician. 

I am a unique individual who enjoys concrete facts yet also believes in abstract ideas such as astrology and karma, but one of my strongest beliefs is that everything happens for a reason. My “everythings” have allowed me to grow into an independent and optimistic person who has learned how to cope with loss, failure, and becoming perseverant. Learning how to maintain hope, losing a friend at a young age, and utilizing a restorative mindset to assist others have all augmented my ability to think analytically and become resilient in the face of adversity. I am determined to bring my growing enthusiasm and knowledge to medical school and evolve as an influential individual within the medical community. At the end of the day, medicine is the closest thing to a miracle, and I understand how imperative it is to be the difference between life and death.","While mentoring underserved students of eastern Richmond, VA, I came to understand that having humility is not a sign of weakness. As I learned about parents losing custody due to drug abuse, six-year-olds wrestling with homelessness, and young students grieving siblings who were subjected to gun violence, I saw that, while I could escape tragedy by turning off news media, that is not an option for these children. This made me recognize and critically analyze how my upbringing selectively limited my understanding of others‚Äô cultural and socioeconomic issues. By boldly evaluating how my sheltered background may have impacted my comprehension of these topics, I have been motivated by a persistent desire to learn more about the challenges that marginalized communities face. I am passionate about cultivating an inclusive environment within medicine by embracing all dimensions of the human condition and advocating for equity.","I recall a patient coming in for her annual check-up. When I asked if she had any concerns to ask the doctor about, she hesitated. She motioned to a small brown spot on her shoulder, but she didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of it. I reassured her that even if it turned out to be nothing, it‚Äôs best to have the doctor inspect it. When the physician looked at the area, he took a biopsy, and referred the patient to a dermatologist. The results came back as squamous cell carcinoma, one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer. When I called the patient with the results, she profusely thanked me for my advocacy. My impact on this patient‚Äôs life showed me that medicine encompasses more than an understanding of tangible entities such as the science of diseases and treatments. Instead, it requires empathy, dedication, and curiosity. These are skills I have developed through my experiences and aim to continue augmenting at Rush College of Medicine.

I know this because any chance I get to be even remotely involved in healthcare, my motivation and passion are unlike anything that I have ever seen in myself.

Volunteering at Banner Gateway’s emergency department was my first exposure to working in healthcare. At that point I had only shadowed before, and I was never fully responsible for any aspect of patient care. I knew the shifts in a busy emergency department were going to be difficult, but I was not prepared for just how intense they actually were. By the end of my first day, I was exhausted. My feet hurt from constantly moving all day and after I got home, I immediately went to lay on the floor because I wanted to be cooled off. My mind and body were completely drained and yet, my heart was so full. I felt so accomplished with how my first day went. 

Virtually all I did was room patients, answer their call lights, and clean their rooms. There was a moment that I got to see a glimpse of treatment for a critical patient but even then, from where I was standing, I only saw a crowd of people huddled around the bed in the treatment room. But that swarm of healthcare providers working in lifesaving, ordered chaos is an image that still stays with me to this day. 

I started thinking about why I was so elated about handing out warm blankets or only staring at a group of healthcare workers from a distance. I came up with two reasons and they are the same as the reasons why I want to become a doctor: my passion for medicine and my desire to help others. 

I chose to be a pre-med major going into my undergraduate degree because of my interest in medicine. Learning biology and chemistry my freshman and sophomore year was intriguing. However, sitting in lecture halls only allowed me to begin considering a medical career. It was not until I directly saw the application of these subjects in a healthcare setting, that my passion truly grew. Volunteering in the ED, I finally saw how my education was directly related to patient care. I got to ask about the labs and medications being ordered, and I was so elated when my physiology knowledge allowed me to grasp what was happening. There were finally real EKGs that weren’t just practice problems from my homework. I saw how reading them led to actual diagnoses for patients. Most interesting to me was getting to hear doctors’ thoughts during treatment. Whether it was treating a simple ankle sprain or saving a patient’s life, I was so fascinated at how they decided what needed to be done. I went into this opportunity knowing that I enjoyed medicine, but I was surprised by just how much fervor I had for this field.

My desire to good for the world is also the result of my want to attend medical school. This is not necessarily in some grand way though; I do not claim to be some kind of martyr. But I am content if I can just make one person’s day even slightly better. This mindset that has been a theme throughout my entire life. When I was in elementary school, there was a heart disease fundraiser called Jump Rope for Hearts. My teacher explained that donating would help research diseases and help a lot of people who are sick. After I got home, I immediately went for my Buzz Lightyear piggy bank. I had spent a few years saving up that money and as a second grader, that was basically half of my life. However, I was not the least bit sad to donate all my savings. I knew that it was going to a good cause and that I was contributing to the care of others. As I got older, I started volunteering at my mom’s Vietnamese center. I was able to teach Vietnamese and spread the culture in an underrepresented area. Helping second-generation Vietnamese children, like myself, get in touch with their heritage grew my aspiration to serve the community even further. 

This is why even doing menial tasks while volunteering in the emergency department only inspired me to complete my goals more so than ever before. Knowing that my actions could ease their pain, even a little bit, was a life-changing experience. As a young adult, I am still discovering who I am. My values, personality, and demeanor have changed a lot over the years. Recognizing this, I am often hesitant to say things that are extreme or absolute because I might not believe in them anymore as I mature. But the two exceptions to that are my passion for medicine and my desire to help people. These values have stayed with me since childhood, and I will continue to foster their growth in every way that I can through my education and career. I believe that as a doctor, I will have the opportunity to improve the well-being of patients and pursue the life-long process of medical education. I have an insatiable passion for both these values, and that is why I want to go to medical school.","As an Asian person growing up in a predominantly white area, I was an outsider. The model minority stereotypes I heard from my classmates were dehumanizing. I hesitated to participate in class because I knew I would be ridiculed for answering questions correctly. I believed I had to ignore this ‚Äúdark humor‚Äù to be accepted. But trying to fit in meant I was never able to express myself fully. I was just the Asian guy who wasn‚Äôt offended, the scapegoat for white kids to point to after telling a racist joke._x000D_

My childhood has shown me the unfair treatment people experience when not part of the status quo. In medicine, Latinos, Black people, women, and LGBT people have inequitable care due to biases, socioeconomic disparity, and political attacks. A massive failure of our institutions is giving unfit healthcare to the social minority. As a medical student and future doctor, I will work to make sure none of my colleagues or patients ever feel like they are outsiders due to their differences.","One way I have impacted my community is by reducing food insecurity. I volunteer for Meals on Wheels through the Gilbert Senior Center. We deliver lunches to people who are elderly, disabled, living in poor conditions or all of the above. I have gotten to know the people on my delivery route well. It gives me gratification to provide them with a meal they can always depend on. I also provided residents in my county with information about COVID while I was a Maricopa case investigator. I collected epidemiological data for the department of health and directed people to resources for food and shelter. These experiences have further incentivized me to pursue medicine because I know that as a doctor, I will be able to help people in ways that align with my passion for healthcare.",,,1,"I initially did not seek in-person clinical experience or volunteering when COVID began. I was concerned for my family‚Äôs health and mostly stayed home until I was vaccinated. Along with this, I chose to focus my thesis because of the issues that also arose due to COVID. As a result, I lost out on almost a year of valuable experiences. But, I still tried to do as much as I could. I participated in remote public health initiatives like the COVID case investigator for Maricopa County. And now, I have taken this gap year to work in the emergency department and volunteer at Meals on Wheels.",0,0,1

Every year on the last Saturday in April, my dad and I are here for the opening day of trout season. In the previous 12 years, I can count on one hand how many times I have successfully tempted a fish to run away with my lure. This never seems to be a problem for my father- he always out-catches me. As I grew older, catching fish became less important. Going fishing meant spending time with my dad, who instilled in me his love for the outdoors. When he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, I understood that the future of our active lifestyles was uncertain. I knew I wanted to be a physician before my father was diagnosed as I had spent dozens of hours volunteering in my small-town hospital's emergency room, helping in little ways to care for patients. In the years that followed his diagnosis, my decision to go to medical school became ever more solidified. It was humbling to see the effects of serious illness when it struck someone I loved. Journeying with my family through Parkinson’s disease set my expectations of what it means to practice medicine well. Empathetic, patient-centered approaches to care define physicians who made meaningful impacts on our family. I pursue medicine to take that same approach with others. 

Early on, I learned that Parkinson’s is a complex disease. In the confusion of symptoms and treatment options my family found itself were physicians who took the time to teach us about what was going on. Explaining the pathology illuminates my understanding of the disease, bringing me a sense of peace. I appreciated being drawn a diagram about where Dr. Air was going to place the probes during my dad’s deep brain stimulation surgery. This commitment to teaching brought a sense of empowerment to our family. We learn, ask questions, and come to an understanding of the disease, allowing us to make well-informed decisions. I pursued chemistry education research and teaching opportunities in college to get a grasp of what effective teaching looks like. I applied the constructive teaching and learning strategies shown by my research to my classroom as a graduate student instructor so that students may better understand complex chemical phenomena. I consider the various effective ways to teach chemistry and apply the best techniques based on the needs of the individual student, allowing space for questions and independent inquiry. In doing so, I prepare myself to emulate the example of my father’s physicians in my own practice of medicine.

Accompanying my father on his journey with Parkinson’s taught me to value the empowerment stemming from a caregiver-patient partnership. My dad’s doctors seek to understand him as a human being- someone with aspirations and fears. These relationships were impactful in my role as the family member. In my job as a patient companion in the hospital, I see how valuable these relationships are to me in my role as a caregiver. Taking the time to get to know my patients takes our relationship to a deeper place. I learned that taking the time to form a genuine connection with my patient allows me to understand the life experiences they bring with them to the hospital. I learn their needs and goals, which augments my ability to provide them with personalized care. During one conversation with a patient, I learned that she loved apple juice but could not drink it because it caused her to aspirate. I knew we had a thickening agent at the nurses 'station, so after gaining consent from her nurse, I was able to prepare some thickened apple juice for her, which brought a smile to her face. Cultivating relationships with a new patient every shift is my favorite part of my job. I leave each night wanting to continue to work with patients as a physician, where I can be a stronger advocate for their needs.

My parents brought me up in the Catholic Church. Although I have left behind copious Church teachings, I retain a sense of personal responsibility to accompany those facing hardship, particularly poor and marginalized communities. I thank the Jesuits for this aspect of my life. It was because of the Jesuits that I became so involved with marginalized groups in my own community. In their faces, I saw my dad, who has access to the resources he needs to manage his Parkinson’s disease and nurture a fruitful life. To those for whom healthcare injustice is a reality, I desire to use my privilege as a physician to be an ally for them and with them, working to cultivate a sense of hope and assuring them that they need not face challenges alone. This is the altruism that was shown to my family in our time of need. I feel compelled to return that to someone else. 

My family found hope in the warmth and benevolence of physicians who took the time to empathize with us and the unique circumstances we brought to the clinic. Their patient-centered approach means that my dad can continue to catch more fish than me on the Slagle Creek. I am pursuing medicine to provide the same personalized approach to medicine that I know makes a difference in the lives of those affected by illness.","‚ÄúSo, where are you from?‚Äù This was the most popular question at the ice cream social during move-in day my first year at the University of Michigan. In keeping with tradition as a native Michigan resident, I held up my right hand and pointed to a small wrinkle just above my wrist. ‚ÄúAdrian,‚Äù I replied, ‚Äúfarm country.‚Äù My hometown is rural, surrounded by corn and soybean fields or the occasional dairy farm. Growing up in a small town means I am no stranger to rural culture and the challenges rural communities face. That dish of ice cream on move-in day marked the beginning of a new learning opportunity: attending college in a big city. The city and university brought me to worldviews and backgrounds considerably different from my rural upbringing, giving me an appreciation for how others see the world. As a result of living in both rural and urban areas, I feel comfortable interacting with people from both communities and can contribute to conversations about rural and urban life.","During one of my shifts as a patient companion, I helped to care for an eight-year-old boy awaiting placement in a pediatric mental health facility. He was in foster care, and his patient companion was the only person in the room to engage with him. I empathized with how tricky the situation was for him and tried to find things for us to do to keep him engaged. My mind turned to sports upon seeing his plastic ball. I thoroughly sanitized his bedside commode and turned it into a basketball hoop. We practiced shooting and had a ‚Äútrick shot‚Äù competition. After that, I took a fitted sheet used on the stretchers and finagled it into a makeshift soccer net, and we played soccer. I did similar activities with him over the next several days until he was discharged. I believe that my willingness to engage his mind and body helped ease some of his frustrations about having to stay in the hospital and improved some of the emotional difficulties of his social situation with foster care.

In his efforts to avoid living under an authoritarian regime, he guided his family through rocky mountains and turbulent rivers to reach safety. He shared with me his hopes for future generations to help people improve their lives — contrasting from the destructive oppression he narrowly escaped. Hence, when I was born as his first grandson, he chose my Korean name to be “Min-Gi,” roughly translating to “a foundation for the people.” After working in impoverished areas like Victorville, California, a medically underserved city, I have discovered how I can live up to my name’s meaning. My family's history and experiences within the hospices and hospitals of San Bernardino County, California sparked my resolve to serve and empower marginalized communities through medicine.

My first patient assigned to me as a hospice volunteer was “Mary,” a 71-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer, liver metastases, and only three months to live. Entering her home, I was surprised to see that Mary and her family lived in their landlord’s garage, with Mary herself only occupying one small corner. Bedridden, she could only interact with her daughter, granddaughter, and medical staff. I provided her with companionship during such a difficult time, discussing her memories of the San Diego docks during her 20s and reminiscing over nostalgic memories with her to detract her thoughts from her diagnoses. Getting to know Mary for three months, I contemplated the escalation of medical conditions. It became apparent that having an illness was not only a result of diseased tissue but also a culmination of biopsychosocial challenges: deteriorating mental health from stress, lack of social support, and insecure living conditions. My newly discovered cognizance of these pervasive entities instilled my passion for serving vulnerable individuals, and I became eager to provide such care as a physician.

While working as an emergency room (ER) scribe, I was intrigued by the myriad of societal issues subsuming the physician-patient relationship in communities with limited access to healthcare and housing services. During one shift, a 12-year-old named “Aiden” experiencing homelessness came into the ER due to auditory hallucinations and methamphetamine abuse, with psychiatric evaluations suggesting a history of psychosis. Hoping to ensure his comfort while nurses were understaffed, I brought him blankets and food as he anxiously awaited an update. I then saw how my physician kneeled next to him, using simple vocabulary to gently explain the rehabilitation and psychiatric treatment he needed, the patient’s face softening as he chose to trust us. I shared notes with the physician on Aiden’s condition and lab results. The doctor called any facilities he could, determined to find Aiden a psychiatric facility more advanced than the local ones. With Aiden’s successful transfer, I was reminded not only of the empathy a physician must have for patients but also their role in patient advocacy. I became inspired by the opportunity to create lasting impacts for patients undergoing difficult circumstances and earn their trust for the maximization of their care.

While ER doctors work with patients in the short term, I also yearned to understand how a physician creates a long-term, individualized care plan for underserved patients. This led to me serving as a scribe in a private clinic, where I assumed more responsibility by talking to patients over the phone about their medical needs. One morning, I talked to “Deborah,” a 45-year-old woman with colorectal cancer and several comorbidities. Hearing her sobbing, I listened carefully as she talked about her cancer treatments being “in limbo” since she could not reach her last doctor, being from an area with low physician-to-patient ratios. Recognizing this as a precedent issue, I assured her I would bring the doctor’s attention to her case. Despite a busy schedule, the doctor and I went through each concern she presented. For two weeks, I called pharmacies to ensure her medications went through and contacted the oncologist’s office to ensure they received the medical records necessary for her appointment. Successfully obtaining specialized care for Deborah resonated with me as I aspire to use my medical knowledge to critically consider appropriate treatments and center care on relationships with the patient.

Having served on the periphery of the physician-patient relationship for several years and currently gaining more intimate patient experiences as a family medicine scribe, I eagerly anticipate a future in which I am caring for my own patients. Through patients like Mary, Aiden, and Deborah, I know there are individuals without adequate healthcare with unique needs and circumstances. My goal is to be an empathetic, holistic doctor who proactively engages patients while being mindful of their environments. My desire to uphold the meaning of the name given to me by my grandfather holds true, as I heal, educate, advocate, and create a foundation for patients to further build their lives upon.","I participated in the Multicultural Institute Program (MSI), a program for first-year students from various cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds to engage in discussions on social justice. Our lectures focused on the experiences of youth as they constructed their identities within their communities and created a foundation for discussions about oppression students faced. I gained a broader perspective on societal discrimination and realized the importance of providing a safe space for people to share their vulnerabilities. After graduating, I observed how societal challenges impact medicine. As an ER scribe, I met patients afraid their diagnoses would be stigmatized due to their identity, giving me a better understanding of why patients withhold care. I fostered a desire to advocate for all people, allowing them to pursue their interests, uninhibited by illness. I want to encourage discussions on societal injustices and stimulate dialogue to enact change within the medical field. ","My experience tutoring elementary students for the Asian American Tutorial Project has been instrumental in understanding the significance of encouraging those I serve like with ‚ÄúJill‚Äù During a session, she tearfully told me she dreamed of being a scientist but was discouraged due to her struggles with her life science classes. Understanding her frustration, I worked with Jill on science passages not only to help her become more comfortable with the concepts, like cellular organelles and photosynthesis, but also encourage her to continue pursuing her ambitions of becoming a scientist. I remember how Jill became ecstatic when I told her the progress she made was evidence that she could become a scientist. Seeing her grades and hope improve, I learned the importance of motivating individuals to pursue their goals. I want to carry the same lessons as a physician by invigorating my patients to not be discouraged by setbacks and push through obstacles to reach their health goals.",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, I was disappointed that my volunteering experiences were halted. As a result, I felt useless when moving back home. These feelings were exacerbated when my grandmother was diagnosed with COVID-19 after suffering a stroke in a nursing home. Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away later that month and my grief lasted for months. When she was later moved to the ICU, I worried even more about her condition. Amidst my grief, I thought about other families that had lost loved ones due to the virus‚Äô impact on vulnerable communities. Determined to contribute to care for such communities, I began scribing for ER physicians as they cared for underserved patients. I am proud of the impact I had in assisting physicians with their charts, easing their workload, and allowing them to efficiently see more patients. The struggles I witnessed others face with COVID in the ER truly put my own problems into perspective and reaffirmed my interest in medicine.",1,0,2

While I did not understand the difficult decisions, years of school and training, heartbreak, and responsibility that comes with wearing a white coat, I did understand that it represented empathy, conscientiousness, and knowledge. Throughout college, I followed a traditional pre-medicine path where I shadowed and took prerequisite courses. While these experiences reaffirmed my goal to become a physician, I was still searching for a deeper reason to fully commit to the profession.

June 27, 2020, the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the day before I took the MCAT for the first time, and also the day my life changed forever. My mother had been experiencing shooting pain in her abdomen before she scheduled a colonoscopy. She came home with a procedure report that contained a bleak diagnosis: stage IV colon cancer. I spent the remainder of that night sitting in my room feeling hopeless. The next morning, I took the MCAT, and instead of focusing on the test in front of me, I could not stop thinking about my mother’s health. Thoughts like, “How long until mom isn’t in my life anymore?,” and “Do I need to delay my senior year of college to help the family?,” occupied my thoughts. Thus, it was no surprise that my score was less than ideal.

My mother spent months undergoing chemotherapy. In the seventh month, I woke up to multiple missed calls from my father. I sat on the edge of my bed for half an hour before making the six-hour drive home. When I arrived, she was already in a coma. The next week consisted of driving family members to the hospital and spending a few hours each night in the ICU to relieve my father of his duties. On the third day, a stranger approached me. He knew my name and asked how my senior year was going. As the conversation continued, he asked about my siblings and it became apparent that he was my mother’s doctor. Dr. Kocs’ eyes filled with tears as he extended his condolences, but the moment we walked out of the elevator and through the ICU doors, he became a different person. Dr. Kocs’ effortless empathy quickly became a focused review of the information on my mother’s chart. After a moment, he looked up at my father and I and gently delivered the bad news. “Her liver is shut down, and her kidneys are not far behind.” Amidst my family’s devastation, it was comforting to see that Dr. Kocs was not only an oncology expert but also an empathetic person. The pandemic robbed me of my ability to be by my mother’s side during her time in the hospital, but I was relieved that Dr. Kocs cared for her as a patient and a mother with a life beyond the hospital doors. 

After my mom passed, I decided to give back by working as a medical assistant and scribe at a gastroenterology clinic, as well as learn more about the disease that took my mother’s life. When I interviewed with Dr. Chua, he explained that dozens of patients called his practice every month asking to be seen for a procedure because local hospitals had over a month-long wait before they could be seen. I could not help but reflect on the parallels to my mother's situation. Seeing how he cared about treating his patients regardless of the strain it put on him reminded me of my interaction with Dr. Kocs. When working during clinical rounds, I saw Dr. Chua genuinely celebrate his patients that successfully lost the recommended twenty pounds or made the advised lifestyle change. Seeing how these small connections visibly change patients’ attitudes, and ultimately their health, has reinforced my decision to pursue medicine. 

While bedside manner is a complex variable to operationalize, my experiences with my mother’s care and time spent working as a scribe have shown me that bedside manner clearly affects patient outcomes. A 2014 literature review by John Kelley, et al., assessed the effect of patient-clinician relationships on healthcare outcomes by looking at factors such as adherence to treatment and patient satisfaction.* While this study could not quantify the strength of these relationships, there was a link between prioritization of holistic patient care and the quality of treatment. My mom had an incurable disease and the only course of action was to find treatments that could extend her life while maintaining her quality of living. In situations like this, patients spend hours in the hospital every week. Physicians that are willing to spend extra time to get to know the person they are treating make an impactful difference. This is what I aspire to be, a physician that goes beyond the standard treatment of disease and takes a few extra moments to ensure that every patient feels cared for and heard. Looking back on the past two years, I am humbled and grateful for the experiences that have led me to where I am today because I can now confidently say I have found my deeper meaning for pursuing a career in medicine.

I did not think anything of it when we first moved in, but throughout the year, we talked about why he fasts for Ramadan, his native language of Gujarati, and his upbringing. I was most interested in the purpose of the religious acts he chose to participate in. _x000D_
_x000D_
Even though my roommate and I had led very different lives, our bond grew when we talked about our differences. During the Fall, we spent Sundays watching football together and telling college stories, but I never felt like I knew him until I learned about his culture and religion. This was a large part of his life, and I did not want it to be a topic that was avoided because of my lack of understanding. Once these conversations started, my roommate wanted to teach me how to make the foods he grew up eating and introduce me to the community he grew up in. I saw how powerful it was for me to learn about his culture because it made him feel accepted despite our differences. _x000D_
","In the Fall of 2021, I began working with Dr. Basapur on a research project at the Oakley Square Apartments, just five minutes from Rush. This project focused on gaining insight into how Rush could improve upon its community clinic model. I worked with eight teenage males during this project, and in November, they left us with one request: a teen night program. _x000D_

After explaining the purpose of our project, the room fell silent until one of the kids said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs college like?‚Äù None of the teens had anyone in their life that talked about or went to college.

My family would visit India often, and I would spend most of my summer vacations listening to his childhood stories. A common myth told in the Southeast Asian community was that the elders in the family will only be proud of their children if they choose a career in a STEM-related field. That myth became a reality as I started to notice my friends’ STEM futures were all being planned out as early as elementary school. I was 10 when my grandfather asked me what I wanted to do in life. I wholeheartedly believed that I would share the same fate as my friends. I responded by saying, “I guess anything science-related, grandfather. I only want to make you proud.” He chuckled and told me that he’d be proud of me regardless of what career I chose. He would be content as long as it was the path that I would place all my effort in. Never would I have thought that these very few words my grandfather said would be the reason as to why I chose medicine.
 
I was in high school when I had the opportunity to visit my cousins in Texas for spring break. My cousin planned out a thorough spring break plan for us, which somehow included waking up at 6 a.m. every morning to go to work with his neighbor. I argued that I did not want to go, but he insisted that we stick to his plan. The next morning, my cousin opens the door to a woman wearing a white coat and blue scrubs and says, “It’s time to get going guys. Let’s go to the hospital!” My first impression of the operating room was the amount of silence that filled the room, but then everyone’s movement began to have its unique sound. This is the moment when I realized the art behind medicine. Each medical professional seen through the glass of the operating room was a member of the Beethoven-Esque symphony. At the center of it all was Dr. Basi, conducting the whole performance. The anesthesiologist was the lead in her section and performed her first solo. The solo went smoothly and the patient was put under, quicker than minute rice. With a quick signal from Dr. Basi, the OR nurses harmonized and handed the lead surgeon the vital instruments for the upcoming transition. With each precise incision and suture, the surgeon was introducing new instrument duets in the symphony. I observed three of Dr. Basi’s symphonies that day, each one more flawless than the previous. While everyone in the observation room heard silence, I heard beauty behind the glass. All I could think about was how a unit of people could hold a precious life in their hands and give them the future that they deserved. There was no time to ask for an encore, but I vowed to return in order to experience it all over again. This time as a performer.
 
As a step toward that goal, I pursued the opportunity to work as an Emergency Department medical scribe for a few months during undergrad, and this experience changed my life. I was now part of a section in the orchestra, and I could finally display my abilities. I realized that the symphony did not end in the OR and that the real peak occurred post-treatment. There was one instance during my time as a scribe that reinforced my belief that this is where I belong. “Molly” presented to the emergency department with a severe migraine. She looked at Dr. Martinez and noted the troubles she was facing in her personal life, and how her migraine kept worsening. After doing a physical examination, Dr. Martinez told her she is a strong woman and that it’s okay to fall apart sometimes. He gave her words of strength that instantly washed away her teary-filled eyes. Dr. Martinez’s words shed light on what my grandfather told me as a young girl.
 
After my fifth day of floor training, my mentor evaluated me based on my patient reports and pointed out my mistakes. He bluntly told me that I wasn’t ready to work on my own. I locked myself in my car afterward and was shattered. Then I heard my grandfather’s voice in the back of my head. If this was my purpose in life, I knew that it was not going to be an easy one. From that night onwards, I started to practice writing out stronger HPI’s and had my chief scribe give me feedback on them. The next day I had floor training, I showcased well-written patient charts. Many providers mentioned how they had been noticing my improvements and have noted they enjoyed working with me. Hearing their comments was great but nothing compared to knowing that I played a role in changing a patient’s life for the better. I did belong here.
 
My dream of becoming a doctor was not forced upon me. I may not have been born with this dream in mind. My grandfather’s wise words were a catalyst, but the journey of finding my passion in medicine was done all on my own. I want to become the first doctor in my family because I know that it is my true purpose in life. When my dream was challenged by a peer of mine while being a scribe, my dream’s autoimmune system instantly combated the challenge. This is my dream and the feeling from listening to Dr. Martinez’s words, only solidified it. I only hope that I can inspire other young women, just like how my grandfather did. Any dream is attainable if passion goes beyond bounds, and most importantly if it’s your own.","Most of my extended family resides in India, and we visit them every 2-3 years. One instance that I believe enhanced my ability to understand those unlike myself was one summer in India. It was my birthday, and my uncle had insisted that we go to a blind and deaf orphanage to give out candy to all the children. I thought it would not be very comforting, but the moment I walked in, I was greeted with tons of smiles and hugs. Some children were my age, and my soul felt so warm to see those who couldn't see or hear me be so happy. They've never met me before but saw me as a friend giving them a small gift. I realized that these children who don't live the same life as me were still thankful that my uncle and I came to give them something as minuscule as a piece of chocolate. At that moment, I learned that regardless of who I was, I was welcomed because I could provide that belongingness that these children sought. I know I will do the same for my patients as a physician.","Working as a medical assistant made me realize the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in medicine. The number of phone calls I had to make to patients to remind them that their prescription was sent and hearing that they can't pick it up because they cannot afford it truly upset me. Working in medicine is to provide and help the community, but I felt like I was not doing my job after getting off the phone with one of my patients who could not afford to pay for his insulin pens. After talking to the provider, I asked the patient if he would be willing to join a cost-effective medication program. After getting the physician's approval and the patient's permission, I helped this patient get the medication he needed. At this moment, I realized how important it was to listen to the patient. I will contribute my passion for medicine and show my care towards my patients to ensure they are heard. ",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic did not impact my application to medical school as much as I thought it would. I did have some shadowing opportunities lined up that I could not follow through with due to the pandemic; however, I was involved in virtual shadowing, where I shadowed physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants virtually. The pandemic has better prepared me for medical school because I also got involved in the Art of Living Foundation, a meditation group. My meditation instructor, a current medical student, stated that she finds meditating helpful because she likes taking 20-25 minutes of her day to focus on calming her mind before spending hours with patients and learning a plethora of information. I decided to share this practice with pre-health students and organized a virtual meditation practice. All in all, I learned to adapt to what was happening during the pandemic and tried to be involved in medicine as much as I could.",1,0,1

The dog suffers from severe illnesses and initially shows no signs of improvement. However, the boy never gives up on the dog and ultimately nurses him back to health. Little did I realize, the boy in the story signified my mother, as I was frequently riddled with fevers and severe allergies. As I grew older, I would become more like the boy. 
Since age 4, I was frequently rushed to the ER for severe fevers ranging from allergic reactions to infections. The front desk receptionists knew me and my protocols well. Constantly ill, I watched while the other kids played. Like in the folktale, I knew that with steadfast perseverance, I could get better. I would not give up on myself just like the boy did not give up on his dog. I would run alongside the field to build endurance, practice basketball to improve coordination, and construct castles in the sandbox. One day, I saw another boy playing alone and asked, “Hey, do you want to play?” We played multiple rounds of basketball and he exclaimed, “Wow! I didn’t know you can play that well being sick.” I recruited more kids and we ultimately started our own team. Just like how the boy never gave up on his dog, I never gave up, not on myself or on any other child.
In university, I joined Alpha Phi Omega, a service fraternity. As an active member, I supported pledges with service and interview requirements. A pledge confided in me saying, “I don’t know if this is manageable, classes are rough right now.” I listened carefully and together we devised a plan. “In-between your 2pm and 4pm class, you can fit two interviews. You can interview someone over dinner or through hangouts.” Not only did this pledge succeed, she later led the Pledge Committee. I was later elected Financial Vice President and responsible for all budget decisions. In the past, the fraternity spent most of its budget on the first half of the quarter, with little funds remaining. Several members wanted a catered banquet. During planning meetings, they argued, “We need this to be big so we can get more members,” and ignored others’ concerns. Instead of criticizing or complaining, I proposed an alternative. “How about a potluck? We’d save money and it would be fun to cook together.” They agreed and we collected ingredients, coordinated ovens, and prepared dishes ranging from pastas to whole chickens. The event brought in 60+ new members, which boosted our service hours. We used remaining funds for new tents (the fraternity has previously thought this much-needed purchase wouldn’t be possible) and planned a camping trip for new pledges. Just like in the medical field, creativity, connection, and support are important in all aspects of my life. Whether dancing, volunteering with youth, or welcoming new peers and colleagues to campus, I never give up and I continue to become more like the boy in the story.
As leader of multiple dance teams and youth volunteer groups, I appreciate the importance of ongoing support. New dancers often doubt themselves. Many express fears such as, “I don’t want to embarrass myself” and “I’m not getting it.” A teammate struggled with practice so I took time to help her prepare. I know that healing and support take many forms. We strategized, “Let’s meet after class and head to the gym.” I provided positive reinforcement with critiques like “I love how you hit those angles with your arms but make sure to keep your form tight.” We practiced late, joked, and bonded over our struggles with the wave. Not only did my teammate’s skills improve, her entire outlook changed. She ultimately became better than me in a lot of movements and would later join a top tier competitive dance team. Like in the folktale, the boy needed a supportive environment if he wanted to help his dog. I strive to create such environment for everyone I work with, from beginning dancers to the sick to the youth. 
As a Ronald Reagan Hospital volunteer, I often shared stories, both my own and the folktale. On breaks, I’d play with young patients while they'd wait for appointments. While we’d build towers out of blocks or solve puzzles, we’d talk. I noticed one of the kids isolated from the other toys and I sat next to him and asked, “Do you want to play?” His face lit up. We struggled but didn’t give up when our blocks toppled. When we finished, his face darkened and I asked, “Can I tell you a story?” I told him about “The Boy and His Dog”. I assured him by saying, “I was just like you, but now I’m big and strong! If you continue to believe in yourself, then you can get better too!” As he left, he said “Thank you mister for the story, I’ll try my best!”
Each child tells their own story, and I want to help shape their narrative just like the boy in the folktale. Just as I transitioned from being the dog to the boy, I want to inspire others to make that same transition. Whether providing medical support, friendship, leadership at a time of need, or simply sharing my own story of perseverance, I will never stop working to help as many children as possible. With all the skills and life experiences at my disposal, I will continue to provide the care, given to me as a child, to others as a future physician.","During freshman year winter break, I visited my university roommate Gabe in his hometown: Clovis, CA. I volunteered with his high school club at Clovis East High School. I prepared necessities such as toothbrushes, wipes, soaps, and food to be handed out to the underserved population in the local area. A lady approached us and said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see a lot of people like you around here: People who actually care about the community. Barely anyone comes out here and helps us out anymore.‚Äù After, Gabe explained, ‚ÄúMy parents used to ask for donations too, so I try my best to help out even if it‚Äôs only a little in the long run.‚Äù I grew up in a medically represented area, so travelling to Central California where resources were limited changed my perspective. I can now better understand their struggles and properly help them with the resources available. As a future physician, I would focus my efforts on helping the medically underserved populations.  ","In undergraduate, I volunteered for Meals on Wheels in which I delivered hot meals to seniors. One day, during our last stop, one of the seniors needed help moving objects as an earthquake had hit the day before. I noticed that she was visibly shaken as her hands trembled while she was resting. Once I finished, she asked me, ‚ÄúDo you think you can stay for a while? It‚Äôs been very lonely and I‚Äôve been scared ever since yesterday.‚Äù I asked the driver to head back without me as I stayed with her. I wanted her to feel safe and secure before her daughter came to spend time with her. Little by little, she began opening up to me. She asked me, ‚ÄúWhat do you want to be when you‚Äôre older?‚Äù and I responded, ‚ÄúA doctor‚Äù. She complimented me by uttering, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre going to be a great doctor. Your constant smiles will lighten any patient up,‚Äù a statement that I still hold dear to this day. As a future physician, I aim to create a comfortable environment for my patients to share their concerns.",,,1,"Initially, my Covid-19 concerns stemmed from my mother being immunocompromised. My mother lost her job for a year during the pandemic, which put a strain on my family‚Äôs financial stability. My post baccalaureate program also transitioned to online learning. Office hours were limited and working on group projects became difficult. Additionally, I was going to start a position as a medical assistant at my local clinic, but I was let go due to Covid-19 scares. _x000D_
However, Covid-19 did not discourage me from pursuing other avenues. While my mother did not have a job, my post baccalaureate program hired me as a peer tutor. The online job helped me financially while also enriching my current knowledge.

I read books about outer space while waiting for my dad to finish working on his latest projects. He often brought prototypes home to show my siblings and me what he’d been working on. My dad always had this contagious excitement about his work, never hesitating to describe how these little devices could treat someone’s hearing loss. I was fascinated that something so small could make such a significant impact on someone’s life. Years later, my dad asked me to help him with one of his medical device projects. As we worked together to treat patients with tonal tinnitus, I internalized his passion for advancing the field of medicine and making a long-lasting impact. These early experiences led to my own motivation to explore the realm of medicine beyond the medical device industry.

During my senior year of college, I worked as a Learning Assistant (LA) for a Women’s Mental Health psychology course. Students would meet with me individually in an exercise called ‘Teach an LA,’ where they would come prepared to teach me a topic from the class’s curriculum. Most students chose to speak on the history of women’s health, the cortisol stress response, or the menstrual cycle.

One student I met with, Katie, expressed her frustrations with gender-based healthcare disparities discussed in class. She couldn’t believe that many medical conditions, such as heart attacks, are often misdiagnosed in women due to differences in presentation. I felt the same way when I first took this class. I told Katie that learning about the lack of research and understanding of gender differences in medicine provided me with an entirely new perspective on healthcare. This class had a major impact on my work as an EMT and inspired me to learn more about gender differences in various medical conditions. I wanted to understand as much as possible to provide the most effective, personalized patient care. As Katie and I continued to discuss health inequities, she shared that her mother struggled with infertility before Katie was born. Her mother’s chronic health condition was misdiagnosed for years, preventing her from having kids. I felt powerless as I continued to listen. I couldn’t shake this feeling of wanting to do more, to be an advocate, to be in a position to cure her mother and others alike.

After graduating, I started working as a clinical research assistant in a women’s behavioral health laboratory, where my first project was managing a sleep study. During an enrollment appointment, I spoke with Amy, a busy healthcare worker who struggled with getting consistent sleep. Amy told me that she had never been a good sleeper, and it worsened over the years after having “three loud boys,” she joked. As I showed Amy how to use the devices we were testing in the study, she asked me what ‘good sleep’ even means. I enjoyed answering these types of questions so I could ease any stresses a participant had about our study. We ended up speaking at length about the different stages of sleep and the various activities that could affect her sleep quality. With her newfound enthusiasm, Amy and I scheduled her follow-up appointment, and I eagerly awaited what she had to say about her experience.

Amy returned for her final screening session with a beaming smile on her face. “Henry!” she exclaimed, “I haven’t slept this well in years!” She was so eager to share her experience with me. As we discussed her improved sleep quality, she mentioned that using the study devices also helped her husband sleep better. “My husband loves them,” she laughed, “because I stopped waking him up for his loud snoring.” I was thrilled to hear the positive impact that this had on Amy’s sleep. It was motivating to see that our developing treatment dramatically improved not only her quality of life, but her husband’s as well. Working with patients like Amy inspires me to pursue a career as a physician, where I can discover and apply new methods of improving people’s health and well-being.

The curiosity and passion my dad instilled in me has driven me to seek out opportunities to make a significant impact on those around me. I want to be a part of the next generation of physicians that will fight to improve patient outcomes and mend healthcare inequities. The countless stories I have heard from people like Katie and Amy motivate me to think of all the ways I could improve the medical experiences of many. I want to be a physician that continuously strives to enhance my knowledge and understanding of medicine so I can provide personalized, high-quality patient care. The moments I have shared with patients and physicians through research and patient care have motivated me to pursue a career where I can research, develop, and apply new treatments. I want to share my contagious excitement for medicine as I strive to make a long-lasting impact through the many roles a physician fulfills.","International Day was one of my most memorable experiences growing up in Switzerland. Students and their families would come to school to share their cultural backgrounds with others through ethnic dishes, ancient games, and traditional clothing. Being exposed to diverse cultural backgrounds from a young age instilled a sense of curiosity in me to learn more about others._x000D_
_x000D_
Years later, I began volunteering at a bilingual preschool, where I assisted teachers by bridging language barriers between children. I empathized with the students who felt separated by language, as it was often something I experienced when I was younger. As a volunteer, I emulated the values my teachers instilled in me at ISL by making students feel included amongst the diverse group of kids._x000D_

I hope to grow my commitment to understanding and appreciating diverse perspectives at Rush, where I can become a physician who is a curious learner and embodies an empathetic, person-centered approach to patient care.","One of the most meaningful experiences I had while pursuing medicine was being a Learning Assistant in the psychology course Women's Mental Health.

The room was sterile, and bright and I could tell it bothered my grandfather’s eyes as he was gripping his cane, staring into his lap. On the other hand, my grandmother was used to these visits as long as I was there to help translate. At 9 years of age, I would much rather have been playing with my friends at school but understood my role as one of the only English-speakers in my household. A gentle knock on the door finally broke the silence followed by a head peeking inside. The doctor’s stethoscope was draped over his shoulders, and he looked around the room almost shocked to see so many faces. “Mr. Lule?” He hesitated for a moment, staring at my grandfather who glanced over nervously at me. I explained that they did not speak English, and I was there to translate everything into Spanish. Being sent as a translator for family members was a common occurrence, and having never met a physician who spoke Spanish, I believed it to be the norm. It wasn’t until my adolescence, when we moved to Los Angeles, that I ever met a doctor who I related to on both a linguistic and cultural level. Having a physician who could connect with my family enabled my grandparents to be their own voice at the doctor’s office and I soon noticed their increased trust in the medical system as a result.
It was from these interactions that I began to recognize the value of a diverse physician population and how it can impact patients. To this day, contributing physician diversity continues to serve as a driving force for me with hopes of being able to help families like mine and improve their care. While volunteering in the ER I had the opportunity to see how I can make a difference in this aspect of healthcare. It was amidst the constant beeping of monitors and chatter that I saw a shadow approach from the corner of my eye. His eyes darted about the lobby, and I was reminded of the same puzzled look my grandparents had whenever someone spoke English. He hesitated and asked, “¿Español?”, I nodded and replied yes in Spanish. Adolfo’s confusion melted into a grin as he stepped closer and explained that he was just told by a doctor that he needed surgery but was unsure what it meant and that he felt scared. I listened intently and after clarifying questions about the procedure, I asked what would help him feel more comfortable. Adolfo explained that religion helped him, this was no surprise to me as religion is deeply rooted within the Latino culture. I helped him locate a church in nearby suburbs and even directed him to the hospital’s chapel on the 1st floor. Unbeknownst to him, this interaction had been a highlight of my day. The conversation flowed as if he were a relative or friend and I felt honored to help comfort a patient in need. I realized during these moments that I truly long for a lifetime of forming these important connections and providing comfort to those in their most vulnerable moments.
In the ER, I also had the privilege of witnessing the role of a doctor as an educator, advocate, healthcare leader, and expert of the human body. Luke had come into the ER with complaints of abdomen pain but when asked to put on a face mask, his demeanor quickly changed from calm to irritable. Throughout the COVID19 pandemic, vaccines, virus transmission, and antibodies were common question topics asked by patients. Luke was no different, he was among the many who felt irritated by the virus and referenced social media sites as a rebuttal to masks. He confidently declared that he did not trust physicians or medical treatments, and that he only came into the hospital to put his family member’s minds at ease. It was during Luke’s care that I observed Dr. Aquino sit beside him, her eyes level with his as she calmly explained some science principles and allowed him to guide the conversation to topics that he felt passionate about. As she explained and addressed his specific questions one by one, it became clear that his mind was more at ease. And in a short matter of time his regard for the physician helping him was transformed into respect rather than skepticism. Watching this teaching moment, I began to realize that the role of physician included being a community leader, educator, and an empathetic listener. Although not all interactions with patients go as this one did, I felt confident that the role of a doctor includes weaving both health and humanity into one, a job like no other and the only one I’d want to have. Going forward, I strive to one day be able to teach and educate patients on their health and the science behind it, not only as a community leader but as a physician.
From growing up in rural California translating medical visits for my grandparents to working amongst the Latino population in a big city Emergency Room, I’ve come to recognize the importance of diversity and accessible community education in our healthcare system. Not only have my experiences in medicine guided me to the path of physician, but they’ve made the decision to serve in a Latino community inevitable. In time I aspire to gain a deeper level of medical knowledge, and have a positive and lasting impact on the lives of others.","Without saying a word he handed me a piece of paper with the name, Simon L. written on it. Looking at my list I found him easily and before I‚Äôd even asked for his ID card he placed it on the counter. As it was a particularly hot day I had been asking everyone if they wanted water and did the same with Simon. He stared blankly for a second and proceeded to point to his ear, shaking his head. Realizing he was deaf I began to understand the situation. He was clearly a repeat blood donor who through his own creativity and practice had found a way to effectively communicate his needs without issue. This experience was a reminder to always attempt to find or create accommodations for those who need them as even a small gesture can make the difference in creating a more welcoming environment. Surrounded by a world that isn‚Äôt catered towards individuals with disabilities, it‚Äôs important to be observant of the needs of others so that at least one aspect of their day can be made a little easier.","Even at our first tutor session I could tell that getting Uriel engaged in his homework was going to be a challenge. His hands fidgeted with anything in reach, and it was near impossible to have him sit in a chair for more than a minute. All he wanted to do was talk about his favorite video game, Roblox, and repeatedly asked if he could play and show me. Instead of asking him again and again to sit down and do his work, I proposed that we finish 5 homework assignments after which we could discuss anything he wanted. He loved the idea and sat down to work for the next 50 minutes and proceeded to show me his Roblox character for the remaining 10 minutes. We continued with this cycle each session and before I knew it, his mother shared with me that not only had his  academic improvement skyrocketed but that he now began to look forward to our tutoring sessions. Uriel‚Äôs new excitement to learn was a reminder that the service done for others, no matter how small, can have a lasting impact.",,,1,"May 9th, 2020, the day my youngest sister was born, was a day of excitement. Yet in the midst of all this joy was the fear of a global pandemic. Fear of contagion and hospitalization spread, and for that reason my parents decided it was best to do everything in our power to protect my baby sister. This meant not going out for anything other than necessities and resulted in me asking for a leave of absence from any in person responsibilities. Being isolated in my own home proved to be challenging as I dealt with familial issues and tried to find ways to help my community. It was during this time that I found out about the ACS advocacy branch as well as a tutoring service called AOC Homework Helpers.

While I understood the gravity of the situation, it impacted me more profoundly than I initially imagined. While he was in surgery, I sat glued to my laptop in the waiting room, researching in real time what was happening. By the time my father came out, I was bursting with questions. The medical team was gracious enough to answer them, and my father’s surgeon even offered me the opportunity to shadow him on the same surgery my father had. I could not say “yes” quickly enough.

I watched the surgeon carefully remove a blood vessel from a patient’s leg to build a bypass around the blockage in an artery in his chest. I had never seen a human heart before, and I walked out of the hospital awestruck. That was the first day I truly wanted to become a doctor. I had always been heavily involved in sports and saw a path in sports medicine. It all seemed simple enough; however, in my quest to pursue a career in medicine, I have begun to understand how much more is involved. I have many patients at a nursing home and a woman named Sarah to thank for helping me come to this realization.

I met Sarah during my early days as a clinical audiology technician. I loved working with patients, and I had mastered the technical components of the exam. However, Sarah was a new challenge: She was mentally disabled. Before I even had a chance to speak, her parents told me she would “never be able to follow the instructions.” I assured them that we would be fine, but in my head I was already anxious.

I began by explaining the test to Sarah as I would any patient, but her lack of response and attention told me I would get nowhere like that. I tried speaking more slowly and clearly; that did not work either. I began to think her parents were right: We would never complete the test. 

With frustration mounting and confidence waning, I thought of another time I had struggled, working with patients at Ridgecrest Nursing Home. When I started volunteering there, I expected the fast pace of a hospital; I could not have been more wrong. One Friday, exhausted after a long week, I wanted to just finish my work and get to my weekend. Then my director told me it was the birthday of a resident, Michael, and that we were throwing a party for him. Although exhausted, I smiled and tried to show enthusiasm. I was tasked with telling each resident about the party and walking them there. I thought, “Fifteen minutes and I can go.” I spent the next hour gingerly walking patients down the hall, constantly repeating instructions. By the time I finished, the party had already begun. I collapsed in a chair, mentally exhausted and feeling sorry for the fate of my Friday afternoon. Then a chorus of residents sang “Happy Birthday.” I will never forget the joy on Michael and his friends’ faces. My attitude changed—his joy was the ultimate reward that eclipsed my exhaustion.

A few weeks later, it was Veterans Day, and I was on my way to the nursing home again. Veterans Day has always been special in my family, so I was surprised that nothing more than a simple acknowledgment was planned, especially given how many residents had served. Thinking about the joy of Michael’s party, I decided to make Veterans Day special. I suggested we decorate and hold a special ceremony honoring our veterans. We placed flags throughout the facility and held an impromptu ceremony that brought tears to many eyes, reaffirming what I learned at the party—extra time and effort to help someone is always worth it.

I succeeded not with medical acumen, but with humanity, empathy, and patience. And that is what could also help Sarah. In medicine, following methods and rules are crucial in testing a patient. However, so are changing communication methods when necessary. Instead of continuing to tell Sarah, I decided to show her. I demonstrated how I would place the earphones in her ears, acted out how to raise her hand when a sound was heard, and modeled how she should repeat words she heard. 

She stared at me blankly for a moment, but when she smiled and gave me an emphatic thumbs up, I felt more joy and satisfaction than I could have imagined. The test took double the time it normally takes, but we got the results we needed. Moreover, Sarah’s parents could not believe what I had helped their daughter achieve. From that day forward, I have been more confident interacting with all kinds of patients, and I am always willing to take an extra moment, or several, to help them.

Seeing a human heart for the first time was incredible enough to spark my interest in medicine—and I had not yet even seen the humanity inherent in medicine. Putting myself in the patient’s shoes and listening to their thoughts and desires are just as important as running a test. My time in clinical settings has helped me understand the importance of listening to and treating each patient holistically. My dream is to work as a sports medicine physician, helping get patients healthy and back to living a pain-free life, and I now know it will take both patience and empathy to get there. Thanks to Sarah and the nursing home, I am ready for the challenge.","I was raised in South Texas by a father who grew up in Mexico and a mother who grew up in Los Angeles.

I learned that most people throughout my life focused on their differences. Even in school, I noticed that people struggled empathizing with other peoples‚Äô perspectives. In my career, I will encourage my coworkers to start from common ground‚Äîwith friends, family, and future patients. If we start with the mantra ‚ÄúWe all want to help,‚Äù we can overcome religious, cultural, or other obstacles. Using this will help me put patients at ease as I strive to become the best doctor I can be.","During my time at Baylor, one morning I attended a worship service at a local church. The facility looked ancient and the members were weary. After the service, the pastor pulled me aside to talk with him. He told me about the vision he had for the church, and asked me to help remodel the church. I was quick to say yes, and I called a meeting for my fraternity to gather members to help me on this endeavor. We spent months throwing away old equipment, placing new carpet, and painting walls. The time we spent remodeling was tough, but the thankfulness the congregation displayed made it all worth it. Even though I have graduated and left, members from my fraternity still attend the church today and provide help when needed. This experience taught me to seek opportunities to positively impact the lives of people each day. Walking into the service, I did not have any intention of remodeling a church. However, offering my assistance cultivated a friendship with a local community.",,,1,"COVID caused great change in my life. During my senior year, many of my classes shifted to digital platforms. I had planned on attending medical mission trips to Peru and Kenya. Unfortunately, both were canceled. After moving back to my hometown, I began grocery shopping for my grandparents, doing my best to minimize their exposure to the outside world. When I started working full-time in a clinic, I was required to always wear a mask and to maintain my distance from others when possible. Seeing the number of patients walking into the clinic every day made me recognize the dire need in my community. Moreover, the myriad non-medical needs of others in the community do not stop during a pandemic. I began volunteering at a local homeless shelter, and this allowed me to see how much impact I could have by using my free time to help others in dire need. I made countless memories talking with people I would have never met and learned to be more grateful for the life I live today.",0,1,1

He told me about a triathlon held in San Diego each October for individuals with physical challenges. Intrigued, I signed up to volunteer, and one early morning at the ocean's edge, I helped a woman place her prosthetic leg on a beach towel and assisted her as she hopped on one leg to join the others to get ready for the swim. I looked around and took in the sight of all the prosthetics on the beach. Each one representing an athlete’s desire to be able to “use it” despite “losing it” and be part of the world of sports. A world I had always been part of, taking my own physical mobility for granted. Volunteering with the challenged athletes opened my eyes to the empowerment they experienced by the act of participating and the health benefits of an active lifestyle.
This is when playing sports no longer centered around my own individual skills, but the rewards of contributing as a teammate and leading as a captain on three varsity sports. In basketball, as point guard, I worked hard to make sure that if I called a play, the girls knew their roles to make the execution of the play successful. In softball, there was the time that I took a line drive to the face, and I pleaded to stay in and continue to cover my responsibility of third base. And during long cross country practice runs, I knew the girls looked to me, and if I slowed down, then they might too. I felt that also setting an example academically for my teammates was important, and I was proud to be awarded student-athlete of the year, class salutatorian and acceptance to UCLA.
Many were surprised that I didn’t play sports in college, but I knew that science classes would be demanding. I did, however, find time to play 13 different intramural sports on over 30 teams. I enjoy encouraging others to lead a healthy lifestyle, which led me to the role of Risk Manager for my sorority, where I organized Risk teams to patrol events for safety issues and assist when needed. One memorable time was when a member had hit her head and was bleeding and disoriented. Despite her objection, I had to call for an ambulance. This experience allowed me to picture myself in the medical field, providing me with the opportunity to have confidence in my natural calm demeanor and quick judgment calls. I further explored my interest in medicine as a Care Extender at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. It was this hands-on experience in the hospital where I confirmed my desire to work directly in patient care.
Since graduating, to explore and understand healthcare, I began volunteering as a medical assistant intern. I started in the front office, where I learned about insurance and the importance of authorizations and referrals in order for patients to obtain the care they need. I learned how to be quick, resourceful and understanding during phone and in-person interactions to ensure smooth, productive encounters with patients. Working in the back office, I gained a hands-on approach to patient care. I roomed patients, obtained medical history, took vital signs and performed procedures, including EKGs and injections. I also had the opportunity to shadow physicians in multiple specialties, coordinate patient services, and order lab tests and ultrasound procedures. Due to my exceptional performance as an intern, I was hired full-time to work alongside physicians and train new interns. As part of this group, I also attend clinical didactic sessions, where physicians speak on and discuss important current topics in healthcare.
On weekends, I work as an Emergency Department scribe, where I write History of Present Illness and chief complaints, obtain a Review of Systems and regulate the timing of lab and imaging results. This job has allowed me to start thinking more like a physician. I have learned why the doctors are ordering specific tests and their thought processes on the differential diagnoses of the patients based on their current symptoms, medical history and results. I have seen their dedication, watching a physician do chest compressions and get a pulse, only to have to repeat this five times and ultimately have a hard conversation with the family. And later, seeing a tear roll down his face as he took a moment and watching his coworkers give him a gentle tap of acknowledgment. I recognized the human side of medicine and the privilege it would be to become a physician and connect with patients as part of a healthcare team.
To prepare for medical school coursework, I have continued to support my academics by tutoring high school and college students in calculus, biology and chemistry. Given my education and multiple exposures and experiences in healthcare, I have confirmed my decision to pursue a career in medicine. I have been very well acquainted with the impact that being a physician will have on my life, because growing up I saw my dad be able to be a physician while also being a husband, a father to me and my brothers, a coach and a teacher. I believe, given my passion to become a committed physician, I have what it takes to endure the challenging years to come.","At UCLA, I volunteered at a center for adults with memory challenges. Some of the seniors were reluctant to engage in group activities. I found that having one-on-one conversations often made them feel comfortable and open to participating. I recognized the importance of communication, active listening, and not being afraid to engage in deeper conversations. As a medical assistant near a senior living community, I have had more opportunities to work with the geriatric population. There is an older Veteran who comes in once a month. Sometimes he does not even have an appointment and simply comes in with a box of donuts (despite us being a diabetes clinic) and his own mug requesting coffee. I enjoy hearing about his time in the service and his two Yorkies. I feel that this social interaction and connecting with him is an important aspect of his medical care. My respect and admiration for this population has heightened my desire to play an impactful role in people‚Äôs lives.","I believe that I have been impactful in my community by taking on the role of an educator and mentor, facilitating information to promote learning. I was a TA during COVID, and I found that many students struggled when in-person connections were no longer available. It was rewarding to provide one-on-one support to these students. After UCLA, I joined CCPrep as a tutor and observed how high school students lacked the foundations required to progress in their subjects after a year of online learning due to COVID. I devoted time to reviewing material that was missed due to the information gaps that the online format had created. As a medical assistant in an endocrinology office, I have had the opportunity to teach new incoming interns. I also work with pharmaceutical representatives and insurance companies to advocate for the education, prevention, and treatment of diabetes. As a future medical student and physician, I will serve to improve my community through health education.",,,1,"In March of 2020, UCLA canceled in-person classes and transitioned to online learning. A research project I was working on got shut down, so the PI offered me an alternative opportunity to be their Teaching Assistant. Unfortunately, my volunteer and clinical activities at Ronald Reagan Hospital as a UCLA Care Extender were also put on pause. I am grateful that after UCLA, I was able to find two direct patient care opportunities as a medical assistant and an Emergency Department scribe. While working in these busy settings, I‚Äôve had to stay extra vigilant and take necessary precautions, not only to protect my coworkers and the patients but also to ensure that I did not bring COVID-19 home to my parents. Both of my parents have autoimmune conditions, and it has been a personal challenge to navigate work and social activities during this time.",0,0,3

Every day posed a new challenge; news stations kept a running death tally and racial divisions were obscenely apparent. I felt helpless in so many ways that I jumped on the first opportunity to fight back, to take a stand, to support those who were vulnerable and needed me. Donning my mask and poster with “Black Lives Matter” written in large black lettering, I took to the streets to march in solidarity with my friends, family, and community. I could feel the pain and hurt coursing through those around me, and I wanted to do my part to ease them. Being a witness to the disparity of my community was heartbreaking and eye-opening. This rally taught me the meaning of empathy and its importance in healing and growth. I realized how medicine can play a role in healing not only physical wounds, but social and emotional ones. The connection between medicine and social justice clicked in a new way and I understood that a career in medicine involves bringing justice to underserved communities.
My excitement for social justice and desire to connect with people prompted me to consider completing a year of volunteer service after college. I chose a program in Los Angeles that aligned with my values and goals and boarded a plane headed west. I was not concerned about the eight strangers I would be living with or assimilating to a big city, but I was scared about how well I would connect with the clients at my placement site. I had no experience working in the mental health field, in social services, or with unhoused or previously incarcerated adults. I was afraid there would be few commonalities to facilitate a connection. My first few months working as a case manager at the Alcott Center for Mental Health were challenging. I struggled with learning new lingo, navigating the unfamiliar field of social services, and feeling that I was not doing enough for my clients. But with each interaction, whether it was taking a client to the DMV to renew an ID, coordinating care with a client’s psychiatrist, or listening to a client share their struggles, I began to understand the impact that compassion has on the most vulnerable. I was finally able to see the connections I had built with clients and the many ways in which I had helped them thrive. I had listened to them, connected them to necessary resources, and provided them with a safe space to address their mental health when nobody else would. I was frustrated that I could not do more for them and missed being able to use my science knowledge within the field.
I began to reflect on why I missed science and what fueled my love of it. My first biochemistry class in college made my passion for science click in a different way than it did previously. I could see how science applied to actual people and I wanted to be a part of the larger scientific community. I started volunteering my time to assist in the Oakley Research Lab and eventually joined the lab in the fall of 2019. Being involved in research was intimidating to say the least. I was working under and alongside well-known investigators and I had very little biochemical knowledge or intuition. My time there fulfilled the need to connect my experiences and knowledge gained in the classroom and teaching labs to a long-term goal regarding a specific protein. I quickly found that lab work is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to mistakes and failures. From these challenges, I learned how to apply my forming biochemical intuition in overcoming stumbling blocks and forging a new path toward success. I was able to form a goal and take steps toward achieving it by creating protein constructs for use in functional experimentation. However, my experience with biochemical research made my passion for working with people, as opposed to petri dishes and proteins, more apparent. I enjoyed knowing my hard work would benefit the field of science, but it lacked the essential connection to people that the field of medicine provides.
My array of service and educational experiences helped eliminate other career options, and it is at the intersection of my passions for research, biochemistry, service, and community interaction that I have come to know medicine. What could’ve easily motivated me to become a social worker or academic researcher, highlighted their shortcomings and how medicine includes aspects of both. What I was looking for in my experiences and what I received were radically different. My initial impulse to serve and assist was motivated by compassion and drive for knowledge, but I gained an understanding of how to bridge the gap between emotion, humanity, and science. I realized that service and learning take many forms, like volunteering at a mental health clinic, researching proteins in the Oakley Lab, and marching against hate. These experiences have given me fresh eyes and newfound confidence that pursuing medicine is the only way that I can impact my community and be fulfilled. I was not expecting to confront my calling to medicine at a Black Lives Matter protest, but it changed my life in a profound way; medicine was no longer just whispering to me, it was calling to me, and I am ready to answer.","I completed a year of post-graduate volunteer service, working full-time as a mental health case manager in Los Angeles. Moving from a small town in Indiana to a big city like LA was a huge change in diversity. As a case manager, I assisted people experiencing houselessness, substance use disorders, mental health struggles, and previous incarceration. Most of my clients were of different religious, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds than myself. Providing resources and emotional support to clients with such diverse backgrounds was challenging and rewarding. I learned how to be more sensitive to these differences and use these differences to understand and connect. I know more about different religious and cultural customs because of my relationships with clients, and I am grateful to have broadened my world view. The most important lesson I learned through my interactions with diverse communities is that we all have the same goals and wishes: to be understood, respected, and loved.","During my year of volunteer service, I lived with eight other women. We collaborated on expectations for shared food, finances, cars, responsibilities, and living space. Although we were strangers when we moved in together, we became friends throughout the course of the year. With each of my community mates, I fostered unique friendships, some deep and heavy and others fun and light. Each of us experienced challenges throughout the year, and much of our non-profit work was emotionally and physically draining. In my community, I played the role of active listener, unwavering supporter, and comedian. Without my unique traits, the community would have lacked the sensitivity and levity that I provided. I taught each person to value themselves, demand respect, and forgive when mistakes are made. I witnessed these skills bolster confidence in my community mates‚Äô interactions with others and strengthen their self-care routines. My example and guidance impacted the lives of my community.",,,1,"Before the pandemic, my path to medicine would have been traditional. However, the concurrence of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter Movement forced me to consider an alternative path to medicine by incorporating my passions for service and justice. The pandemic provided creative ways to gain shadowing experiences, offered a unique perspective on medicine, and allowed me to build confidence engaging in telemedicine. Despite these opportunities, I desired connection beyond a screen. I wanted to practice applying my passions and skills in a clinical setting, and my time as a case manager allowed me to do that. I was able to experience a hybrid clinical environment akin to the current medical atmosphere. The pandemic provided a reflection space that allowed me to consider a year of service. From this, I gained valuable clinical experience, knowledge, and growth. My year of service, and inadvertently the pandemic, solidified my desire to pursue medicine.",1,1,2

Taking in this scene from the open jeep bumping down the dirt road, I imagine what it would be like to live in this breathtaking paradise. It seems like a utopia until I remember that many of the inhabitants of Armenia, Colombia lack many basic human necessities such as sanitation, safe housing and education.  This was my second visit to this part of the world to work for a nonprofit organization called Imagina. This organization was created to provide a safe haven and education for poor kids on the streets of the city, and to keep them from falling into the gang and drug culture. Before the trip, I developed and obtained funding for a summer educational program to offer the children swimming and English lessons.  It turned out to be one of the most memorable and meaningful experiences of my life.  I learned to understand a new perspective of the world through the children and the differences in our ways of life. I learned a lot about myself as well, how much I love connecting with people from other cultures. I also learned how much I enjoy serving people wherever and whenever I can. This experience motivated me to join mission trips to El Salvador and the Philippines, and work in homeless shelters in Baltimore City.  Most importantly I learned that compassion for others enhances one’s ability to do any service-oriented job better and with purpose.  I believe compassion and service must be integrated into the work of a good doctor.
Growing up in a medical family has allowed me to find models of good healthcare workers, and has nurtured my desire to work among such people. My mother, a nurse practitioner, and my father, a transplant surgeon, met through their shared patients with kidney failure. I have witnessed firsthand their dedication, commitment, and enthusiasm to care for the socially disadvantaged in Baltimore.  I’ve also worked with other doctors and nurses with similar values during my volunteer work at the University of Maryland Medical Center. These healthcare workers have inspired me to acquire the knowledge and skill to do such heroic and lifesaving work. However, my biggest role model in my life and career has always been my father. My father has worked in Baltimore as a surgeon for many years and has often discussed his work with me and introduced me to opportunities there. I was able to experience intense emergency medicine through my time volunteering for UMMC Shock Trauma, which enthralled me. This team of fast paced medical experts sparked my excitement for a future in healthcare. However, when the dust settled it was what was behind the scenes that sealed the deal for me. It was watching my father run down to the hospital cafeteria in between cases to get one of his hungry patients a sandwich, drive a couple hours across state lines to attend a longstanding patient’s funeral, or sit listening to an older patient explaining her day’s needlework because no one else came to visit her. He did not just love his work, he loved the people he served.  He loved healing people, and because of that, all the sacrifices he made for other people’s lives gave meaning to his career. Through him I learned that in order to navigate human suffering in the medical field we need the compassion, resilience, perseverance, and grit that we bring with us from a variety of real world experiences.
I believe that one of the greatest strengths in a good doctor is compassion because it gives more significance and power to a doctor’s natural inclination to heal people. Compassion is a willingness to suffer with another, even when you cannot do much to help them.  It is a difficult virtue to practice, but it comes through gaining perspective of another's world and wanting to improve their condition by giving of yourself. I have had a chance to cultivate my own compassion by exposure to service projects, and by observing compassionate people around me. Community service was a foundational part of my upbringing and behind all of it has been the instruction that “to whom much is given, much will be required” (Luke 12:48). I am fully aware of the many privileges and opportunities I have been given, especially the education and experiences that have allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the world around me. Many of these have exposed me to an abundance of suffering due to poverty and poor health, and shown me how people can be deprived of many things that make life enjoyable. I have allowed those memories to fuel my ambition for joining the medical field in order to integrate myself into a community of people that serves the suffering. The world may never reach the utopia we all strive to achieve, but I hope to fight for a healthier world one patient at a time, using compassion and hard work to alleviate some of the pain of those around me.","I truly believe that our strength is in our diversity. Many different backgrounds and opinions produce a variety of ideas for solving problems. Starting at a young age, I was involved in_x000D_
exchange programs and mission trips, as well as extensive education in Hispanic culture through my undergraduate Spanish minor degree. This exposure to different people has taught me that each individual life track gives rise to different beliefs, and to understand those perspectives we need an open mind and empathetic heart. I have learned that bias and discrimination are often due to lack of understanding of another party and a need for education and compassion. Making connections with many kinds of people is something I have always liked, and I will bring this accepting, open-minded attitude with me to Rush Medical College. I would like to be part of an educational community where practice of these principles is encouraged.","For a volunteer trip to Colombia in 2019 my sisters and I raised money and designed lesson plans for a summer camp to teach disadvantaged kids swimming and English.

I hadn’t slept yet - the NCAA hadn’t allotted us the time - as just four hours ago my position with University of Michigan softball had ended on a field in Seattle, two thousand miles from home. I looked to my right and saw our head coach, Carol Hutchins, engaged in a discussion over the game-to-flight turnaround time with the NCAA representative, still fighting for her student athletes' rights, the same way she fought to uphold Title IX over forty years ago. Female leaders and advocates for women’s equity on the playing field, much like Carol Hutchins, surrounded me during my sixteen years as an athlete. It is because of their guidance that I too became a leader and grew passionate for female equity. Though I had spent a majority of my life surrounded by strong female leaders, I was ignorant of how much I wanted these skills I had amassed from years as part of the athletic community to transfer into a future career as a physician. When I assumed the most direct role a person can have with a physician, as the patient, I witnessed firsthand the disproportionate amount of urban and underserved women plagued by chronic conditions and instantly felt pulled to serve, empower, and educate them.

My passion for medicine and working with urban, underserved female populations solidified when, in the summer of 2019, I woke up in a body I no longer recognized or felt at home in. I quickly grew accustomed to spending the better part of my time in and out of physician’s offices, fearful yet intrigued by the physiology of the disease that had come to plague my body. While a firm diagnosis is still on the way, I was eventually tentatively diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and my health has been well-controlled for over a year. Through this frightening time, I found solace in the dedication that my physician allotted to me and my care. She often stayed long over the allotted time to address all of my concerns and sketched complex physiological pathways for me to follow after she learned of my desire to become a physician. During the most medically difficult period in my life, my physician showed me compassion and dedication while delivering a patient-specific education to guide me through. In the midst of my first flare, I became inquisitive about both the physiology and the statistics behind autoimmune diseases. I realized that like my Hispanic mother, aunts, and great-grandmother before me, I had developed an autoimmune disease. I was unnerved at the number of Hispanic and other minority women, often in urban areas, who develop and struggle with autoimmune diseases and other chronic conditions. My experiences with my family’s health struggles and my passion for increasing female equity in athletics combined to bring to light a need to empower and provide women with compassionate, patient-centered care and an engaging medical education as a physician. In recognizing the intersection of women’s equity in athletics and healthcare, I sought out clinical experiences that would allow me to interact daily with underserved female populations.

When my feet once again found solid ground, I immediately sought out opportunities to engage directly with female populations and further advocate for patients in their healthcare experience. In the fall of 2022, I began working as a clinical research assistant testing the effects of a novel device on chronic stroke recovery. My favorite participant, “Ela,” was an older minority woman who, like most of our participants, had long run out of insurance-backed physical therapy and now relied on our sessions as her sole form of medical intervention. When Ela first began, I recognized that she was timid, didn’t believe in her capacity for improvement, and did not understand her diagnosis. I spent our sessions explaining how we hoped the device would help Ela and the specifics of her condition that had claimed the use of half of her body. I also listened to Ela and suggested various ways for her to incorporate her arm into everyday use through her favorite activity, cooking. By the end of our time together, Ela had improved greatly, and would often show up to our sessions with new ideas to try and newfound hope for her improvement. Though I loved the time I spent with Ela, I always wished that I had gotten to be there from the beginning, to have a more direct role in her diagnosis and care–as her physician.

My experience as a clinical research assistant confirmed what my experiences in athletics and my own disease had set in motion. From being raised as a leader and advocate for women’s equity on the playing field to experiencing a chronic disease that disproportionately affects women, I know that my passion for educating and advocating for women must combine into a career as a physician in underserved women’s health. Just as my physician dedicated herself to ensuring my well-being, and as head coach Carol Hutchins has fought for the advancement of women in sports, I hope to dedicate myself to my patients through advocating, empowering, and educating them to find their voice in their healthcare experience.","When my participant was quieter than usual, I chalked it up to fatigue until we discussed his commute. He explained that he almost had an accident on the PACE bus and barely made it to the bathroom due to an abnormal three-hour commute. Many participants share that they cannot eat before commuting due to uncertainty about when they‚Äôll next be able to use a bathroom, are often bypassed by several full buses, and struggle to find ride-share drivers willing to assist them. Working with patients with physical disabilities has taught me about insufficient access to a city that we should all be able to explore freely. After learning of our participants' struggles, I began offering snacks to supplement their apprehension about eating and became more flexible in scheduling appointments. Working with individuals with disabilities has broadened my worldview on the accessibility of urban centers and taught me the importance of communication and accommodation when working with diverse populations.","Educational inequities are an important determinant of health that I have always been drawn to dismantle due to education‚Äôs profound ability to forever change the course of our lives. For the past year, I have tutored two west side students through Tutoring Chicago, and have recently been selected for a leadership position in the organization. When I first started tutoring ‚ÄúMaria,‚Äù she read below her grade level and disliked school because of how behind she felt compared to her friends. By the end of the year, Maria had earned all A‚Äôs & B‚Äôs, improved significantly in academic vocabulary, and began to enjoy attending school again. Volunteering as a tutor and associate board member for Tutoring Chicago has allowed me to impact Chicago students facing economic barriers. Though I hope to accomplish more in improving societal and structural determinants of health as a student at Rush Medical College, I hope to have played a small role in improving educational access for Chicago communities.",,,1,"When the remainder of the B1G athletics season was canceled in 2020, I temporarily lost my job with the Michigan Softball program. When the loss of my position led to difficulty in supporting myself at school, I moved home to reduce expenses while utilizing savings as needed. I hoped to spend the summer gaining clinical experience and shadowing physicians, but when those experiences became unavailable I had to find ways to adapt my path to medical school. With little possibility of gaining clinical experience, I focused on my schoolwork and sought out clinical and shadowing experiences as they became available. The biggest change was moving away from my physician in the midst of my diagnostic journey. It was sad to place an indefinite pause on my diagnosis, but moving home allotted me time to develop healthy coping strategies. The pandemic also led to my most important volunteering activity, Tutoring Chicago, which has since become a large part of my life and journey to medical school.",1,0,1

It was an unexpected decision for a controversial crime. I saw the ugly side of the story and watched my family get torn apart. The experience opened my eyes to the heartbreaking reality of the world in which we live, where injustice is an ever-present threat, and the punishment does not always fit the crime. As an aspiring physician, I have become aware that there is injustice in healthcare as well, and it comes in the form of health disparities afflicting underserved populations. I have committed myself to becoming a doctor who prioritizes awareness of self and others, one who makes equity of care an essential part of the patient experience. 

At the time of my grandfather’s arrest, I was deciding where to go to college and what to do with my life. My parents were pushing me toward law, perhaps due to what my grandfather had been through, but this career was of no interest to me. I did not want to be in a position to judge or punish people for their behavior; rather, I wanted to provide support in challenging times. I knew I wanted to be a doctor because I viewed it as a career where I could explore my scientific interests while providing care for the whole person, irrespective of past actions. Over the past six years, I’ve come to realize how important it is to be patient-centered and how a personalized approach is a critical part of the healthcare process. As a result, I’ve embraced the more significant role of a physician—to be the bridge that connects diverse communities to care in a way that embraces the life story of each individual.

All the experiences I have had throughout my undergraduate years and beyond have prepared me to work with a wide variety of populations with ever-changing needs. In an effort to engage with the Baltimore community, I have spent my free time volunteering. I mentored a fifteen-year-old boy to help him graduate high school. Despite his abilities, he struggled because he did not have time for school due to his family needing the additional income from his job. I also tutored incarcerated women in basic math and science to help them earn their GED. During our sessions, I quickly learned how most of the women I worked with had never completed middle school, yet they were motivated to take the next step in their education by any means possible. These experiences brought to life the disparities that I knew existed but had never witnessed first-hand. Preconceived ideas and misconceptions about patients are dangerous roadblocks to designing informed treatment plans. As a physician, I feel I must acknowledge that the interplay between a patient’s health and socioeconomic situation is as critical as assessing their physical condition.

After graduation, I learned more about instances of compromised patient care. I worked on psychiatric neuroimaging studies as a research coordinator. Many of my participants were poor, uneducated, suffer from mental health disorders or addictions, or demonstrate a combination of these factors. One of my participants, Andre, was homeless and frequently participated in research studies for money. I was warned that he was not trustworthy about his medical history. When I addressed a discrepancy with him in his medical accounts, he confessed that he had lied to ensure his eligibility. Hearing this, I was disappointed that I had allowed biases to influence my judgment of him. As a result, I started to provide more information about alternative options for study participation for Andre as well as future participants. I found that people were more willing to share their medical history and ask questions about procedural details because they felt like they had a part in the decision-making process. This has taught me to approach my participants as equal partners rather than as a superior. It is imperative for me to show them dignity and compassion and share all the information they need to be empowered to make their own health decisions. 

Today, my grandfather is a convict. Everything he has accomplished has now been overshadowed by his classification as a criminal. Just as preconceived notions overshadow how he is viewed and treated, biased opinions can make equitable care impossible. Together, my experiences have shown me the importance of treating the entire person. If a physician misdiagnoses or creates a treatment plan based on assumptions, it can be dangerous and even life-threatening. That patient’s life, as my grandfather’s, would never be the same. I take with me the lessons learned from volunteering with underserved communities and prioritize connecting with my patients on a personal level. I now access my life experience with my grandfather as a significant factor in helping me become a more compassionate and empathetic physician. Although I initially made the effort to disconnect his experience with my chosen career, I now embrace every life experience as one that can make me a better human being and a physician on which my patients can depend.","Growing up in a Mexican-American family, I saw my Guelita struggle to receive proper medical care due to her inability to speak English. Witnessing this gap in care made me aware that social determinants have an impact on the quality of care that people receive. Consequently, I began to value my multifaceted identity and came to trust in the significance of my diversity in medicine. I also made a commitment to respect the identity of others._x000D_
_x000D_
My Guelita‚Äôs experiences taught me that language or culture often limits the patient-doctor relationships and becomes a barrier to care. To provide equitable care, we as physicians must be aware of the impact social determinants can have on health disparities and become active leaders in public health initiatives. My identity, experiences, and future medical training will enable me to advocate for all community members to provide inclusive, equitable care. I hope to bridge the gaps in cultures and communities to give underserved patients a voice.","I mentor a 15-year-old boy named James from a disadvantaged neighborhood in Baltimore as part of Thread, a volunteer program. James struggled in school and would often skip his required after-school tutoring sessions. His teacher alerted Thread that his absences put him at risk of being put on academic probation. However, James worked a job after school and had been picking up extra shifts to help support him and his family. Recognizing this, I mediated a conversation between James and his school to arrange for James to complete his tutoring sessions before school instead of after. More importantly, I helped James better advocate for himself and form communication channels with his teachers. This created an avenue of trust between us that I cherish. I hope to continue to help him in his life journey and help break the cycle of poverty. Even more, I will continue to seek out uncomfortable social situations outside my norm to build self-awareness and understanding of those unlike myself.",,,1,"As I packed my bags to go home for Spring break, the last thing I expected was to live with my parents for the next six months. My new life at home was stressful. My father was a clinical pharmacist working on a COVID floor, while my mother was put on indefinite leave without pay. Like the rest of the world, we had to pivot. _x000D_
_x000D_
The pandemic disrupted my life but allowed me time to step back and evaluate my priorities. I recognized that I was not passionate about working in a lab but I enjoyed clinical research. I found a new interest in immunology, which inspired me to get my Masters in Health Science. It also helped me recognize my privilege - my family was healthy, we were not in financial danger, and we had access to essential resources. As a result, I volunteered to check in on patients and continued mentor to my high-school student. I learned to consider each patient's unique needs and listen intently. As a physician, I must take an individualized approach to provide the best care.",1,0,2

We were seated in a circle at Walton Family Health Center in the Bronx where I was leading a discussion about prenatal nutrition. The women smiled with familiarity at Lydia’s suggestion that the traditional Caribbean dish of stewed greens could help prevent anemia during pregnancy. Their shared Afro-Caribbean heritage proved more meaningful, and ultimately helpful, than the generic nutrition suggestions on the handouts in front of us. That summer, while working at a clinic that treated mainly Black and Latinx patients, I began to understand the importance of providing care that is culturally competent and patient-centered. At the health center, I was inspired by the physicians who had dedicated their careers to caring for groups traditionally underserved by the medical system. By providing care that was accessible – culturally, financially, geographically – and compassionate, the physicians were playing a part in addressing the stark health outcome disparities for women of color in the U.S. I hope to follow in the steps of these mentors by providing quality care to historically neglected populations. 
My time at Walton showed me the possibilities and limits of clinical care. I could offer women a prescription for a breast pump or a voucher for transportation to the clinic, but I wasn’t addressing the root of these challenges. So, I joined the Project Respect team at Boston Medical Center, where I am leading a research project examining racial disparities in women’s addiction treatment. As I began conducting interviews with women of color about the obstacles they face to receiving care, I was nervous about my ability to connect with them. Traveling to methadone clinics every morning or fearing they may face legal consequences for their addiction if they seek care, these women face many hardships. I found that by validating their struggles, celebrating their strengths, and most of all, listening without judgment, I could create a confidential and safe space despite our deep differences. I was privileged to have the opportunity to create these intimate one-on-one environments for women to share vulnerable reflections. I want to be a physician so I can continue to receive patients’ stories.
Sometimes, a patient’s medical condition creates new priorities. I witnessed the power of honoring each patient’s unique set of priorities during my time at Entre Familia (EF), a bicultural residential treatment program for mothers with substance use disorders. At EF, I facilitated support groups for expecting or new mothers. However, the residents at EF didn’t have the same concerns as the patients at Walton. Questions about breastfeeding were superseded by questions about their baby’s withdrawal or caring for their mental health while in recovery. By shaping our sessions to reflect these priorities, I found myself forming stronger connections with the residents. Truly caring for an individual requires understanding how their conditions may create nuances in their needs and goals. At both EF and Project Respect, I have learned that patient-centered care starts with creating space for patients to vocalize their stories. Carrying these lessons with me, I am equipped to continue building relationships with individuals from misunderstood and underserved communities, helping them achieve their unique goals and ultimately making my practice a more welcoming space for all.
My relationships with patients sparked my initial interest in medicine. But my research experience showed me the power of physicians as advocates and solidified my decision to pursue medical school. At Project Respect, I worked with Dr. Kelley Saia to publish a case report documenting a patient’s delayed metabolism of illicit fentanyl, the misinterpretation of the presumptive positive urine tests by the child welfare system, and the necessity of clinical advocacy to prevent unjust legal separation of the mom and baby. Physician advocates utilize our report in the drug court system to prevent similar familial injustices from occurring. While individual patient relationships can go a long way toward ending health inequities, the underlying causes of inequitable care lie at the structural and institutional level. The most effective way to create lasting change is through research-informed policy and advocacy. For example, building upon the case report, further studies may lead to reform of the local child welfare system’s policy regarding fentanyl screenings. I am motivated to continue conducting this kind of research, creating lasting impact.
I enjoy learning about and attending to every patient’s unique experience. The journeys of women from the Bronx to Boston, from community health centers to recovery homes have shown me the pressing need for health equity efforts. But my experiences have also given me hope in the ability of medical professionals to respond to this need. I am eager to use my career as a physician to provide equitable, patient-centered clinical care and to transform patient stories into research and policy that reflect the genuine, complex lives of the people I aim to serve.","It‚Äôs 6:30 on Wednesday morning during my sophomore year at Barnard. I leave my dorm and hop on the M60 bus. Two bus transfers and ninety minutes later, I arrive at Rikers Island Correctional Facility, the city‚Äôs largest jail, to provide in-classroom academic support to their students. Each week, students shared their individual goals. Some were focused on the assignment at hand, others talked of passing the Regents exam so they could get a job once they were out. Centering each session around their unique goals, I connected with my students and uncovered insight into their lives. One student shared that he grew up down the street from Barnard. Another had plans to become a businessman. In order to truly understand their goals, I couldn‚Äôt rely on my own experiences and expectations but had to create space for the students to share theirs. I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to connect with the students at Rikers and the chance to engage across the many boundaries that divide us.","Despite the proven benefits for mom and baby, there are disparities in rates of breastfeeding between Black and white communities. As an Americorps volunteer at Boston Medical Center, I collaborated with community leaders to increase access to breastfeeding support in underserved neighborhoods like Dorchester, Roxbury, and Mattapan. Alongside women from the community, I took the course to become a Certified Lactation Counselor. However, instead of providing direct lactation services to patients myself, I created opportunities, like parenting support groups at local libraries, for these women to share breastfeeding knowledge with their peers. Moreover, the lactation trainings I organized served as avenues of professional development for these women, thus increasing economic opportunities. These projects mirror the approach I hope to take as a doctor - to not just treat, but to educate as well - and put knowledge back into the community's hands.",,,1,"Throughout the pandemic, many of our patients at Project Respect struggled to access life saving resources, like in-person recovery groups or accessible psychiatric care. Social isolation and increased demand for social services made a high risk group even more vulnerable. The circumstances of patients at the clinic spurred me to help those around me meet basic needs so I began volunteering with Cambridge Mutual Aid. There, volunteers created carpools for community members to travel to doctor's appointments or childcare collectives for frontline workers. I was impressed by the impact we had when people came together to care for each other and address the gaps left by systemic inaction. This work highlighted the importance of creative solutions, such as weaving community-level interventions with hospital and outpatient care, in addressing the both pandemic and long standing health inequities. As a physician, I aim to find new, bold ways to shift our healthcare system to work for all.",1,0,3

While I had recently begun taking myself more seriously as a student, I had felt somewhat directionless. I had earned my driver’s license, had nearly a year of work experience under my belt, and took on more challenging courses while preparing for college applications. Shortly before my seventeenth birthday, this relatively bump-free life took an unexpected turn when I woke up on the bathroom floor after stepping out of the shower. Following two separate seizures, I was diagnosed with a right temporal astrocytoma that required resection. Though the surgery was successful, I faced the challenge of trying to get my life back to normal. I couldn’t drive; I was not prepared for my AP exams and SAT; and I lost my first job. Receiving cards, calls, and visits reminded me of how far I’d gotten with the help of others. Still feeling two steps behind, being surrounded by care along the way had motivated me to keep moving forward and work harder to take my future head-on. Prior to my surgery, I recently began attending Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu classes after a friend invited me. Despite not knowing of the sport beforehand, I thought I’d try something new and expand my boundaries. Still recovering from surgery and without much experience, I did my best to pick up technique by observing classes. Once I was medically cleared to participate, I found myself struggling to keep up with other students. Each day I returned and asked our instructor what I was doing wrong, and how I could improve my technique; many nights I would remain after classes ended, working one-on-one with her to break down mistakes I was making, continuing our discussions as we washed the mats together. With years of training, failure, and learning, my sensei gave me the opportunity to begin teaching classes to my peers. Doing so had helped me realize how much I had left to learn while allowing me to pass down what I had learned so far to others. I saw newer students making the same mistakes I had, and I felt their frustrations. I asked each student what I could do to support them and help them learn, and geared my teaching toward that. Being able to guide students and observe their improvement drove me to continue to do the best I could. Entering college, I was excited by all the potential learning opportunities, while overwhelmed by needing to pick just one. While my experience as a patient pushed me in the direction of medicine, I had no knowledge of what being a doctor entailed. Unwilling to leave my questions unanswered, I had searched for experiences that would help develop my understanding of medicine. Following the advice of my pediatrician, I got a job as a medical scribe during my studies. As a scribe, I was able to observe the work of doctors across many specialties. I learned the importance of an open mind in medicine—that the propensity for learning is essential to the success of any physician across all areas of medical practice. Whether documenting endoscopies or orthopedic exams, my growing familiarity sparked more questions to ask the physicians with whom I worked. By seeing the everyday lives of physicians in a clinical setting, I was able to affirm my desire to practice while cementing my understanding of what it takes to be a physician. Now working in a clinical research setting, I am able to interact with patients and get to know them on an individual level. On one occasion, I sat down with a patient as she received her chemotherapy infusion, and we spent over an hour telling each other about our lives. She asked me about why I chose to work with cancer patients, then confided in me about how her faith helped her get through her ovarian cancer. Sometimes she questioned whether or not it was worth continuing. I reassured her that she is helping countless other women by allowing us to attempt an alternate treatment regimen. The reason I told her I wanted to work with cancer patients was that I felt a responsibility to further my understanding of medicine to improve the lives of those I had once been in similar shoes as. Many patients like her naturally ask dozens of questions regarding their treatment, of which I do my best to answer or seek answers from those more knowledgeable. In response, I ask patients that I work with to return the favor by informing me of what I can do to better advocate for them and ensure they receive the care they need. Whether wearing a gi and a colored belt or researching different treatment options for gynecologic cancers, I’ve found that there is always room to learn and improve. Much like the medical professionals who helped me at my lowest point, I want to do my best to gather the knowledge and experience necessary to give back to others in need. By being able to document encounters across different areas of medicine, I’ve only realized how much more I have left to learn. Becoming a BJJ coach and diving into the field that allowed me to continue has further encouraged me to develop the skills necessary to ensure others can take on the experiences their health has failed to afford them. For each and every person, my one goal is to do my part to help them live their lives on their own terms","Manuel used the little English he had to ask about my family while making sure I was satisfied with my haircut. At the time, I didn't realize that this is just a taste of everyday reality for millions of people across the country. While lacking Spanish dialogue only made it harder for me to understand him at that moment, lacking English serves as a barrier to many aspects of life I've taken for granted. After leaving their home in the Dominican Republic to provide a better life for their children, Manuel and his family accepted me as one of their own when his daughter and I began our relationship. Since then, I've seen firsthand many of the challenges of being a first-generation immigrant in this country. Without speaking English, they need their children's company for appointments, translating important documents, or even ordering takeout. I had decided that I would begin learning Spanish so I can be one fewer person that makes them struggle with the language barrier.","Working with many patients from disadvantaged backgrounds as a research assistant at Women & Infants, I have taken steps to reduce inequities in our patient population. On one occasion, a patient missed her chemotherapy infusion due to being hospitalized while I was on vacation. Upon returning, I reached out to her to reschedule her treatment. She expressed distress due to the lack of compassion and communication she felt from her providers that, as a black woman, impacted her quality of treatment. I reached out to her oncologist to communicate her concerns, and suggested possible solutions to ensure the patient felt more connected to her treatment. Previously, staff have expressed discontent with the patient missing or being late to appointments, to which I explain her difficulty managing treatment due to raising her two sons alone while her husband is away as a missionary. As a physician, I hope to continue learning from patient experience to better advocate for equality in care.",,,1,"After extending our Spring break by a week, our school soon announced that we would complete the rest of the semester online. As the graph of COVID cases climbed higher each day, my shifts as a scribe were canceled one-by-one as each provider closed its office to in-person encounters. Professors with whom I planned to join their research rescinded their offers, and the organization I planned to volunteer for discontinued all volunteering. As my paychecks shrank each week, I began a new job in a primary care office. As I began my senior year, my job could not accommodate my changed schedule, and I was laid off. Towards the end of my Fall semester, I received the news that my mother was sick. I was not allowed to visit her in the hospital; I soon spoke to her on the phone, hearing her voice for the last time. With COVID now integrated into our everyday lives, I have resolved to catch up on the opportunities I lost at the beginning of the pandemic, and march forward despite its setbacks.",1,0,0

Can you believe it?! So precocious!” Countless times I have heard stories about a young me displaying a fascination with people. This curiosity and love for connecting with others sparked the early development of emotional intelligence – otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ – defined as the capacity to perceive, understand, and manage your own emotions and those of others. My EQ has enhanced my ability, in both personal and professional settings, to adapt my demeanor and responses to create an atmosphere of empathy and trust.

My earliest memory of putting this into action is in high school. As our minds changed along with our bodies, some people developed complex emotions and altered life outlooks. For two close friends, this led to a deep depression they felt would last forever. I strongly empathized and found it natural to engage with them, talking through what was happening and ways to approach their circumstances. While others were uncomfortable in this situation, I found myself saying the right things to put them at ease and be comfortable confiding in me. Looking back, I realize I was an early active listener, which enhanced my appreciation for the complexities behind human emotions, thereby helping me better individualize my support. I became fascinated with what they were experiencing both psychologically and neurologically. This pushed me to research mental health pathologies and care options, which informed my understanding of the disorders, treatments, and advisable language to guide someone towards helpful resources. After encouraging them to talk to their parents and seek professional support – and for one person, even accompanying them to initiate a conversation with our school counselor – I was delighted to see my friends on the path to better managing their mental health. These experiences and their impacts ignited my interest in pursuing a career in medicine.

The first time I applied my EQ in a healthcare context was while leading a rehabilitation program for the BU Aphasia Lab in the summer between my junior and senior year. Tasked with developing the session plans, I did a deep dive researching current treatments of aphasia by reading numerous leading peer-reviewed articles on prior study outcomes and discussing them with the lead investigators. From there I conceptualized, designed, and implemented a program that used mobile technology, music, and mindfulness to aid daily functioning with aphasia. The class attracted patients with a variety of ages and cognitive abilities, some were nonverbal while others engaged in continuous ramble. As many were unable to adequately express themselves, I looked to other signals, such as behavioral reactions and nuances in facial expressions, to assess if they were bored or frustrated by the tasks. I quickly realized that we needed to adjust the sessions to be more personalizable, so we created levels that would allow each patient to choose a starting point and advance at their own pace. As the weeks went on, I was delighted to see their moods improve, observing that they were not only enjoying the exercises, but also benefiting from them. In the final class they each joyously showed off their favorite new skill. From this experience, I learned that standard treatments may not always fit every patient, and that it is important to pay close attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues to help inform personalized care.

In my post-grad jobs I found my EQ strength more valuable than any other clinical skill. At NYU, when assessing a potential study participant’s PTSD symptoms during a phone screening, I looked for changes in their tone while discussing a sensitive topic, and I reflected their feelings, which helped them become more comfortable sharing vulnerable information. In my current role as a medical assistant, before I draw a patient’s blood, I assess their body language as we start discussing the procedure, which allows me to adjust my approach to create a more supportive atmosphere. 

I have found that many people's negative perceptions of healthcare stem from experiences where they did not feel comfortable enough to fully express themselves, or sensed that the severity of their condition was being minimized, or desired more information to understand the full scope of their situation. Whether it is the perception that a psychiatrist is diminishing someone’s trauma or a gynecologist is normalizing severe menstrual pain, this is a narrative that hinders care across specialties even with the most well-intentioned doctors. I aim to be a physician who uses a holistic approach to understand patients’ physical circumstances, mental health, and overall well-being, and takes into account all this information when making care decisions. By leveraging and sharing my deeply developed emotional intelligence, I believe I could create an atmosphere that instills trust and helps patients feel heard. Ultimately this approach can lead to tangible medical benefits through improved communication and diagnosis, lower stress, and stronger faith in and commitment to treatment plans.","Every spring break in high school, I volunteered with a local church to build houses in Tijuana, Mexico. In just 4 days, a team of 13 students and 2 adults would build a two-room home for a multigenerational family, otherwise without reliable housing. This trip took me and my peers out of our daily lives, and it was formative to see how this community lived and to get to know our local family through conversation and stories. I looked forward to this trip every year and felt proud to work hard to positively impact their lives. On our last building day, we held a ‚Äúkey ceremony‚Äù to hand over their new home, and I will never forget the parents‚Äô thankful look for their family‚Äôs now safer future. These trips helped me learn how to quickly connect with people from different backgrounds, and made me more aware of those lacking basic needs, such as weather-proof shelter, and access to education and healthcare.","For 2.5 years after graduating from BU, I was a research coordinator for an NYU clinical trial, which served uninsured women suffering with PTSD, often battling symptoms without treatment. To help them receive this much needed free therapy, I assisted in enabling the study to offer transportation at no cost, sick notes for work, and compensation for their time. As their point of contact, I worked closely with each participant throughout the study, from assessing their eligibility, to coordinating and conducting their visits. They would often confide in me about their challenges and how they used the study‚Äôs treatment tools in their daily lives. This close connection gave me insight into how much their symptoms were improving, and I loved seeing the benefits of empowering them to help themselves. Their visible clinical improvement brought me great joy and will further inspires me to offer treatment to those in need in my career as a physician.",,,1,"When the first COVID-19 lock-down occurred, I was new to being on my own in NYC, far from family and friends, and living with roommates who did not always follow safety guidelines. After only 2 months of working remotely, my position at NYU was deemed ‚Äúessential,‚Äù and quickly I was back in-person full-time, and in close daily contact with coworkers with new and changing PPE protocols. That, plus studying for the MCAT, made this a challenging period. With the world suddenly in an unprecedented state, I was concerned I would not get the clinical research experience I had planned for, and considered leaving my job to quarantine with my family. After seeing frontline hospital workers relentlessly fight this life-threatening virus, I decided to stay and tackle the opportunity to get IRB approval for adjusted COVID-safe procedures and to enable remote visits.

Each time I compete, adrenaline and nerves take over my body. With one wrong move, my ability to compete as a gymnast was cut short. Sitting in cold plastic chairs, my mother and I waited for my X-rays to return. It had been eight months of pain, a dozen doctor's appointments, and many failed attempts to be the athlete I once was. Finally, my physician knocked on the door, came in with a bright smile, and said, ""I have an answer."" He looked me in the eyes and said, ""You have a fracture in your L5 vertebrae."" Instantly, a million thoughts ransacked my mind. No matter the diagnosis, a weight was lifted from my shoulders. I finally had an answer. As a fourteen-year-old, what seemed like a lifetime of uncertainty finally had a label. My mom's sweaty hand grabbed mine and tears began streaming down my face. My physician fulfilled a need for an answer, a need for hope, and I want to extend that to my future patients. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to immerse myself in the world of medicine. I spent my days at a free clinic in my hometown. During my first week, I sat in on a call for patients with diabetes as they discussed the cheapest treatment options. The call consisted of six patients, one nurse, a translator, and myself, a young Latina. Exposure to significant barriers to care for Hispanic and other underrepresented patients in the medical field has since pushed me to explore how to address these barriers as a Hispanic physician. During my time at The Free Clinics, there were scarce providers with Hispanic backgrounds and numerous encounters requiring online translators. These cultural barriers pushed me to extend my studies into obtaining an EMT-Basic license, basic life support certifications, and taking Spanish courses that enable me to spread compassion and communicate with those less served in my community. 

Through Spanish immersion courses and service-based learning, I have explored ways that the absence of healthcare can affect everyday lives. The echoing laughter of children radiated in the Boys and Girls Club hallway, ""Esperanza"" approached me hopefully and said, ""My parents do not speak English, will you help me?"" Two hours of reading and math homework passed, and we began talking about some of her favorite foods and activities. Casually switching between English and basic Spanish, we discussed her life in America versus Guatemala. I asked if her parents ever cooked dinner at home, and she responded, ""We don't have the money."" I quickly realized from our conversation that she had never been taught nutrition. These unknowns may be translated into harmful effects on her health as she grows up. I want to be the bridge between underserved patients and knowledge of their own health. 

My time spent training for my EMT certification solidified my passion for extending compassion and hope to patients even in the case of no care. Walking through the halls of the emergency department, the intercom announced ""pediatric car accident in five minutes."" My classmates and I, as prospective EMTs, could only stand outside of the trauma bay and watch. Once the young girl was stable, my nurse came up to our group and said, ""I need two females to come in and assist."" Without hesitation, I followed her through the packed halls of the ED. We walked into the room full of bloody rags. I calmly approached the seventeen-year-old Hispanic girl, looked into her watery eyes, and introduced myself. Our eyes locked, she reminded me of a younger version of myself, helpless and scared of her outcome. 

I walked to the head of her bed and told her that I would hold her head and try to ease her pain as we changed out the C-Collar. Halfway through the change, she started crying. I asked her if I needed to reposition my hands. She looked at me and shakily said, ""I have a daughter at home."" For the next five minutes, we talked about her daughter and how she was on the way to pick up ice cream for them when she got into the accident. I had just stood and watched surgeons and residents work on this young lady, and I was getting the opportunity to reassure her in a moment of need. In just five minutes, this girl changed from a set of vitals to a person with a story and medicine gained an emotional meaning. I am motivated by emotional patient connections and unwavering support of patients to become a physician.

Through my personal and clinical experiences, I have learned how physicians can make life-changing impacts on patients. As a patient myself, I experienced days of hopelessness outside of the clinic. I want to provide my patients with the same knowledge, hope, and compassion that I received. I am drawn to becoming a physician, specifically, because I want to be the voice of hope and the bridge between meaningful connections and social change for individual patients, one patient at a time. When I become a physician, I will think of my fourteen-year-old self looking for an answer, of Esperanza who needed to learn how to take care of her body, and of the seventeen-year-old girl scared for her family's future. I will provide my patients with compassion, guidance, and I will make them feel heard.","Once in the facility, I asked a few people to help us slide our 400-pound patient to his bed. After some time, my partner and I decided we would have to move him over on our own. My patient began to tear up. He explained that as an overweight, African American member of the LGBTQIA+ community, he had experienced this treatment before. We assured him and provided him with our best care. Once comfortable in bed, I went and talked to a different member of the staff and made sure that he would be adequately looked after. My partner and I had no scheduled calls, so we stayed for a few minutes to ensure safety and talk with him about his art pieces in the window. This transport showed me that forms of unjust treatment show through in many ways, whether it occurs due to skin color, weight, gender identity, sexual orientation, or a variety of other reasons. Making this patient feel safe and heard was important. This has made me more aware of the support that I will provide to my patients.","During my junior and senior years, there were two Hispanics on the North Carolina State cheerleading team, including myself. Sometimes we experienced bias taking place in minuscule ways, like taking group pictures. We were often separated in group pictures because we looked too much alike. However, these small actions have a major impact when group pictures are used as the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the program. These environments are often filled with unintentional ostracism. During the pandemic, when many social justice issues were being tackled globally, a group of minorities on my team decided to start a diversity and inclusion committee to educate our teammates. We led discussions and tried to include groups outside of our own in-groups, such as lessons about deaf and homeless community opportunities. Unintentional discrimination can be present in many different ways, so being able to educate my fellow teammates was beneficial in gaining respect and some level of understanding for each other.",,,1,"Personally, I went through a lot of battles with spending time with family while at my university. As a student-athlete, I was exposed to around 50 people each practice. While I had more time to spend with family since many things were canceled, I was often scared to go home since much of my family is at high risk. Spending time away from my family during this scary time period was difficult._x000D_
_x000D_
However, COVID-19 opened a lot of doors to explore what I wanted to do. I began volunteering at a free clinic and was able to see the way that COVID-19 affected people of all backgrounds. This showed me that I could make a meaningful impact locally in my community in a time of need. I found a true love for serving the underserved. Working with many people who were at high risk showed me that chronic diseases are much more prevalent in these underserved communities. Working in these communities showed me a side of medicine I had never seen. COVID-19 solidified my desire to apply to medical school.",1,1,2

I am usually the one who notices when someone speaks but isn’t heard. Born and raised in the US as the first child of Nigerian parents, I juggled two cultures. From my summer visits to Nigeria, I saw the remnants of a time during which food on the table was prioritized over empathy. My mother and father were born during the deadly 1960’s Biafra War, which I believe encouraged a lifestyle of “tough love”. This reality about my parents forced me to develop skills early on to navigate the rising tensions in our home. In the heat of arguments between my parents, I would translate their perspectives so they would understand each other, cool down, and resolve the problem. At the time, it felt necessary to play this role because it reduced the temperature in our home, and prevented my younger siblings from crying, and wondering if mom and dad would divorce. 

The skills I developed at home allowed me to recognize my friends’ emotional needs. I’d listen intently and break down the problem in an understandable fashion to them. They’d marvel at my ability to really understand them, but for me, it felt like second nature. Seeing the impact I was having on my friends gave me incredible joy. Unlike at home where applying these skills was a matter of survival, I felt sparks of passion whenever I helped my friends, and I began entertaining the thought that I could help even more people. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “A mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.” I often reflect on this quote because now my mind has expanded, I can no longer “unsee” the emotions people experience. I also cannot prevent myself from wanting to help them. So the next question for me was always - what comes next? As much as I wanted to find immediate answers to these questions, I had to pause my future career search because I faced brand new challenges in high school that I had never faced before.

My parents enrolled me in a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts, a thousand miles away from home, forcing me to exercise independence for the first time in my life. I navigated all the typical and atypical high school experiences alone - from dorm drama to student protests. As the first in my family to go to high school in America, I had no one to guide me in this new environment. At my new school, I struggled with imposter syndrome and I didn’t know how to use my skills to find my place. But after taking time to reflect, I began to notice that the exposure to many cultures and people was teaching me to build connections with those that were different from me. Realizing that I wouldn’t have had the chance to receive this privileged, well-rounded education at home revealed to me the positive side of this experience. 

Motivated, I took all the psychology courses my school offered and asked my teachers to recommend books to read. I then channeled my energy into learning about psychiatry, a more methodical and researched-based approach to understanding people, their motivations, and their mental challenges. At a summer program, I was able to participate in a neurology project studying the effect of SSRIs on memory. I discovered that I was especially passionate about mental health disorders even without knowing exactly which area to focus on.

As I headed off to college, I wanted to find a career that would match my passion. At university, I saw how my friends were put on various medications for diagnosed disorders. The medications improved their quality of life, however, they still confided in me about the very same problems they began medication for. It made me wonder if those medications were indeed addressing the root cause or just suppressing the symptoms. So I researched other forms of treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy and other psychotherapies. It left me wondering if there was a middle ground between medical and holistic treatments for mental health. During my junior year, when my college professor wrote a comment on an assignment that my thoughts embodied cura personalis - a concern for the care of the personal development of the whole person (mind, body, and spirit) - he validated my motivation to pursue the holistic side to mental health as a physician.

I have had many opportunities and learning experiences that have led me to where I am today. Among these is my current position as an intern shadowing clinical psychiatrists who treat the mental effects of patients struggling with chronic health diseases. I now recognize the relationship between biology and psychology as I watch them bridge the gap between the mind and body. It inspires me and confirms my desire to pursue medicine to ultimately become a psychiatrist. I truly believe this is my calling and I know my medical training will equip me with the tools and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the lives of my patients.","In 2017, I helped organize and lead a medical mission to Liberia. Our goal was to deliver temporary healthcare services to the indigenous people in Ganta. My job was to communicate to the locals about their symptoms. While I don‚Äôt speak any of the native languages, I was still able to interpret their English because of my own cultural background. As a Nigerian American, I‚Äôve spent my whole life repeating my parents‚Äô accented English for American ears. This mission gave me a small yet significant glimpse into a world of patients outside of first-world countries. Culturally aware providers strengthen patient-physician trust, increasing the likelihood of patients visiting clinics. This experience reinforced the importance of treating patients across cultures as well as SES. Living in an intersection of multiple identities, from being American to African, has placed me in a position to think critically about diversity and contribute to the multicultural conversation.","Adiza was a bold and brash high schooler who held unpopular opinions. These would get her into trouble because they made people uncomfortable. I felt the same way but was curious about this Boston-raised basketball champion because I wanted to understand her. Surrounded by Caucasians and heterosexuals as a biracial, bisexual young girl, she shrunk herself to fit their standards. She confided in me after I attempted friendship when no one else did. She had been hiding her sexuality for years, living in a culture where it wasn‚Äôt okay to be gay. She told me she felt seen by me because I welcomed her to our dorm. I also asked her questions about where she got her opinions from and how others had treated her. Slowly, she stopped spouting offensive opinions. She allowed herself to be loved, which healed the pain she held in her heart. We are still very close and when we reminisce about high school, she never fails to remind me that seeing through her facade changed her for life.",,,1,,1,1,1

They itched and stung. I am twelve years old confused about what is happening to me and overwhelmed by a feeling of dread. My soccer game was quickly forgotten; instead, my parents brought me to the closest hospital. People were talking fast, my mother was distraught, and the waiting room was full of people of different ages—each sicker than the last. After what felt like forever to my adolescent self, I was brought through the double doors to the only vacant bed in a crowded hallway. Surrounded by my parents, the feeling of dread continued to grow. Finally, a physician came over, crouched down to look me in the eye, and said, “Sometimes things can be scary, but we’re going to do everything we can to make you feel better.” Eventually, I was treated, discharged, and allowed to return home with an EpiPen. Although I never learned the physician’s name, his words in the middle of the chaotic emergency department were a defining moment in my journey to medicine. His compassion and communication during this interaction helped me understand the privilege of assisting people when they are most vulnerable. This core memory sparked my passion for medicine and was fueled by my future experiences as an emergency medical technician (EMT).
 
Working as an EMT, my partner and I responded to a pediatric seizure call. We pulled up to the residence to hear, “We’re coming out to the ambulance; it’s a confirmed arrest.” My heart sank as I realized the enormity of the situation. What started as parents concerned for their seizing child quickly escalated to a 10-month-old turning blue and without a pulse. Before my paramedic partner and I were out of the ambulance, we saw a local fireman coming down the stairs with the limp body of the child. My partner and I were spurred into action. Adrenaline pumping, the protocol for a pediatric arrest ran through my head like a mantra—start CPR, attach the pads, and establish the airway. As each step was completed, it felt like ten more took its place. Pulse checks were met with no success. Before long, we’d done all we could in the field. My partner looked at me across the ambulance and said one word: “Drive.” Responding to the nearest hospital, I couldn’t help thinking of the child in the ambulance and the parents left behind at the house. We arrived at the emergency department to be met by a swarm of physicians and other medical staff. All I could think was, ""Please, let it be enough,"" even though I knew it was too late. Not even five minutes later, I lost my first patient.
 
As a patient, I was provided a brief insight into the world of medicine; the act of service, selflessness, and dedication are the foundations of medicine that initially drew me to this profession. As a certified EMT, I was brought full circle: from being the child with the medical emergency to the provider treating the child. I originally became an EMT to pursue the principles I witnessed as a child; however, with the loss of my first patient, I began to recognize the realities of medicine. The highs of realizing you made a positive impact are counteracted by the lows of witnessing a patient deteriorate. When the latter occurs, it is heart-wrenching and revealed to me my inner strength. Returning to work the next day after the pediatric arrest, the first patient of the day was difficult. However, as the day progressed, each call was easier than the last. While my heart still hurt over the lost child, I chose to focus on the positive impact I was making on each patient that day. Although not all the calls were as intense as the pediatric cardiac arrest, I treated each patient with the same focus and care. Knowing I eased someone’s pain when they are most vulnerable makes the challenges seem minute. This experience emphasized that medicine is dynamic, but also fallible. Witnessing the hardships of this profession, my resolve to become a physician and persevere past the challenges to facilitate patients with their needs has only strengthened. My current medical knowledge is limited, and I am restricted in the level of care I can perform at this time. By becoming a physician, I can expand this knowledge and have a greater outreach.
 
My experiences–from a child having an allergic reaction to an EMT–have cultivated my drive to become a physician. Each of these experiences has instilled in me the knowledge that medicine is multi-faceted and is the culmination of several domains. Instead of focusing on one aspect of care, medicine is where empathy, compassion, science, and health combine to form a field I am dedicated to pursuing.","An adolescent patient identified as transsexual and was self-harming to cope with her emotions. She was in tears as she told me that the kids at her school ignored her request to use her new name. All I could think was, ‚Äúshe is not much younger than my little sister and she is already facing adversity.‚Äù Her mother thanked me at the end of our conversation for treating her child ‚Äúlike a person‚Äù because I used her requested pronouns and name. This comment resonated with me. It was a stark reminder that treating others with dignity and respect is not something everyone has the privilege of experiencing. This experience highlighted that no individual is safe from adversity and it enhanced my desire to fight for patients‚Äô rights whether that be women‚Äôs health, LGTBQIA+, mental health, or basic human rights. I learned that a physician‚Äôs role is multifaceted including understanding these issues and committing their lives to assist their patients on a societal level as well as physical.","I oversaw the implementation of a school supply drive for a local elementary school. The area surrounding Syracuse University has high rates of poverty and homelessness; as a result, students attending the city schools are oftentimes without adequate supplies. We gathered supplies and donated them to the elementary school‚Äôs students. While dropping off the supplies, the students‚Äô faces beamed with happiness. The school supplies relieved a financial strain on the parents of the students and excited the students. This is a small fix to the larger issues of poverty and homelessness, but it at least changed the lives of the students receiving the supplies. I strongly believe that everyone has the right to a solid education regardless of their financial background and I will continue to support similar communities during my time in medical school. I appreciate RMC‚Äôs dedication to improving societal and structural determinants of health and hope to contribute to its commitment.",,,1,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my clinical experiences were delayed. Hospitals in my area were not accepting new volunteers and clinical courses were suspended. Without access to traditional clinical experiences, I instead utilized my time on volunteer work and providing mental health resources to students on campus. During this time, I also explored virtual shadowing to learn about different specialties that I did not have access to. Once certificate programs began to open, I enrolled to become an emergency medical technician. Since the second year of the pandemic, I have worked full-time as a first responder providing direct patient care to help alleviate the additional strain of COVID-19 on the medical system. As a first responder, I learned the toll a pandemic or crisis can have on the medical system and the population it serves. I am honored to have assisted during this time of need and I will utilize the insights I gained to further assist my future patients.",1,0,2

My parents told my siblings and me that we were going to give these children a safe place to live and treat them as members of our family. I remember being filled with emotion during this time. I was angered, thinking about how my own life was going to be affected and how inconvenient it was going to be for me to have random children living in my home. That all changed when I started meeting the kids who showed up at our doorstep. They were coming from places of horrible physical, sexual, and emotional abuse that the average person could not begin to fathom. Whether they were abandoned by their parents or stripped from their arms by the state, these kids were left with nowhere else to turn, arriving at our home with nothing but the clothes on their backs and terrified looks on their faces. It was obvious that they deserved the utmost love and care that our family could provide. I realized how selfish I had been, thinking of my personal problems; these children were losing everything they knew and were urgently being placed into a foster home with complete strangers. While sharing a home with these children, my compassion increased as my eyes were opened to the magnitude of suffering in my own community. This realization inspired me to pursue a profession focused on providing relief from that suffering.
	Throughout high school, my family continued caring for foster children. I found time to balance my academics with helping at home and watching my foster siblings, so that my parents could get a break. For over a year, my family fostered a young boy named Isaiah. He was on the autism spectrum and had suffered from years of neglect and abuse, being shuffled from one foster home to another. While there could be good times with him, there were many difficult times as well. I had to face the frustrations that came with having a foster brother with a myriad of diagnoses and challenging behaviors; however, no matter how many times he was dysregulated and screaming at me or throwing things, I knew that if I stayed calm and comforting, Isaiah’s tantrums would cease, if even temporarily. After seeing him in crisis, there was an overwhelming sense of peace that I felt when I was able to help him regulate and acquire self-control. It was during these interactions that I decided I would strive to bring peace to those suffering during their bleakest times.
	I struggled for a long time trying to decide which professional direction I would take in my life. I considered many different professions with an emphasis on helping others, but my focus was switched to medicine during my first week of college. I met with a Twin Cities emergency department physician, who told me of his daily responsibility to care for patients during the most stressful and traumatic situations of their lives. He told me how he was able to calm these patients and treat them, so that they could move on with their lives or receive further care. Although I had no intentions of becoming a physician before that conversation, my eyes were opened that day to the possibility of serving people through medicine. I changed my major to Biology the next day.
	While progressing through college and my pre-medicine courses, I frequently revisited and grew excited about the prospect of emergency medicine. While I knew there was a long road ahead of me before practicing medicine, I wanted to start helping people as soon as possible. I enrolled in an EMT course to begin developing my skills and gain experience in emergency medicine. After receiving my certificate, I was hired as an Emergency Department Technician at United Hospital in Saint Paul, Minnesota. On only my fourth shift of training, a critical patient came in by ambulance and immediately coded. Acting on the instruction of the physician present, I began chest compressions. It was an overwhelmingly powerful and humbling experience knowing that my hands were all that were keeping this woman alive. As I worked, multitudes of medical personnel rushed into the room, working as a fluid team to keep this woman alive. After what seemed like an eternity, we were able to resuscitate the woman. I vividly remember exiting the room with my preceptor, visibly shaking from what I had just experienced, and I felt an immeasurable sense of purpose. I drove home that night in silence, unable to get the thought of that woman out of my head. 
Since becoming an ED Tech nearly four years ago, I have treated all demographics of patients. From stubbed toes to psychiatric evaluations and gunshot wounds, I have seen and experienced the full breadth of emergency medicine. While the outcome for every patient is not always as positive as the woman from that first week of my orientation, I find great pleasure in being there and caring for my patients when they need me most; it is one of the greatest privileges I have been given in life. I am beyond proud of the work I have done to help those who entrust me with their care, and I look forward to continuing to serve them in my future role as a physician.","Growing up in a family that has cared for 61 foster children from diverse backgrounds, as well as working with the varied patient population in an emergency department, I have been exposed to an array of different cultures, races, and socioeconomic statuses. Through my interactions with the diverse patient populations that I have served, I have learned how a one-size-fits-all mentality is not always appropriate for a healthcare setting, and accommodations need to be made to ensure all who seek care feel comfortable. _x000D_
_x000D_
I have spent thousands of hours in community with people from a large variety of backgrounds, which has helped teach me the unique beauty and struggles that arise with each of these different cultures. The knowledge I have gained through these personal interactions has helped outfit me to treat every person I encounter in a respectful and considerate way and to help lead them on a path to recovery and growth.","As an Emergency Department Technician at United Hospital in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota, I have impacted the community by helping save the lives of patients since 2018. An emergency department is a necessary part of any urban area due to a lack of resources available to a large portion of its residents and those of the neighboring communities. I have been on the forefront of helping people gain treatment for their ailments by being a part of a selfless medical team who has dedicated our lives to caring for others. Whether it has been administering treatment to a patient suffering from an asthma attack, cardiac arrest, or mental health crisis, I am ready to do what is necessary to help anybody who comes into my hospital get the care they need to help them down a path of recovery.

It was Empowerment Day at Camp Kesem, an organization that hosts free summer camps for kids whose parents have cancer. This is the day that campers share their personal stories. These stories were the only thing that mattered at that moment. As I listened to each story, I was moved that this small community created a moment so intimate. Through this, I gained a greater appreciation for deeper connection and understanding, something I will carry as I work with future patients and has since further ignited my passion for medicine. To further explore my pull toward this field, I joined MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) as a research intern.

At MDACC, I investigated how TTI-101, a drug in clinical trials, impacts mutated cancer cells. Due to the nature of the project, I began investigating the captivating intersection of scientific research with clinical medicine. No matter who I found myself conversing with, each interaction cultivated impactful relationships with my peers and mentors. These bonds highlighted the inspiring dedication required to our work and only strengthened my resolve to serve others through medicine. The persistence to overcome challenges is a mindset I have shaped through this experience and something that motivates me in all facets of life. I left MDACC with excitement for the future of medicine and a newfound importance of relationships between the lab and the clinic and how life-changing they can be. As stimulating as this experience was, I could not shake the feeling that my true passion lies in direct patient care.

As a healthcare technician (HCT) on the surgical floor of a hospital, I discovered what I was missing at MDACC. In the hallway, I saw the startled face of “Anne,” the wife of a patient currently in liver failure. Panicked, she asked if she could talk to me privately. Anne shared the worry she had about her husband's prognosis for recovery. She even disclosed her apprehension about asking questions, for fear of not being able to understand the answers. I sat there for a second as I witnessed worry intertwine with the tears in her eyes as she hoped for answers. It was evident that I was in no place to give medical advice or ensure her husband’s well-being; however, I provided what I could, an ear to listen and compassion for her situation. Anne left the room more relaxed as I stayed behind contemplating. I was conflicted, while trying to envision how I would have approached and educated Anne if I had the tools necessary. I was grateful to have given her some peace of mind, but I knew that was only temporary. I could not provide what she wanted most, transparency on the situation. This interaction emphasized that the high demand for physicians often stretches them to their limits. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than to help alleviate that limitation by playing a larger role in my patient's care and relieve Anne’s worry by offering the medical knowledge she desired.

Anne’s encounter was very reminiscent of my experiences at Camp Kesem. Although I have never had a parent diagnosed with cancer, I can only imagine the overwhelming emotions that come about when openly talking about it. I am very fortunate and thankful to have given this special population of children the opportunity to tell their stories for three years. Even though I knew that behind all their laughs, jokes, and smiles, their main worry remained: their parents' health. Regardless, the resiliency exhibited by these campers has inspired my pursuit to be a physician. Reflecting on my experience with Anne and the campers, I am eager to continue cultivating communities as a physician where I can share more of these transformative moments with patients and loved ones alike.

Over the years, I have come to highly value communication and its importance in fostering and growing relationships. Just as I have done through my collaborations at MDACC and interactions with patients and their loved ones as an HCT, I am eager to learn from the experiences and views of fellow medical students and faculty alike on my mission to become a compassionate physician and colleague. Likewise, I am eager to use my experiences in patient care, research, and leadership roles, to form an inclusive and welcoming environment. Such that my future classmates, myself included, can feel comfortable challenging themselves not only in subject matter, but personal development.

My time at MDACC only reinforced the stance that research is indispensable. While I am grateful for everything I have learned while there, the true heart and soul of medicine rests in care. Being able to do that as an HCT is something that has brought me so much joy, yet a desire to do more. Lifelong learning is an important aspect of this vocation, but the devotion physicians show to their patients and community gives me further excitement for a career in medicine. Knowing that a physician's role extends beyond physical healing inspires me. In my view, there is nothing more vulnerable or open than the patient-physician relationship. I am looking forward to the day when I can serve patients with devotion to their stories and be a catalyst in guiding them to remarkable lives.","Throughout college, I enjoyed being a part of ‚ÄúCelebra Floreciente‚Äù, a day of celebration that promotes Mexican cultural heritage and empowerment of the local Latino community. Speaking with individuals from the Floreciente neighborhood, I learned more about their passions, values, and hardships. Some of the individuals I met have insecurities in many aspects of life whether it be economic, educational, or cultural. Despite their challenges, they manage to keep a positive mindset. This is an attitude that I greatly admire and something I try to apply in my daily life. From interactions like these, I have learned to appreciate and value the opportunity to listen and have conversations with those whose experiences differ from mine. I believe that instead of viewing cultures as distinct and incompatible from our own, we should view them as an opportunity for growth and to broaden our knowledge of the world. At the end of the day, I endeavor to be a supporter and advocate for all.","One of the positions I held during my time with Camp Kesem was outreach coordinator. This organization provides free summer camps for kids whose parents are affected by cancer. Many of the children that I have had the privilege of working with come from complicated and under-resourced backgrounds. Although the camp is free, campers must still bring their own clothes and camping gear. I have realized that certain families do not have the resources to bring the required items to camp. I encouraged my chapter to set aside money fundraised throughout the year so that we could supply those resources for families if need be. As an outreach coordinator, I wanted to ensure that camp necessities were not a barrier for their children to attend camp. I truly believe that anyone who wants to experience Camp Kesem should be able to. No matter my role in the organization, working with these campers has driven me to ensure that each family feels a sense of belonging to the Camp Kesem community.",,,1,"Like many others during this time, leaving campus to continue classes online at home was a time of transition. While I did lose two jobs that I used to help pay school fees, I used the time that I would normally be at work to gain a better understanding of the material. Personally, my grandfather was placed in a nursing home in May of 2020, leaving my grandmother alone in their house. I spent extra time at their house to help with household maintenance and to give my grandmother some company in a time of isolation. While my original internship opportunity for the summer of 2020 was canceled, I was instead able to connect with Baylor College of Medicine to participate in a virtual summer lecture series from June to August. I am very appreciative of this experience because it not only provided a much-needed opportunity to converse with other students and faculty, but it allowed me a chance to stay involved and further my knowledge about some of the latest news in medicine and research.",1,0,2

Fast forward to undergrad, I rolled out of bed on a Sunday morning, ready for a routine 7am shift on the ICU floor at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. I saw a commotion in a patient room, home to a 35-year-old man who I played cards with just a few days prior. He was stable overnight but deteriorated quickly, forcing surgeons to attempt life-saving measures in the ICU. It was too late; they were unable to save him from a fatal sepsis infection. I asked a nurse what caused this, and she replied with a familiar phrase: “diverticulitis.” In this full circle moment, I knew my career path was in the field of medicine.

From learning medical terms at the dinner table and begging my dad to bring in a human brain for show-and-tell, to now working directly with patients undergoing chemotherapy infusions, I have always been intrigued with the world of healthcare. I love the vast knowledge and challenging concepts medicine provides - yet I realize it is not simply about science. It is about the patients and their loved ones, the providers and their support crew, and the empathy, communication, and teamwork necessary to be part of a healthcare team.

As a UCLA hospital volunteer, I often interacted with patients from a non-medical perspective. I was the link between the distant outside world and the harsh medical one. I sat with sick and struggling patients, listened to their stories, and provided a moment of meaningful humanity during a truly difficult time. I talked for hours with “George,” a friendly older gentleman who had undergone a CABG with complications. He told me about his travels to Europe and his Tuesday golf adventures with friends. One day, George excitedly told me his grandchildren were visiting and asked if I would help him get ready to ensure he did not look “old and sickly.” I helped George look his best, and that brief moment of my time meant the world to him. The connections I built with patients while volunteering showed me to value humanity amidst professionalism. Compassion and empathy are character traits of utmost importance to me; my experiences have taught me to understand others’ personal struggles while providing needed support.

While earning my bachelor’s degree at UCLA, I was a member of the Division I women’s rowing team. Rowing in a boat of eight rowers, led by one coxswain, helped me master the skill of working in sync with others, while simultaneously maintaining technical precision and pushing my body to its absolute limits. In an environment of controlled chaos, with unpredictable outside forces, my teammates and I worked together to reach our goals. We relied on one another, trusting we would remain focused individually while overcoming every hurdle collectively. I faced many challenges as a Division I athlete, but with inordinate personal strength, resilience, and dedication - and an even greater commitment to my team - I thrived in this dichotomy of individual success and sacrifice. My rowing experiences translate directly to working with a healthcare team. Every member is essential and success is dependent on fulfilling individual responsibilities and being supported by the rest of the team. I am confident that when I become a physician, I will flourish and enjoy both the rewards of individual successes and strong collaborative team efforts towards a mutual goal.

While I have put my collegiate athletic career behind me, I remain a strong team player. As a medical scribe at the Stanford Valley Care hematology and oncology clinic, I work closely with physicians, PAs, nurses, and MAs to provide quality patient care. Communication plays an essential role in our team effort. When speaking with patients, I respectfully and caringly discuss medical information with individuals who are often in the midst of a medical crisis. When I draft the written record for each appointment, I observe the physicians moving from room to room, endlessly selfless, kind, and authentic with patients, while also demonstrating punctual and professional habits. I am inspired by the patients’ positive attitudes, despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles. I personally strive each day to provide the best patient care in the face of intellectual pressures. My commitment to my healthcare team and patients is unwavering.

Pursuing a career in medicine presents a challenging opportunity in a profession I find cognitively and personally rewarding. Through my experiences, I established I have the competence, character, confidence, and commitment to embrace this path. Having observed and worked with many admirable individuals within the medical community, I am passionate about continuing to develop my skills of empathy, teamwork, and dedication to healthcare. I strive to challenge myself to learn and grow, while building connections and interweaving humanity with medicine. One day, I hope to challenge my child to pronounce “diverticulitis” at the dinner table, and share my knowledge and experience with a new generation.","In middle school, I had a foreign languages class in which every three weeks was an introduction to a new language and its culture. I became intrigued with Spanish, deciding it was the language I would learn. Ten years later, I graduated from UCLA with a minor in Spanish, further extending my cultural awareness and fluency. During my undergrad, I was constantly immersed in different cultures, meeting others from diverse backgrounds. One of my professors was an indigenous Kichwa woman from Ecuador; her perspective fostered in me a new appreciation for the importance of cognitive diversity. Furthermore, in my travels to Spain, Portugal, and Mexico, I had the opportunity to converse with native speakers and become more comfortable communicating in my second language. I experienced unique foods, asked questions about the countries‚Äô histories, and learned age-old traditions. Studying another language supports an understanding of the relationship between culture and humankind.","My time working as a medical scribe has allowed me to apply my love for helping others, experience unique perspectives from a variety of individuals, and give back to the community. It has also shown me the many hurdles that the world of healthcare must overcome. In my clinic, the shift to Telemedicine has exposed inequities, forcing our clinic to address problems with diligence and patience to provide inclusive care to all patients. One of our patients is a gentleman experiencing homelessness, currently living out of his truck, and is without any access to a smartphone or computer. We arranged for him to come into the clinic and I assisted him with logging onto the video visit from an exam room to ensure quality care despite his circumstances. Factors such as affordability, access, and diversity can greatly influence healthcare. Achieving equitable and inclusive medicine will always be of the utmost importance, and I strive to play a role in addressing this persistent issue.",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic began in March of 2020, like others, I was immediately affected by it. My 100-year-old great aunt tested positive and moved into my family home to be under our care. While serving as a primary caretaker for my aunt, I balanced my academics, tutoring position, training as a DIvision I athlete, and studying for the MCAT, which had been postponed many months. My research I had just begun was canceled and all classes were moved online. Fast forward to today, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an effect on my experiences. Working in a hematology and oncology clinic, the virus is still threatening our immunocompromised patients. After the Omicron surge this past winter, the clinic was forced to convert to all Telemedicine visits for many months to minimize exposures. Although Telemedicine is challenging, I have learned to adapt as necessary, finding ways to provide exceptional care to our patients while also ensuring patient health and safety.",1,0,1

You start to panic as he doesn’t respond to your calls. You look around at your parents crying and your sister holding on to your mom’s hand, and the panic takes over. Tears begin and don’t stop as you yell at your grandfather to answer. While your mother cries in the corner, adults in similarly blue outfits sit you down and try to explain what is happening. 
My grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer when I was six. It was the first time I experienced life in a hospital. I did not understand why people were sticking my grandfather with long needles and would try to fight the nurses for hurting him. While my grandfather was still strong, he would tell me these people were helping him, how they were fairies sent to help him get stronger. I remember the doctor went along with the story, saying these fairies were injecting magic into my grandfather to help him feel better. Though I know now that the magic was medication, I am grateful to that physician for allowing me to stay a child for a little longer. It was the first time I had been directly impacted by a physician and six-year-old me wanted to become a fairy like him to help my grandfather.
Through Circle of Friends club in high school, I became close with an autistic boy named Spencer. He experiences brain aneurysm complications, leading to regular stays at the hospital. One day while visiting Spencer at the hospital, his mother pulled me aside and told me he would be going into surgery later that day. She was calm and unworried, confidently saying that she trusted the surgeon with her child’s life. I wondered how someone could entrust their child’s life to another’s hands, reminding me of my grandfather’s fairy metaphor. I realized I wanted to be that person, that doctor who eases the worries of patients and their families, earning their trust. I became excited to explore a career that would allow me to study the science behind that metaphorical magic I learned about as a child.
My passion was confirmed the following year when my grandmother’s health began to decline. Over the years, her physicians prescribed more and more medications. She went from taking daily vitamins and mild pain killers to taking six different prescriptions for ailments we didn’t even know she had. Soon she began to act differently. She could no longer cook or tend to her garden and was barely able to get out of bed. My grandmother kept telling me she was tired constantly and always in pain, saying the only thing that helped was the medication. We realized later that my grandmother was not communicating effectively with her physicians which contributed to her decline. My turning point for medicine was my grandmother’s health decline and death. I wanted to learn more about illness in the elderly population and health decline in general. I started to pursue medicine more concretely as I took classes related to medicine, becoming a certified medical assistant, as well as looking into colleges with good premed programs. 
When I graduated college, my pursuit continued as I looked for research opportunities involved with health longitudinally in a population. I heard of the Dallas Hearts and Minds Study (DHMS) through a friend at UT Southwestern Medical Center where they investigate the causes and implications of heart disease in a population over time. Once I was interviewed and heard about the work I would do with physicians and professors, the engagement with patient medical records to determine cardiac events, as well as interacting directly with a variety of study participants, I knew this was the perfect fit for me. I have learned the process of how to read and request medical records and how to interact on a professional level with physicians as well as patients. I am continuing to learn skills required for the biomedical field - communication skills, survey applications, adjudication processes, reading medical charts, phlebotomy, and more. I apply these skills in real life with DHMS. My involvement has an even greater impact on my life than I could have imagined. I have created relationships with the participants and physicians around me as well as found heart disease and the analysis of medical charts fascinating. 
I am inspired by the health professionals I work with daily, who are intent on building relationships, on being trusted by friends and family. I enjoy every interaction I have with patients and health professionals, learning and understanding research and the medical field. I understand the hardships and the daily challenges of life in medicine, yet I am confident in my abilities and am sure of my purpose. Every experience in my life has confirmed my passion. I want to become the “fairy” I grew up respecting, a doctor that my grandparents would be proud of.","I have been exposed to different cultures, religions, and ethnicities since I was young through my friends and family, developing an appreciation for the diversity I see. Through my exposure, I was aware of the discrimination and biases that exist in society, and when I went to college, I sought courses to help me understand this discrimination. I selected courses focused on subconscious biases, how to identify those biases, and how biases affect society. I then took a course focused on understanding and helping poverty in my college‚Äôs surrounding area. As I learned more, I wanted to continue broadening my knowledge by learning about discrimination in different cultures and religions through a course on genocide. I learned about the lesser-known genocides of the Armenian people, the Bambuti tribe, and more as well as the well-known ones like the Holocaust. Through these courses, I realized how much I don‚Äôt know and how much I will never know because I am not a minority.","Though I worked as a Caregiver for a short time, I had a huge impact on the people I worked with and in the special needs community. When I became a Caregiver for these 4 women with disabilities, I became a part of their daily lives. I was with them for 8-12 hours of the day, communicating and interacting with them. I helped them with their psychological and physical needs as they communicated with me about their emotions, their health, as well as their wants and needs. As I continued to bond with them, I became close with their families as I was involved with their social life as well as their healthcare, speaking to physicians and psychiatrists about their wellbeing. When I returned to college, I understood the impact I had on these women. I received numerous calls from their current caregiver and their family members, saying they were asking for me. It was then that I realized how important I was to these women and how I affected their daily life.",,,1,"Due to COVID, the students at my college were dismissed from campus and required to return home. When classes switched to online, I realized how difficult it was to take courses meant to be in person, online, at home. After a month, I began to understand the mental strain of staying at home. I am an extrovert, and the inability to go out in big groups and see friends was a difficult change for me as I had to learn to cope with being inside constantly. However, I stayed excited because I had been accepted on a mission trip and a medical internship through my college in the underprivileged areas of South Africa. Sadly, the mission trip was cancelled along with the internship. Additionally, all study abroad plans for 2020 were cancelled as well. I was accepted to a university in South Korea for a semester abroad where I would have experienced a completely different country, culture, and language. I became fearful and overwhelmed as I was unsure what the future held.",1,0,3

As I initiated our active rescue protocol, I realized the tremendous responsibility that lay in my hands. After each message, my stomach churned as I awaited their response; time could not have passed by any slower. I thought of the loneliness Max must have felt without their family’s support, a family who “didn’t believe in depression.” My heart ached to hear the distress they were in, and I wanted to do everything in my power to alleviate their pain. Forming intimate connections with patients like Max, who were in a vulnerable time in their life, fueled my desire to become a physician.
I knew that providing Max with a safe, comforting, and accepting environment would be crucial, so I utilized the skills I developed as a clinical assistant at Suburban Medical and Wellness Center. For example, when answering patients’ questions at the center, I simplified everything into manageable steps, translated medical jargon into understandable terms, and checked for comprehension. I learned that the simplest actions made the most significant differences. To make that same impact on Max’s life, I validated Max’s feelings and asked questions with genuine interest. As I reaffirmed to Max that their presence in this world was valuable, they agreed to consider alternatives to suicide with me. Despite my wholehearted efforts, not all cases had such a happy ending. The sense of loss I felt after an unresponsive active rescue drove me to work even harder and provide more relief. I felt immense fulfillment having the opportunity to help each person live to experience another day and enjoy their life even more.
My work as a crisis counselor paralleled my time volunteering at Blind People’s Association, a school for disabled children, where I observed differences in the treatment of marginalized people and the results of a lack of access to adequate healthcare. I heard how Radha, a girl close to my age, could not meet healthcare and educational needs as her family viewed her as “less valuable.” Her story inspired me to found Care for Precious, a nonprofit organization dedicated to addressing the needs of vulnerable populations. By implementing mentorship programs, distributing goods, and hosting workshops, I learned the importance of staying committed to a cause and listening to others’ perspectives. My time working to combat these health disparities taught me to advocate for those who confided in me and pushed me to explore medicine further.
As I dove deeper to understand medicine through shadowing, I observed the nuances and limitations of a career with such responsibility. It was heartbreaking to see a mother refuse treatment due to an inability to afford it, a newlywed couples’ dreams collapse as one of them was diagnosed with metastatic cancer, and another patient find no relief despite pursuing all available remedies for tinnitus. These limitations showed me how vital clinical discovery and comprehensive education are to improving human health. Staying updated on new findings and their implications will enable me to provide patients with the most effective, evidence-based treatments. By pursuing a career as a physician, I can harness its transformative qualities to increase the quality of life of others. Further exposure pulled me even closer into the realm of medicine: the challenge of diagnosis aligns with my love for problem-solving, and the team-based nature of healthcare speaks to my passion for collaboration.
Reflecting on my experiences, my perspective on the role of a physician has changed from someone who treats disease to someone who heals the body, mind, and spirit. As a patient named “Sally” began crying due to an intense fight with her abusive husband, leaving her stranded on a highway, Dr. Jagasia held her hand, nodded at each pause, and spent the time needed to make her feel safe and comfortable. Her frustration with her lingering symptoms melted away, and her motivation to improve her health increased as we modified the plan to match her circumstances at home. Just like Dr. Jagasia, I worked to treat Max with the utmost respect and understanding by establishing adequate support, providing practical coping skills that were personalized to their interests, and connecting them to more long-term resources. I hope to empower my patients to advocate for their own health while showing empathy when they are the most vulnerable.
Experiencing the genuine connection between a provider and their patient drew me to medicine. Even though many other healthcare professions contribute to leaving a meaningful impact on patients, I find that being a physician is the best fit for me. I want to be involved in the entirety of the treatment plan for patients and advocate for them when they are most vulnerable. I aspire to treat each patient with compassion and empathy while working to bridge gaps in healthcare. I look forward to harnessing the powers of medicine to extend every person’s most valuable resource and enable them to experience life to the fullest. I want to push the boundaries of medicine to make every story end like Max’s.","A life experience that has humbled my worldview is volunteering as a crisis counselor. Through this experience, I counseled texters and formed intimate connections with people contemplating ending their lives or undergoing self-harm. Working with those experiencing eating disorders, physical/sexual abuse, bereavement, substance use, depression, anxiety, LGBTQ+ discrimination, and other mental health concerns broadened my worldview as I listened to each individual‚Äôs personal stories and challenges. For example, engaging in a sixty-minute conversation with a survivor of rape touched my heart as I admired her resiliency and guided her in processing her thoughts, especially when she felt like she couldn‚Äôt confide in anyone else. I learned how to incorporate complete open-mindedness to connect with people with different backgrounds, value other perspectives to learn and grow from them, and support people empathetically to help them during a vulnerable time. ","I have impacted the unhoused community in Illinois through volunteering at C-U at Home Homeless Shelter to provide free otolaryngology care. Furthermore, I organized drives for the homeless through my nonprofit Care for Precious to donate blankets, personal hygiene products, oral health kits, care packages, sanitation supplies, masks, clothing, shoes, non-perishable goods, and other needs for shelters. I partnered with the shelter to refer people to affordable counseling services and provide additional mental health resources, like grounding techniques and coping skills to improve mental health. Through this initiative, I met ‚ÄúMegan,‚Äù to whom I recommended scholarship resources so that she could pursue a business degree. By partnering with local accounting corporations, I raised over $4,500 to support vulnerable communities further. The connections I made with her and others in these shelters motivate me to continue engaging with this community and advocating for them. _x000D_

In August 2016, my sister and I went to practice with our team for a five-mile run. While finishing the final mile on the track, I saw my sister lying down on the ground. I was initially impressed, because I thought she had finished the run and was recovering. Then, I noticed our teammates were huddling around her. Clearly disoriented, she kept saying, “I love you” to everyone around. Although my sister is an affectionate person, my coach was concerned and transported her to the local clinic. I was alarmed to see my sister debilitated. However, the way our family doctor consoled her allayed my fears. He has been a reassuring presence from the time I was a child. His capacity to match the emotional tone of the room while consulting is comforting and empowering. As we left the clinic that day, I wanted to serve people as he does; his compassionate practice of medicine was how I realized my own calling.

Service has always been an important part of my life. When I was younger, I volunteered to perform my violin and viola at nursing homes. The residents would perk up joyfully to my music, which brought me back often. This past year, I began volunteering with Promedica Hospice at a memory care nursing home. During my visits, I have learned about the lives of my assigned residents and have grown to love them, which makes it even more challenging to lose them. In December 2021, my assigned resident passed away. She enjoyed hearing stories, had a lovely smile, and charmed everyone. I was able to sit vigil with her before she died. It was a blessing to be able to say goodbye and to know she was with her children when she passed. Though a sad time, it was also beautiful. The staff on the premises honored her by lining the hallways as her body was taken to the funeral home. It was moving to see their respect for her life. The love for her was tangible. Hospice volunteering has taught me about grief, life, death, and love. I enjoy sharing my life and simply being with each resident, though they will likely never remember me.

In my medical shadowing experiences, I witnessed many physicians practice their specialties with a heart of service. During a pediatric rotation at a public hospital that I interned with during my study abroad in Puebla, Mexico, a two-year-old girl arrived at pediatrics with an enlarged liver. The attending pediatrician decided an MRI of her abdomen was needed for examination. She was anesthetized to hold still for the MRI, which was frightening to her and her parents as it could not be guaranteed she would react well to the anesthetic. However, the anesthesiologist and pediatrician comforted the family while the radiologist gave a primary analysis of the scan. It was the first breakthrough in the child’s case. She was transferred to another department the next day for more specialized care. The bedside manner and treatment from her pediatrician, anesthesiologist, and radiologist held the same qualities I saw in my family doctor. All these physicians were caring, understanding, and tactful with their patient and the patient’s family. I aspire to channel the leadership, teamwork, and compassion of these physicians in my own practice because they demonstrated how to use their skills to calm and best serve the patient.
I have been fortunate to receive a number of opportunities for leadership, teamwork, and medical knowledge, all of which are integral to service-oriented medicine. I currently work as a research technician in the Cole Eye Institute of the Cleveland Clinic. It has been a challenging but rewarding experience. I chose the lab to learn about ophthalmology, and now I know more about the eye, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy. Research is crucial for being able to help patients as new information and knowledge on how to interpret that information can make the difference, in this case, between sight and blindness. Research has also given me better problem solving skills. A few months ago, a coworker with past ophthalmic experience asked for my opinion on marking subretinal material in an image of wet AMD. I gave my opinion but also asked two other leads for theirs. The retinal layers were difficult to differentiate, but we found a solution to accurately quantify the disease burden. Communication and collaboration are the trademark of developing a healthy team dynamic. More recently, I asked the same co-worker for insights on choroidal neovascularization identification for a lab project, and he graciously provided examples. My work has equipped me with research and leadership skills which are essential for physicians working as part of an interdisciplinary team.

Medicine is innately service-oriented as patient care is the top priority. Many virtues and skills, such as humility, communication, and leadership, are necessary to provide the best patient care. The virtues and skills witnessed in my family doctor and the physicians I have shadowed propel me to pursue a career in medicine. Their example and the variety of experiences I have lived further confirm my desire to serve my community as a compassionate physician.","I volunteered in the summer of 2019 at Maggie‚Äôs Place in Phoenix, Arizona. Maggie‚Äôs Place serves pregnant women, providing them with housing, education, and career development. Many of the women struggled with past traumas or addictions. My role as summer corps was to organize and retrieve donations. Retrieving donations was akin to shopping for the moms. However, the options were limited to what had been donated._x000D_
_x000D_
One day, I received a request from a mom, but the clothing and baby toys she wanted were unavailable. When I told the mom, she ran to her room, slamming her door. I was stunned. From this experience, I learned how to prioritize the good of another, while seeking to understand why the incident occurred. The circumstances of having a traumatic background and living with a certain lack of autonomy explained the mom‚Äôs reaction. These are valuable lessons that I have found useful in other circumstances and likely will continue to in the future. ","I impacted my residential hall through my role as a residential assistant (RA). I was excited to be an RA for the 2020-2021 academic year. However, the role was different from what I expected. Training was much shorter, and there was an emphasis on hall staff enforcing COVID policies, such as mask usage. However, my central goal remained unchanged:  to serve as a support system for the first-year students. My own freshman year was difficult, but I remember my RA being a wonderful resource during that time. Meeting and spending time with residents through our section events was the best part of the year. My residents were a diverse group: students were from Chicago, Tucson, Los Angeles, and even the Northern Mariana Islands. We bonded over Einstein Bagel breakfasts and movie nights. Being able to walk with the students during a uniquely difficult year was a privilege. The pandemic was a struggle in many ways, but building a safe and resilient dorm community was truly rewarding.",,,1,"The COVID pandemic altered my gap year plans to work at the Sr. Maura Brannick Clinic in South Bend, Indiana. I loved interacting with patients when delivering their prescriptions or taking their medical histories. The clinic provided care to uninsured patients, the majority being Spanish-speaking and Arabic-speaking immigrants. I grew up speaking Spanish with my mother, who is originally from Mexico, and I studied Honors Spanish. My heritage helped me connect with the Spanish-speaking patients, but made it more difficult to have my experience cut short. The clinic allowed me to serve the community in a way that resonated with my love for my family. My brief experience at the clinic inspires me to improve medical care for underserved communities through research and clinical practice.

During a GI cancer trial, I spoke with a woman whose simultaneous inviting and assertive “hello” at the start of our conversation instantly revealed her drive to fight pancreatic cancer. Because of the comradery we developed, she was comfortable telling me that the VR experiences were uninteresting. I was not surprised to hear this; she was in the placebo arm. Following the trial, I visited her during a chemotherapy infusion and provided a headset with the full intervention. She emailed me soon after, sharing how it was making a significant difference in her pain and quality of life. 

Through experiences like this, I realized the symbiosis of researching new treatments and providing them clinically. My journey to medicine is defined by my efforts to bridge the gaps of time and equity that exist between research and clinical care.

At six years old, my grandfather, Dr. Samuel Rahbar (“Papa Samy”), took me to his lab at the City of Hope. Papa Samy answered my many questions about his discovery of Hemoglobin A1c and its role in diabetes, using blood samples from mice and explaining the differences to me. From then on, I was hooked on science. In college, I joined the Carmichael lab to study cell-based treatments for stroke, the malady that took my grandfather years prior. Our work was promising, but I realized the limitations of benchwork as it would be years before this therapy could benefit patients. I pondered how I could provide cutting-edge treatments to people currently in need.

The pandemic helped me answer this question. After losing my grandmother to COVID-19, I felt a responsibility to serve Los Angeles, a viral epicenter at the time. I volunteered to provide free testing and vaccinations to those facing barriers to these services. My favorite moments were those when I spent time with people discussing the test or vaccination, because these personal interactions translated to a healthier, better-informed community. One important role involved escorting patients to restrooms at the Dodger Stadium vaccination center. During this walk a veteran asked me why he was waiting after receiving his vaccine. I explained the vaccine had been rigorously tested but there was still a small chance of an adverse reaction. Though eager to leave, he appreciated our concern amid a chaotic scene in the massive parking lot. Answering a wide variety of questions about the vaccine during my time as a volunteer, I realized challenges in research related to communication and access hinder clinical applications to those who may benefit. 

Eager to overcome such barriers in our healthcare ecosystem after college, I began full time work under my mentor Dr. Brennan Spiegel as a clinical trial recruitment specialist. Speaking with patients about their attitudes and beliefs on using VR to manage their pain, I strive to understand them as people, not just participants. 

In our trial using VR for back pain, one man lived in his car and could not mail back the headset. When he dropped it off, we discussed the aftermath of his divorce and unstable living situation. Though he needed a receptive ear, I was the one humbled by his optimism as he declared that he would get back on his feet. When I realized he was not compensated due to incomplete surveys, I investigated and discovered that he merely forgot to press “submit”. I sent him a gift card and invited him to a focus group to discuss underrepresented populations in research. I learned that people trust me when I demonstrate a meaningful interest in their well-being that extends outside of a clinic visit or trial participation.

These interactions highlight issues of digital health equity and the importance of bringing such interventions to patients. In my Master’s in Health Delivery Science program, I am learning through courses in cost-effectiveness analysis and healthcare finance that access to digital health tools is hindered due to insurance and awareness issues. Though VR is free in our trials, I discuss these ideas with patients as part of the shared decision to use VR in their chronic pain journey. It has been exciting to integrate my master’s program capstone project with my real-life patient experiences. To create a blueprint for delivering research to patients who, for geographic or socioeconomic reasons, are not typically reached by clinical researchers, I am facilitating the integration of primary care clinics into our lab’s VR pain research pipeline. My goal is a novel method for health equity, where primary care, research opportunities, and innovative treatments are accessed under the same roof.

Research is vital to the progression of clinical medicine, but its impact is dependent on how equitably and efficiently its treatments are delivered to patients. I want to practice medicine comprehensively, applying the lessons of compassion and cutting-edge advances I learned from clinical research and my graduate education to those in need. This way, I will be confidently prepared to serve my patients, starting with every “hello”.","My parents‚Äô refuge in the USA following religious persecution in Iran helps me contextualize service as an aspiring physician.

I was eight years old when I started to notice her exhaustion and her accumulating doctor visits, changes that I only began to understand after accompanying her to a medical appointment. The rest was a blur. I can faintly recall my mother explaining to me that she would soon be taking some medication that was going to make her feel worse for a while and lose her hair. Little did I know, that was the day my mother was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer. 
The months that followed were nothing but frightening. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy sessions – all to treat what seemed to be a harmless bump on her chest. However, as I got older, I gradually began to understand the gravity of her condition and it made me realize that the possibility of losing my mother was real. Thankfully, she has been cancer-free since her operation, but this realization drove me to find ways I could help her in the future. Ever since her diagnosis, I have accompanied my mom to every one of her visits, serving as her interpreter whenever she needed help communicating with her physicians. During these visits, I took it upon myself to ensure I was relaying my mother’s concerns as accurately as possible, allowing her voice to be heard by every physician she visited. Facilitating these interactions on my mother’s path to recovery inspired me to consider a future in which I could care for patients of my own, listen to their concerns, and allow them to feel understood, just as I had done with my mother. 
Throughout the summer after my first year at the University of Virginia, I was able to apply my practical experiences of helping my mother to my role as a Patient Ambassador. As I visited patients throughout the UVA hospital, I would often receive requests that relieved the patient’s physical needs. However, this position also granted me the opportunity to provide a less tangible, yet just as important, form of care: a conversation. Through many patient interactions, I witnessed how effective communication and connection with a medical provider were equally as important as the administration of pharmaceuticals. In addition, my Mexican identity, as well as my fluency in the Spanish language, allowed me to extend care to a more diverse group of patients. 
Walking into “Alex’s” room, one of the Latino patients being treated on the floor, I had the opportunity to dive into a rich dialogue in Spanish about his family, his past, and even his aspirations in life. However, during this conversation, I also learned that his back had been sore from being too scared to ask in English to be repositioned. Instantly, memories of helping my mother through similar situations began to flood my mind.  Just as she and so many other patients have experienced, it seemed the fear and confusion of not being able to communicate proved to exacerbate their current state of physical discomfort. Although Alex's medical needs were met, I was reminded of how miscommunication can often prevent people from feeling taken care of. “¡Gracias!” he exhaled as I helped him up, but instead I found myself feeling grateful for Alex showing me how a shared connection helped patients like himself, as well as my mother, feel more comfortable and ultimately better cared for. 
While a sore back was Alex’s only discomfort, it is difficult to put into perspective how many patients are hesitant to tell the hospital staff crucial information about their symptoms that could potentially save their life. I believe that accessing this information can become more feasible when the fear of being misunderstood is decreased by connecting with the patient linguistically, culturally, and with empathy. The impact that a conversation can have on any individual has motivated me to expand this form of attentive care to every patient I encounter as a medical assistant. Through each patient interaction, I actively attempt to understand each person’s individual experience and recognize when they are not feeling understood. Regardless of one’s background, my aspiration in becoming a physician is to alleviate the feelings of fear, confusion, and isolation from the patient seeking medical treatment. By allowing each patient to freely express their personal health concerns, whether it be their sore back or even a seemingly harmless bump on their chest, I strive to ensure they are provided with the best possible care I can deliver, one conversation at a time.","As a medical assistant, I am responsible for administering allergy shots to many patients daily. One day, a new allergy shot patient came in, and as I explained how the shots worked and how I would administer them, I noticed her discomfort as she was going to have to expose her skin. She wore a hijab with a long sleeve shirt, but I reassured her I would be able to accommodate her based on her comfort level. We eventually figured out how to deliver the allergy shots in a way that respected her beliefs and boundaries. This interaction showed me the importance of respecting differences while providing an equal standard of care. By making healthcare more inclusive and finding new ways to provide care, we have a greater chance of impacting a greater number of people. As I train to become a physician in an increasingly diverse environment, I hope to recognize and respect the beliefs of my patients to deliver the best care I can provide.","Growing up and interpreting for my mom, my desire to help those who struggle to communicate continued as I saw similar challenges faced by other immigrant families I encountered while volunteering in college. However, these experiences have shown me that no matter what language is spoken, anyone can make a person feel more comfortable simply through a willingness to listen. When I encountered individuals that struggled to express themselves in a different language, I used the patience that I had developed from helping my parents communicate as a tool to bridge any communication gap that may prevent these individuals from receiving proper healthcare. I hope to bring and share this perspective with the student body at Rush Medical College as I believe that whether you speak their primary language or not, empathy for the patient‚Äôs experiences will greatly help in effectively communicating and caring for a diverse set of patients.",,,1,"The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every person on this Earth to some degree. Consequently, it impacted my ability to pursue certain clinical experiences between the years 2020 and 2021. Due to UVA‚Äôs effort to prevent the spread of this disease, the UVA Health System prevented any in-person volunteering, research, and shadowing for undergraduate students. Because of this, I sought out different virtual opportunities where I could volunteer, research, and shadow safely throughout the pandemic.

I always looked at my mother as the pinnacle of resilience. She would always say “jotto hashi, totto kanna,” a rather cynical Bengali proverb that translates to ‘the more you laugh, the more tears follow.’ She raised me to categorize emotions as weakness, defining strength as stoicism. Strength was never letting yourself truly feel. 

This mentality took a toll on my family. It delayed my sister from obtaining necessary mental health care, despite the signs she exhibited. Seeing my sister struggle prompted me to redefine what I had believed strength to be. A serendipitous telehealth call with a patient, “Sarah,” sparked the start of this journey.

It was during the pandemic, and I was volunteering for the Family Van, a mobile clinic. 
My role as a volunteer shifted from providing preventive health screenings to calling patients and connecting them to the Van’s extensive resources. Sarah was dealing with a myriad of issues ranging from food insecurity to managing rent. She was especially upset about her inability to obtain a registered emotional support animal (ESA).

“My daughter has a disability and is having a hard time coping while in school. I really do think getting her an emotional support animal would help her manage her anxiety better, but my landlord refuses to allow pets.” I was surprised to hear that this was her biggest priority, but realizing how much it meant to her, I worked to connect her with housing justice resources in Boston. After talking through various options, she thanked me, her voice flooded with relief: “If my daughter needs a cat to feel peace, then a cat is what I’ll fight for, honey. God did not put us here on this earth to struggle every day. There’s strength in being vulnerable.”

Hearing Sarah’s persistent efforts to bring her daughter ease, instead of encouraging her to repress her emotions, taught me the importance of finding peace in a world focused on glamourized struggle. Through this, I began to redefine strength as a celebration of human emotion rather than the absence of it. This shift in mindset has been crucial in shaping my desire to pursue medicine. Illness is a point in which people are at their most vulnerable state. As a physician, I will strive to empower my patients to choose effective treatments that also tend to their unique social and emotional needs.  

I have been able to witness many examples in which patient comfort has been a focal point of medical care. My experience of working as a medical scribe has tangibly shown me how to empower patients to find strength in vulnerability. When I look back, one patient stands out to me in particular. She entered the clinic, her face contorted in pain as she clung to her walker. With great difficulty, she propped herself on the examination table and turned to reveal severe deformation left in the wake of a botched gluteal augmentation. 

I observed as “Dr. Jacobs,” immediately took control of the scene, asking about her level of pain and whether she was comfortable disclosing the details of when she received the augmentation. The patient’s eyes welled with tears. “I feel like I did this to myself by seeking out this under the table procedure. I’ve been so afraid of asking anyone for help, but the pain is just unbearable.”

“You deserve to pursue procedures that make you feel confident,” Dr. Jacobs earnestly responded.  “I’m sorry that you received such poor care. As doctors, it is our responsibility to make sure you live not just the healthiest, but the most comfortable life. We will work through this together.”


I paused my notetaking, hoping to create a space that was more sincere and caring. I observed the various steps Dr. Jacobs took to make sure that the patient’s comfort was prioritized. He asked whether she had a support system at home to ensure her ability to rest and recuperate and offered her two different treatments, allowing her to have the final say in which one worked best for her. He made sure to not only tend to her medical needs, but also to her wellbeing as a whole. 

This taught me how vital vulnerability is within the physician-patient relationship. Without opening up about her covert procedure, the patient would have continued to endure chronic pain and suffering. There was strength in seeking advice to ease her discomfort and in trusting others to obtain the necessary care. Additionally, Dr. Jacobs met her halfway, cultivating a space in which her relief was highly regarded within her treatment. Upon reflection, I can truly see how the prospect of forming such meaningful connections has fundamentally shaped my love for medicine.

A physician’s role is to promote healing. Through my experience, I have learned that healing requires an intricate balance of prescribing strong treatment regimens while emphasizing patient comfort. Although society often equates strength with struggle, there is power in advocating for what feels right. As a physician, I hope to center vulnerability within the crux of the physician-patient relationship. I will always remind my patients that whether it is an emotional support animal or the choice between two effective treatment plans, I will advocate for their right to heal with ease.","As an educator, I work with students attending a variety of different high schools. One week, Jenny, a student from an underresourced school, pulled me aside in tears. She expressed feeling out of place as the only Black student and felt that she did not know enough to be included in the program. At this time, I drew from skills I had learned to help reassure her. I commended her for the leadership skills she demonstrated in class, and reminded her of some correct answers she had given. Later in class, I identified that students often fixated on getting the correct answer the fastest, leaving out those who did not have such strong science backgrounds, and quickly worked to address this. _x000D_
_x000D_
Jenny‚Äôs words taught me to step outside my comfort zone with my educational content and showed me that different people's lived experiences impact how they interact with education. As a physician, I will aim to keep this in mind as I teach patients about the conditions affecting their bodies._x000D_
","Growing up, it was easy to embrace my Bengali-Muslim roots; the two were not mutually exclusive. However, it became significantly more difficult as I started to incorporate queerness as into my identity. It was not safe to be open with my family, and the lack of South-Asian LGBTQ+ representation prevented me from approaching the topic with my friends._x000D_
_x000D_
Coming to terms with my sexuality has been a long process and my experiences have motivated me to advocate for others. I noticed how the Brandeis South-Asian and Muslim Students Associations lacked advocacy for sexual and gender minority students. Thus, during senior year, I organized a panel event to discuss the history of queerness in our communities. Seeing such a safe space created for myself and others was gratifying, and piloting this discussion event has set a precedent to ensure that these important conversations continue to take place. I hope to continue advocating for health equity among underrepresented communities at Rush.  ",,,1,,1,0,3
2023,15209710,,24,Woman,USA,0,,0,1,"I lived in a country with a subpar healthcare system for half my childhood. Facilities often lacked medication, equipment, adequately trained staff, and emergency intervention tools, such as blood transfusions, which led to delays in care and increased preventable deaths. I can easily recall when my brother and I carried our sick mother over five kilometers to a hospital where we had to wait hours to be seen by a physician because of the lack of transportation and poor road conditions. When we moved to America, I had to work to help provide for my family here and back home. I often had to prioritize my family's needs over my own. I could not participate in some extracurriculars because I was a full-time student, worked, and helped take care of my siblings. Faith and hard work have helped my family overcome many obstacles. Now, I want to give back to the communities both here and in The Gambia that have shaped me into the person I am today.

My mother's grip on my arm loosened, and she began to sob uncontrollably as my aunt placed me on her back. I grew more apprehensive and held my aunt tighter with every step. The blindfold was ripped off abruptly as I sat inside a bucket of water and found myself surrounded by the unfamiliar faces of other young girls. My aunt assured me that this procedure was good for me and that it would make me clean. Suddenly, two women held me down while a third performed the procedure. I let out several screams in response to the excruciating pain. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is the total or partial removal of external genitalia for non-medical reasons. This experience motivated me to become a global health trained physician who will serve as a bridge between medicine and underserved populations to improve care by establishing trust early on and boosting health literacy in the community.

My nuanced relationship with FGM shaped my relationship with the people around me and the healthcare field. Growing up in my home country of The Gambia, FGM protected me from being bullied by my peers for being a ""solima"" or a girl who has not undergone FGM. However, it also made me skeptical of physicians. I hid my ailments, such as migraines and stomach aches, from my mother because I knew she would take me to the hospital to see the ""Tubab"" doctors that practiced western medicine. I felt I could not trust them since they were against FGM, nor could I trust the native healers who performed the procedure. My hesitancy toward medical treatment diminished after I moved to America.

My perception of healthcare shifted when I became my stepmother's primary caregiver. I looked forward to attending her appointments and observing the interaction between my stepmother and her care team. During one of the visits, she was reluctant to undergo an electrocardiogram, but her care team guided her through it with patience and understanding. I became fascinated by the different tests conducted and the physician's holistic approach to medicine as I interpreted information between my stepmother and her physician. Despite countless exams, my stepmother's illness remains undiagnosed. This has further influenced me to become a physician to help find a diagnosis for others with similar symptoms. 

The experience with my stepmother motivated me to get involved in my community by shadowing and volunteering. While shadowing an OB/GYN, I met ""Ophelia,"" a homeless nineteen-year-old patient who grew up in a drug-abused home. She suffered from depression as a side effect of her birth control implant. She was afraid of needles and asked me to hold her hand to comfort her while the physician removed the implant. I saw the hope in Ophelia's eyes and sensed this small gesture was meaningful to her. During the procedure, she opened up to me about her life and her excitement to finally have a physician who looked like her. I found myself opening up to her about my background and culture. Through my interaction with Ophelia, I realized that my experiences as a Black immigrant woman would allow me to better connect to my patients, particularly those from underserved groups. I will establish trust early on with my patients so women feel safe in my presence.

As a Wellness Ambassador for the Foundation for Black Women's Wellness (FFBWW), I advocated for Black women's wellbeing and increased competent care in underserved communities. The FFBWW strives to improve health outcomes for Black women in Wisconsin through health and wellness services, advocacy, and the promotion of healthy living. While leading a discussion on wellness for teen girls, I realized there was a lack of knowledge in the Black community about reproductive health. Many of the girls not only misunderstood their menstrual cycles but felt ashamed of them as well. To combat this issue, I provided menstrual education and promoted self-acceptance through confidence-building exercises. It was apparent that the girls enjoyed the sessions and had a newfound confidence in attending school. I learned that as a physician, I could combine my expertise, aspects of my identity, and experiences to serve as a bridge between medicine and my community.  

Through shadowing and volunteering, I found that cultural differences and disparities in access to care are significant barriers. My experiences drive me to continue being an advocate for members of underserved communities and improve the quality of women's health services in these areas. Becoming a physician will give me the expertise and knowledge to educate communities about the psychological and physiological consequences of harmful practices against women globally, like FGM. I will continue educating young women on reproductive health while promoting self-acceptance and wellbeing. Additionally, I would like to work toward increasing culturally competent care in the U.S. by advocating for cultural awareness training for physicians. As a physician, I aim to empower my patients and instill confidence in them as agents of their bodies.","In 2019, a friend's homophobic stepfather kicked him out after a fight. He couldn't stay with his grandparents because they were unaware he was gay and feared rejection. My friend enjoyed cross-dressing and was vocal about gay rights, so I was unaware he hid his sexuality from his family. I realized I had created a fixed image of him that caused me not to see the internal battles he endured. As a result, I have worked to ensure that I view the people in my life as complex individuals with different layers of depth. Now, I have more profound conversations with my loved ones to gain a deeper understanding of them as individuals. Lastly, I learned to appreciate the impact the adversities people face have on them instead of comparing them to others' challenges. In the future, I will continue learning more about others to ensure that I do not make the same generalizations with the patients I encounter. _x000D_
","My cousin and I did everything together growing up. Things were great until people started comparing us to each other. Her mother frequently pressured her to lose weight to be like me. My cousin internalized these comments, which gave her low self-esteem. She stopped eating to lose weight, her grades suffered, and she hated herself. I was afraid to confront my aunt about her comments, so I decided to share my insecurities with my cousin instead. I expressed wanting to gain weight but being fearful because people told me that being skinny was ideal. After watching videos online, my cousin and I embarked on a fitness journey together. Our initial goals were to gain and lose weight; however, we soon fell in love with fitness. Soon after, our goals shifted to getting stronger and learning to appreciate our bodies.

I did not grow up with doctors around me, nor did I have anyone seriously encouraging me to pursue medicine. Becoming a doctor or lawyer was something I thought other people did, rich people perhaps, but not me—not my family. Theoretically, I always knew it was an option, yet it sounded nearly as far-fetched as when other kids claimed they were going to become astronauts or the President of the United States. Sure, one of those starry-eyed children might have actually wound up exploring the cosmos, but even from a young age, wishing on a star seemed akin to playing the lottery—one-in-a-million at best.

Medicine seemed out of reach to me back then, but art, a subject I thoroughly enjoyed, seemed much more tangible. My godfather Andre was an artist and an early role model of mine. The countless childhood afternoons spent in his studio have since blended together, but I will never forget the day he was commissioned by Nike, which to my 7-year-old-mind was as good as becoming the POTUS. I wanted so badly to be Nike-level good at something. Validated by my admission into an advanced art program, I thought maybe I had gotten a head start on what would be my future, but as much as I enjoyed art and other creative pursuits, I realized I didn’t want to be an artist. Exasperated, I traded Crayolas for calculators and threw myself into schoolwork. By the time I was in high school, I had fallen in love with biology. Understanding living systems came naturally to me, and for the first time in a long time I felt a genuine connection to a subject, a thrill I rode all the way to college.

Faced with a plethora of possibilities, I started pursuing biology generally. While I struggled to nail down a more specific major, I found myself surrounded by fellow students who, when asked what they planned to do at Columbia, would coolly reply, “Pre-med.” I was impressed by the concision and certainty with which they answered, all the while thinking that could never be me. Belonging to the small percentage of publicly educated students at Columbia, I felt I lacked the same educational foundation as most of my peers, but the reality was we were all taking the same classes. The coursework no longer seemed as lofty and esoteric as I made it out to be, and suddenly my thinking shifted: why not me? Excited yet apprehensive, I brought my newfound confidence to my advisor for next steps. However, our meeting left much to be desired, and my prospective changes were met with more discouragement than support. “Unless you’re 100% sure it’s what you want to do, I wouldn’t recommend it,” she said matter-of-factly, not bothering to introduce me to the pre-med timeline or resources for me to explore on my own. In my freshman naivety, I heeded her advice and let the registration period slip by without adding any pre-med classes to my schedule. Seemingly benign, this misguidance would later leave me scrambling to finish my major and Columbia’s core curriculum within 4 years. I knew post-bacc was always an option, but I was determined to chase my dreams on my terms, even if it meant taking on a heavier course load in later semesters.

Although I felt alone in my decision, my switch was met with overwhelming support from friends and family. I built connections with so many other students on the pre-medical track and we all took turns supporting each other through the rigorous classes, but as the intensity increased, those familiar faces began to fade. By junior year, most of my friends found their hearts were not truly committed to medicine and decided to switch paths. Senior year became incredibly lonely, and with the threat of a global pandemic on the horizon, it was tempting to uncommit myself, yet I persevered despite the challenges. Unlike with prior pursuits where my interest waned with exposure, my desire to practice medicine grows stronger each day. Reflecting on my clinical, volunteering, and shadowing experiences, I am thankful for the opportunity the Bakers provided me at Riverside Medical Group where I went from having no exposure to medicine to being able to anticipate diagnoses and treatments. Since then, I have worked in family medicine, gastroenterology, emergency medicine, and presently dermatology. I have shadowed pediatricians and nephrologists. I have tended to the needs of hospital patients and their families, and perhaps most valuable of all, I have provided compassionate patient care in a pandemic during which I myself was terrified.

Health is fundamental to every person, and to be trusted with such an essential and sensitive part of people’s lives is the utmost honor and a tremendous responsibility I have spent years preparing for. I recognize the importance of being a young Black female in a field where I am not traditionally represented—somewhere patients may not be used to seeing someone who looks like them and either understands or is willing to understand their cultural background. Now cognizant of the effect a lack of representation and encouragement had on me, I strive to be both a positive role model and a standout provider. I may not have had a good answer for my advisor freshman year, but I can now confidently say that I am 100% sure this is what I want to do.","After my parents‚Äô divorce in 2007, my mom, brother, and I relocated to Fort Lee, NJ where nearly half the population is of Asian descent. This was a huge change coming from Teaneck where the extent of my exposure to Asian culture was my family‚Äôs favorite sushi restaurant. Most of my new friends were either first- or second-generation Asian-Americans, and I spent many afterschool afternoons at their homes. Although I was young and nervous about being different, I found their families were actually happy to share their culture with me._x000D_
_x000D_
Experiencing culture shock early on in my life has made me a more tolerant individual and has fostered a general curiosity about others. It will always be important to me that I surround myself with a variety of people and personalities for my own personal growth. Healthcare is unique in that everyone needs it, but everyone needs it differently, and I therefore strive to be adaptable, compassionate, and culturally sensitive in my approach to patient care.","The creation of Polaris Academy was not only meaningful to me but also to my peers who helped create it and the community it was created for. Many students do not make the most of their early high school years, and we wanted to encourage kids from our town to make goal-oriented decisions and aim higher. While academic achievement was a major objective of our program, personal development was not neglected, and I encouraged my mentees to explore creative pursuits. One of my mentees, Shadae, was honest about her general disinterest in school, but expressed an interest in fashion and photography. We would spend our meetings taking photos for her to practice editing in her downtime and making plans for her future, including adding classes like digital media and advanced painting to her schedule, saving up for a new camera, and creating a portfolio for fashion school. While I cannot take credit, Shadae began her first year at FIT last fall, and I am happy to have been a part of her journey.",,,1,"After graduating virtually in May 2020, I was employed almost immediately at a local urgent care. The smallest of three locations, we had the least staffing and struggled the most when COVID ramped up. As a frontline worker, I spent long hours in a physically and mentally taxing, high-risk environment, and most of 2020-2021 was almost entirely consumed by the pandemic. Prepping for the MCAT or beginning my application my first year post-grad came second to combatting a global health crisis. When COVID finally became more manageable, I was able to start the process for medical school with fewer distractions. Although I did not begin my application as early as I would have liked, I would not trade my experience for anything less. I will undoubtedly encounter tough challenges in my journey to becoming a doctor, but I am proud of the care I delivered during a universally trying time and feel significantly more resilient as a result.",1,0,1

To master another language is not simply to interpret; it is to collaborate on common ground, it is to inform and further oneself from ignorance, it is to feel compassion because one can relate. As a female, second-generation, Pakistani-American Muslim, I know that the reality I live in is different from those around me. The languages that have shaped my worldview play a large role in that. I speak the language of the minority, one that is often misrepresented. I hope to use the languages that I speak to create a more equitable health system, thus a higher quality of life for others.

Firstly, I speak the language of culture. As I speak Urdu, English, and Spanish I can break language barriers with individuals whose backgrounds enable them to see the world differently. I had the opportunity to utilize this when I met a refugee family while shadowing at my local hospital. Their native language was Urdu, and I was able to help translate their diagnosis and treatment options. This was a rewarding experience for me as I was able to aid the patient in feeling comfortable while receiving the care they needed. This language allows me to navigate different perspectives and thus provide care with compassion and empathy.

 I speak the language of the female leader. My mother, a female physician herself, showed me the importance of compassion and dedication. I watched and learned how she extended such matriarchal qualities beyond our family and into our community. So, I committed outreach too. As the only female board member of my university’s Muslim Students Association, I brought my voice to the table and worked with a team. As a youth group leader, I inspired others to pursue their passions no matter the limitations they face — just as my mother had modeled for me. Being a strong leader also requires an understanding of the mechanisms of change. As an aspiring physician, I not only aim to heal patients but to also heal the system. This is why I place an importance on the disciplines of science, political science, and health administration. Through my studies of laws and policy, I have learned the systems of healthcare that govern our ability to heal. The study of policy is one of my passions, but through my experiences in healthcare I have realized that I want to have first-hand experiences with patients so that I can advocate for them from the inside; thus, improving their lives both personally and systemically. I aim to utilize my knowledge and experience to blaze a strong path forward for myself and others — one built on understanding, teamwork, and respect; all of which I will bring to my future career as a physician.

I speak the language of the patient. I learned this language by caring for members of my family who were ill, volunteering at community hospitals, and being a patient myself. What really solidified my understanding of this language was realizing that there is only a single entity that truly matters. It is the very thing that gives you life yet also takes it away. It is constant until it is not — your heartbeat. In 2018, I stood above a man with his chest cut open and stared down at his beating heart. I realized this is what my heart beats for. At this moment, as I shadowed an open-heart surgery at a free hospital in Pakistan, I solidified my passion for the human body and my drive to become a physician. This experience highlighted a simple fact of life: our society is only as great as the health of those who compose it. This idea is under attack around the world. In some areas, healthcare is inaccessible; in others, it is not at the caliber at which it ought to be. I recognize the responsibility of the medical provider is to help maximize each patient’s quality of life. This language highlights the importance of patient-provider communication to ensure patients feel comfortable and acknowledged. In this language, healthcare is half science and half trust.

Lastly, I speak the language of science. This is a language I have spent many years learning and admiring, and one which I desire to keep practicing. Early in my undergraduate career, I struggled with this language. I found that I had thrown myself into this field without firm reason. I spent time trying different subjects and approaches until I recognized that success comes through following one’s passion. I realized that my setbacks were leading me back to my love for the language of science. I realigned myself with my appreciation for the sciences through research, academia, and shadowing while incorporating my other passions such as advocacy and law. Rediscovering my drive allowed me to flourish in my last few years of my undergraduate career and further on into my masters education. This prepared me for medical school and solidified my dedication to the language of science. I practiced my perseverance and committed myself to growth and learning. These very principles push me towards achieving excellence in the medical field. If admitted into medical school, I will be granted the opportunity to further my education in the human sciences. Mastering the language of science, both a social and academic one, will allow me to prosper as an aspiring physician.","As a minority myself, understanding others is a core tenant of who I am. Personally, I have organized interfaith gatherings in my community which foster healthy relationships between those of different beliefs and backgrounds. As a leader of several cultural organizations at my university, I organized educational events regarding overlooked communities. Further, my advocacy has extended beyond problems that plague my own life. As a campus leader, I helped raise money and awareness for the Black Lives Matter and Anti-Asian Hate movements. Understanding and fighting for those who are different from oneself is crucial in creating an innovative and healthy society. I learned that ignorance comes from a lack of knowledge, compassion, and understanding. The responsibility to be welcoming to all extends into life as a medical student and physician. I hope to do this by educating myself and others, standing up for fair policy changes in medicine, and by prioritizing patient rights and health.","My experiences and identities have taught me how to work with compassion and ultimately use my knowledge and passions to positively impact others. This was exemplified by my time working in a nonprofit hospital in a low-income area of Pakistan. I learned about my own privilege and the responsibilities that come with that. Here, people traveled for days to reach the hospital. They would wait outside in long lines, in hopes of seeing a physician. Regardless of this struggle and lack of access, these people were still grateful. Being part of this hospital, I felt a great sense of purpose and fulfillment. I learned that knowledge is a privilege and using that knowledge for positivity is my responsibility. These realizations inspire me to practice medicine in underserved populations, join initiatives for cost-free medical missions to areas in need, work towards more equitable and extensive policies regarding access to healthcare, and educate myself and others about healthcare disparities.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on our world ‚Äì‚Äì I was no exception. The pandemic canceled my travel plans, part of which involved volunteering in Pakistan. However, I used this as an opportunity to help in different ways that resulted from the pandemic. One of these was to virtually tutor children in minority communities, which helped them to adjust and overcome the challenges of virtual learning. Academically, my shift to virtual learning impacted my ability to interact with others, but I learned to utilize virtual spaces to foster a good relationship with my professors and peers. During this time, I was preparing for the MCAT. Due to the pandemic my exam was postponed for four months. This uncertainty and constant change was difficult to study and test through, but I developed strong lifelong study habits to help me succeed under stress. The pandemic was a challenging time but I was able to learn ways to succeed through difficulties and find new ways to give back.",0,0,2

Laying in the emergency department after a weightlifting injury, I could only grasp the rails of the bed to distract me from my pain. Blitzing through the doors, the emergency medical service team wheeled in a breathless infant on a stretcher. Dr. Smith darted to the infant to administer medical treatment. Hovering over him, each set of chest compressions was followed with the hope of a breath. His shouts for lab orders, imaging, and the next steps of treatment broke through the ear ringing ambulance parked outside. I wanted to jump out of the bed to help in any way, but I could only watch with a breaking heart. Moments passed, and like a miracle, the infant took his first breath back into the world. With a rising chest for each breath, Dr. Smith's relief reflected off the shimmering tears and sweat now pooled on the tile floor under him. I had no idea what had happened, but I was certain I had witnessed the type of care only a physician could offer. Squinting at the blinding ceiling light that towered over me, the longing to be free of pain paled in comparison to the newfound longing to provide life-changing treatment to patients in need.

I wanted to be a person who, when all hope seems lost, can be entrusted with patients in their most vulnerable state. I yearned to experience and understand what it was like to be part of the healthcare team taking care of patients. With a clear goal in mind now steering my decisions, I began working at the hospital as a clinical technician.

The vibrant emerald, green eyes returned their gaze with a contrasting empty expression. One of my patients, Mary, was so old, so fragile, and so silent without words. Giving her a spoonful of dull, orange potatoes, she turned her face away from the food with furrowed eyebrows. Asking if there is anything I can do to make the food more palatable, she finally broke her silence with a single word, ""salt."" Jumping with excitement and almost tripping on the floor mat, I sprinkled a pinch of salt over her potatoes. She took another bite and I hoped for a smile or a nod of approval, but she pushed the spoon away with a raised eyebrow. The same word came out of her mouth. Looking back at the salt package, both of us read sugar. The radiating smile on her face was bright. Bursting into laughter, her silent character began to crack into a playful friend. I may not have made the most significant impact during her treatment, but the change in her character mirrored her growth during her stay at the hospital. This experience ignites my heart to further my medical training to the greatest level and propels me to continue pursuing my goal of becoming a physician. I hope to bring healing into patients' lives, not just through my interactions with them, but also through the highest level of care.

I later found myself in another clinical setting, this time as a medical scribe. Mike blazed through the doors with the urgency-stricken nurse who rushed him into the clinic in his wheelchair. He stared blankly into the far distance as he was rolled into the exam room. Mike sat in front of the slit lamp, ready for the evaluation. Peering through the lens, the doctor shook his head and confirmed the retinal detachment seen on the imaging. The deafening sound of surgery pierced through the conversation between Mike and the doctor. He shoved the slit lamp away and tore the surgery forms into flying pieces. He did not want surgery and he had limited access to transportation with his required wheelchair. I knelt to eye level and told him my grandmother had lost vision in her right eye and she has been receiving treatment to improve her vision with the other. After accommodating Mike with transportation, he decided to proceed with the surgery and take the first steps to recover his vision. It hurts me to see patients turn away from treatment. Breaking the barriers that prevent patients from receiving optimal healthcare is required for change to happen. Advocating for patients like Mike is necessary and can change the course of both their care and life. I hope to be a physician who advocates for patients to make their health a priority and help them make the best decisions for their health.

Through my experiences, I have been with patients in many different stages of their treatment. Watching the infant in the emergency department, I witnessed the life-changing possibilities that a physician can offer. Feeding Mary, I experienced the difference that can be made with small but sincere actions. Advocating for Mike on a personal level, I realized the value of bridging the gap between needs and healthcare. The vulnerability shown to me by the many patients I have had the honor of serving has solidified my goal of becoming a physician. My encounters with the multitudes of patients are a reminder of the goal I am pursuing. I hope to be a physician who tends to the patient's health in the most trying times of their lives and advocates for their health. I hope to be a physician who is driven to serve those who are limited in their access to healthcare.","‚ÄúWe need labs for room 12,‚Äù the nurse told me as she ran by me. Opening the door, I see Max squinting while holding his right leg. I began setting up my supplies for the blood draw on the table, but the weight of the mother‚Äôs glare sank me through the floor. She towered over me with her eyebrows lowered. She declared that her son‚Äôs blood will not be drawn. She told me they were Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. Unsure of their beliefs, I asked her many questions as she gradually uncrossed her arms. She allowed me to collect the labs because the blood was only to be used for testing purposes. I drew Max‚Äôs blood and he smiled as he told me that not many times, did he get his blood drawn well the first time without pain. Physicians will be engaged with those of diverse backgrounds, sometimes even coming across those with backgrounds they have not interacted with before. Working with others from different backgrounds requires a willingness to understand their beliefs and a sensitivity to their needs.","Josh returned to the clinic for his monthly medication injection in her left eye. For many years now, he has been receiving these injection treatments to maintain his vision. My first encounter with him was many months ago. He walked slowly, cautious of bumping into another person or furniture. He was told to begin treatment immediately because the risk of losing vision was high. Without insurance and money to pay for treatment, he told me he wanted to defer treatment at the time. Bringing this up to the physician, we had him enrolled into the copay program, which has been helping to alleviate the cost of his medical care. At his latest appointment at the clinic, he read each letter on each line perfectly. Had he not received treatment early, it is possible that he could have lost his vision. My experiences with patients like Josh have led me to believe that it is necessary to serve the medically underserved populations in our community so they can receive the treatment they deserve.",,,1,"Luke, a 12-year-old boy I met while distributing care packages, coughed persistently in the cold winter air. I suggested he see a physician. He told me that without medical insurance, his family did not have the financial means to see a physician regularly._x000D_
An inability to start my job after graduating allowed me to invest in my community further. The pandemic altered the course of my volunteer group.

Many people in my community found it difficult to access healthcare without medical insurance. Without insurance, the financial burden of healthcare is a barrier that is hard to overcome.

My ailing sibling was dehydrated and fatigued, groaning in pain. I scanned the room and saw 100 patients requiring acute medical care, and there was only one medical officer - it was heartbreaking. I learned that the most crucial medical supplies were scarce or even lacking. Later, I lined up at the pharmacy unit to collect drugs after a positive amebic dysentery test, only to be told that there was no metronidazole to treat my sister’s ailment. A medical facility missing a drug to treat a diarrheal infection as common as dysentery speaks to the scarcity and lack in public hospitals in my homeland.   That was perhaps the first time pursuing a career in medicine crossed my mind.  
When I moved to the United States at the age of 15, I experienced firsthand the impact that a properly developed healthcare system has had on our lives and how much underserved communities both here and globally can benefit from it. For many years prior to moving to the United States, I had this left upper quadrant abdominal pain. However, I did not want to be a burden on anyone, so I suffered in silence and took some herbal medicine known as “obosaro” that was known to “heal all ailments.” It was not until the Fall of 2016, beginning of my freshman year in college when I finally told my father I was not feeling well, and he told me that I could go to an urgent care since I was covered under his insurance. I was diagnosed with peptic ulcers that had been caused by Helicobacter Pylori and received treatment immediately. While this was a blessing to have had the opportunity to move to the US, this experience affirmed my desire to become a physician. 
 Soon after, I decided to enroll in pre-medical classes. These classes were engrossing, and given my success with these courses, I became motivated to participate in a research lab where we focused on apolipoprotein a1, a component in HDL and is implicated in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. I worked with a graduate student to identify C-terminal residues implicated in self-association and lipid binding.   My contribution, albeit small, taught me how to work in a team, with patience, especially when experiments don’t go as anticipated, and improved my critical thinking  through making inquiries, analyzing information and evidence, and arriving at conclusions. 
Although I enjoyed various aspects of research in the lab, my desire for a career in clinical medicine became stronger, and I became a certified nursing assistant (CNA). On my first day as a CNA, I was unsure if I could aid the residents. My doubts were cast aside soon because I realized that the rewards of medicine stem from serving those that needed help whether it was helping a resident find their room or even learning to say a few foreign words to communicate with a resident. Seeing the smiles on their faces through each positive interaction was a reward. 

Ultimately, I knew I needed more direct personal interaction and began working as a medical assistant at Action Urgent Care. I observed here that medicine is diverse, including the patients, the illnesses, and treatments .  I have evaluated two different patients with similar UTI symptoms leave the clinic with different diagnoses and different medications, while some with the same diagnoses respond differently to the same treatments. Similarly, while shadowing Dr. Sikander, I witnessed one patient with hypertension had lower dosages of both lisinopril and amlodipine, while another only had a higher dosage of lisinopril. I learned being a doctor requires attention to detail, especially when getting a patient’s medical history, because it gives a better understanding of the patient. 

As I desired more direct interactions with patients, I decided to complete volunteer work at a free medical camp in Kenya. Most people in this community are barely making it, and our services could not have come at a better time. Through our health screenings, I observed a few common diseases among the children as well as some adults in the community. Others had conditions not so common. For instance, a five-year-old male was diagnosed with cryptorchidism from preliminary examination that needed an urgent ultrasound and surgical correction. His parents told me that they could not afford said services, and so efforts to raise funds for him became underway. These patients exposed me to difficulties in healthcare accessibility and inspired me to practice medicine with the underserved in mind.

My motivation and preparation for a career as a medical doctor started off in an unexpected way but has led me to my research, my volunteer activities, and my work to recognize the responsibilities that lie ahead in medicine. As I reflect on my personal experiences, I have solidified my determination to practice medicine with empathy, compassion, attentiveness, humility, and confidence. I know that medicine will be a challenging career, but that is partly what draws me to it. I believe that to develop my love for science further while allowing my passions to serve my patients will be a rewarding experience.","At my first job ever, I experienced a shift in demographics, where I found myself to be the only non-Spanish speaker that worked there. I felt out of place and a lot of the time was not included in what was happening at work. I understood that it was most likely not personal but due language and communication barriers. Instead, I began paying attention to what was being said and asked questions in order to learn some vocabulary. Although I don‚Äôt speak Spanish fluently, I can now communicate to some extent. I‚Äôve moved enough through my life to know it can be tough being the only person who is different from others in a group of people, or even being the new person. To this day, similar experiences echo in my daily life and I am glad I took the lessons from this experience with me. I understand that as a physician, I will encounter a varied group of patients and I look forward to using my presence in a diverse workforce to enlighten others who might not have the same experience as mine.","In Swahili, we have a saying that goes ‚ÄúTenda wema nenda zako,‚Äù meaning do good and move on. Growing up, it was a lesson not only emphasized at home but also at my church. My family had very little growing up, it always amazed me how positive and generous my parents were. Perhaps that provided some inspiration because as I got older, I continually felt drawn to helping others. I started organizing several clothing and shoe drives when I was a teenager, the most recent one being a clothing and shoe drive I helped organize for Shining Star children‚Äôs Home, an orphanage in Kenya. The most rewarding part was seeing the appreciation among the recipients, many of whom had probably never dreamt of receiving that much. I felt uplifted to improve the wellbeing of others. I admit that however small an act of kindness is, the ripple effect can be immeasurable and therefore, in my aspiration as a physician, my desire to serve humanity will be fulfilled. _x000D_

2023,15212852,,35,Man,USA,0,,0,1,"I always enjoyed the escape education provided me and dreamed of going away for college but had no direction or references on how to achieve higher education. My mother was a homemaker that immigrated from Mexico. My father was a military man who was gone for most of my young life. As the eldest of three, I helped to raise my brothers when my parents eventually ended their marriage. I lived less than four miles from the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry in a predominantly Spanish-speaking neighborhood. While the blending of Mexican and American culture is a beautiful thing, it comes with its own trials and tribulations. It was impoverished and lacked the infrastructure needed for children to feel safe. And the socioeconomic status of surrounding neighborhoods contributed to poorly performing surrounding educational systems. We did not have a school bus route available so we walked to school in areas saturated with gang life. It felt impossible to concentrate on my studies, let alone excel. At 17 years old, I followed in my father's footsteps and I enlisted in the Navy for 10 years. The mission always came first during my years of service and higher education was not a priority of the uniformed service. It did, however, provide me with the tools to start my journey in higher education.",U,1,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,1,,60950,170.0,110.0,30.0,5800.0,,1,140,1,5910,05/14/2022,National University,Biology,1,Veteran,No,No,Yes,"$50,000 - 74,999",5,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,17,Adequate,2,2023,2,5.0,0.0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"When people think of California, the golden coasts, near-perfect weather, and wealthy zip codes come to mind for many. However, some forget the terrible droughts and destructive fires that soon follow. Dry weather invites wildfires to scorch towns and forests, leaving behind ash. Thankfully, with destruction comes regrowth and beauty. The mighty giant sequoias of California are injured by fire but not killed–the trees require fires to accelerate the growth and survival of newer generations. New seedlings cannot grow to be free and stand amongst the greats without it. Nature teaches me about balance. The shifting equilibria in our world and the desire to share these occurrences connect us all.

My father says that challenges can serve as kindling in life; all that is needed is the spark. Becoming a US Navy Diver was the first spark that started my internal fire. Repairing US vessels underwater may be rewarding, but the job is inherently dangerous. On one November day, I was reminded of the dangers.

I was paired with a senior diver, Mike, to replace a 32-ton propeller on an aircraft carrier ship. Into a laborious hour beneath San Diego Bay's frigid and murky water, I heard a chilling cry. A hefty piece of equipment called a chainfall dragged Mike to the ocean bottom. I rushed to assist him in avoiding complications from exceeding the allowed depth and maximum dive time. As I touched the sea floor, visibility went from bad to worse; I had to rely on feel to search for him. Through the turbid water, I felt a hand grab my arm and soon spotted the amber glow of his flashlight; I had found him! Tangled up in chains and mud, Mike was stuck. While reassuring him that we would be okay, I freed him and the chains from the muck, and we quickly ascended from the deep. 

Unfortunately, we required time in a hyperbaric chamber to release built-up nitrogen from our systems to avoid diving-related illnesses. As we entered the chamber with our dive medical physician, ""Doc"" tended to our well-being with an infectious smile. I realized that comforting people in tricky positions could be just as important as helping them physically, especially when it comes from a friendly face. 

It was my first experience with an emergency in the Navy, and we lived to dive another day. Though jarring, Doc's swift ability to become the solution in a crisis left me enamored. After the incident, I felt an ignited desire to explore a new world of medicine to make similar impacts as Doc did for us. I soon set off to change my naval career to become a Special Operations Medic.

The fire inside me grew as I learned from exceptional physicians, senior medics, and supplemental courses. One such course was a 14-day professional development training designed to prepare me for scenarios that would require me to care for casualties with little resources for hours or days before help arrived. I believed that this course would be worthwhile if a medic could better train for unpredictable misfortunes. But I learned we would practice our new skills on actual patients – livestock. On the one hand, I was against the practice, as I have read opposing arguments citing little to no gain over training on manikins. On the other hand, having heard the benefits from doctors that completed this training, I put trust in the process to learn as much as possible in the days ahead. 

Upon my arrival, an anxious feeling of hesitancy crept up my throat. I took a breath, accessed my surroundings, and found a calm clarity wash over me. In my eyes, these anesthetized animals who deserved dignity and respect were now my patients. I continued studying and practicing prolonged care airway management, wound care, and pain management. The course concluded with a trying 48-hour-long application of the acquired medical knowledge and skills.

We partnered into two-person teams to collaborate on prolonged medical care scenarios presented by the instructors. My partner and I scheduled sleep rotations to monitor our patients, yet neither of us could sleep due to our elevated nerves. Instead, we shared deeply personal stories during lulls of the events. On the last day, relief came as the sun broke over the horizon. It was hard to part with the patients as it was difficult not to imagine them like fallen comrades. I thanked them and said my cathartic goodbyes. Though I initially struggled with the ethics regarding the practice of medicine on animals, I am glad I committed to the process. If a day of catastrophe comes, the skills I learned provided me the confidence that I can help on or off the battlefield.

My diverse and arduous experiences undoubtedly trailblazed a path for me to continue the pursuit of medicine, to forge upon my skills to make holistic and positive impacts. The unavoidable and challenging encounters have taught me to pause before reacting, becoming the solution in the face of adversity. Like a sequoia, progress has made my roots grow profound and my core more resilient, bringing me closer to a devotion that has always been inside me — people. My internal fire continues to drive me toward a better version of myself. I hope to continue raising my branches toward more knowledge and leadership in medicine to give back to my community as a physician.","When deployed in the Middle East, I was intrigued by the holiday of Ramadan, in which Muslim people fast from sunrise to sunset. My peers did not readily accept my curiosity as we were in an active war, but I found the culture too fascinating not to learn more about the religious practice. _x000D_
_x000D_
A gentleman who cut hair on the military base was a man named Aasim, and I started to ask him as many questions as possible. Aasim eventually invited me to a dinner in which they broke fast. It was such a simple yet profound experience for me. I had an epiphany; I knew then that people aren't so different. _x000D_
_x000D_
I believe sharing a meal with someone is one of the most basic yet educational pathways to understanding a culture. I realized that I was in the middle east in support of war and felt a bit of humility and guilt. I went on to learn more about the Muslim culture, and from then on, whenever I travel, I try the local food and strike up a conversation to better know the community. ","The most linear example I can think of is when I spent time with Burmese refugees in Mae Sot, Thailand. Although my main focus in Thailand was to attend a tropical medical course, I had the privilege of volunteering medical aid to the Burmese people escaping violence and religious persecution with the ""Eyes to Burma"" project. _x000D_
_x000D_
My primary duty in the makeshift village in a Thai open-air waste facility was treating the refugees directly under my supervising physician. The interventions would range from tropical diseases to trauma wounds, assisting with baby deliveries, and helping maintain the facility as needed.  _x000D_
_x000D_
The most significant rewards were receiving all the smiles after long swelting days and knowing I was one of the friendly foreign faces making a difference in their community. It was an unforgettable experience and a huge reason I left the military to pursue my dream of becoming a physician.",,,1,"I would like to address my MCAT performance. I was not an exception to the effects of COVID-19 and experienced personal hurdles. My wife and I lost people from our families during my MCAT preparation. It took more of a mental toll than I realized each time I signed up for the exam. However, my MCAT score does not accurately display my passion or ability in medicine, like my GPA, clinical experiences, or personal experiences. The process has made me more resilient and has only strengthened my love for medicine. I am grateful for those who held our family member‚Äôs hands as they passed and for the global push for vaccination innovation.",1,1,1

With a phone in one hand and my crying sister on my lap, I called 911 and went to the ER with my grandmother, ready to serve as my grandmother’s translator and my sister’s caretaker.
 
At the ER that day, I carefully wrote down the doctors’ wound care instructions in my pink Hello Kitty notebook. Every day for 2 weeks, I gave my sister medications and fluids, changed her gauze, and watched, intrigued, as her skin healed. Because our parents were away for weeks or months at a time for work, I often found myself taking on caretaking responsibilities for my sister. Some occasions led to amused stares — I was the only 11-year-old stand-in parent at the preschool’s Muffins for Moms brunch — but sometimes the responsibilities were more serious, including taking care of her every time she got hurt.
 

The satisfaction I felt helping my sister heal and the incredible resilience I saw of the human body was what put me on my path to medicine. My sister is extremely accident-prone and many more accidents were yet to unfold. But eventually, I was able to teach her her own care instructions, and transitioned from caretaker to care-teacher. 
 

Throughout college, the experiences that helped me strengthen and confirm my decision to pursue medicine also broadened my conception of care-teaching. In particular, I spent many hours volunteering at a local free clinic which served uninsured and homeless populations in greater Los Angeles. Many of our patients were immigrants and non-English speaking. As part of a three-person team, I took on many responsibilities, including translating for Telugu- and Spanish-speaking patients. My translations weren’t perfect, but I noticed that patients appreciated the effort and felt more comfortable when we met them where they were at. More than once, I found myself translating for someone else’s grandparents the way I had once translated for mine. Seeing recent immigrants struggle as my own grandparents had helped me understand the importance of culturally competent care and health literacy in vulnerable populations. 

 
These issues go hand-in-hand. One clinic patient, “Oscar”, who’d been given a free monitor and asked to track his blood pressure, brought an empty log sheet to his follow-up. He explained that neither he nor his wife could understand the monitor’s instruction booklet. Whenever he tried to take his blood pressure, all of his readings were outside of the possible ranges shown in the manual. In many cases, it would have been easy to mark this up to noncompliance; however, because we took the time to understand the lack of follow through without blame or shame, we were better able to identify and find effective solutions. We sent Oscar home with instructions written at an elementary reading level that included pictures. I also demonstrated properly tightening the cuff so he would know what it should feel like during a home reading. He brought his completed log to his next appointment, providing essential information about his health.
 

As I continued volunteering at the clinic, I felt a pull toward working with patients like Oscar and realized that I want to serve underserved communities and continue to make strides towards providing equitable care. Health disparities exist due to differences in socioeconomic conditions, some of which stem from financial insecurity and others from unequal access to interpretable health information. The height of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the spaces in which I could play a small role in addressing these disparities in health literacy. I have long been involved in journalism and have noticed many parallels between journalism and medicine: both doctors and journalists provide facts to empower others to make informed choices. However, most health information is written at higher than the national literacy level, which makes health information inaccessible to most people. 
 

With this in mind, I created Bruin Medical Review (BMR; soon to be SimplyMD), an organization that creates engaging health- and science-related content at a middle to high school reading level and hosts health-literacy outreach programming in the greater Los Angeles area. At BMR, I lead a group of over 100 student volunteers whose content reaches readers in 39 countries. I’ve returned to my role as a care-teacher, but now for a broader audience. I hope to make widespread impacts on health literacy by empowering many more people than just my little sister to engage with health and science information, thus creating more positive health outcomes. 
 

While I no longer attend Muffins for Moms or write wound-care instructions in my Hello Kitty notebook, I still desire to be the person who knows what to do in challenging situations and takes action not only as a physician, but also as an advocate for vulnerable populations and a leader in creating health-informed policies and improvements in health literacy. A career in medicine would make me a care-teacher once again, incorporating my passions into a fulfilling career while empowering others to make positive changes in their lives.","In high school, I participated in a summer homestay program in Germany, with my host mom and two host sisters, Nele and Zoe. I attended school with Nele where most of her classmates only spoke fluent German but could converse in some others. If I wanted to talk to Nele‚Äôs friends, we went through a list of possible languages we had in common and did our best. Some might find this frustrating, but for me, I developed a much deeper appreciation for diversity in culture, language, and life experiences. Since then, my favorite pastime has been learning languages. In high school, I took Spanish and Chinese; in college, Hindi and French. On Duolingo, I am actively learning three languages. I am not yet fluent by any means, but as I continue this interest, I hope to converse directly with patients from different backgrounds, without needing a translator. At Rush, I hope to similarly embrace the diversity in cultures, traditions, and thought processes of my peers and instructors. ","Conejo Free Clinic quickly became the single-most influential clinical experience I‚Äôve had. Being a necessary part of a three-person team was not only a large responsibility, it was also the experience that changed my trajectory in medicine. It was striking to me how so many individuals fall through the cracks of healthcare. By working with low-income and uninsured populations at a safety-net organization, I found myself wanting to pursue a path in medicine providing essential care to vulnerable populations. I grew up with immigrant, non-English-speaking grandparents who struggled to communicate with their health providers; my volunteering has been marked not only by clinical exposure, but also by witnessing and participating in advocacy for particularly vulnerable populations like my grandparents. My experience at Conejo Free Clinic solidified my desire to work at the intersection of policy and practice, advocating for health policy and providing excellent clinical care for all.",,,1,"I remain grateful that none of my direct family members contracted COVID-19, however the pandemic did affect my academic and professional pursuits. The research lab I was to join was shut down, my hospital volunteering was cut short, my study abroad programs were canceled, I was laid off from my job, and my shadowing opportunities were restricted to prevent unnecessary exposure. However, the pandemic gave me a chance to introspect. Free clinics near home needed more volunteers during the pandemic, and when I began volunteering in-person with vulnerable populations, I found that these were the populations I wanted to serve as a physician. I saw misinformation being spread and founded Bruin Medical Review to combat it and encourage engagement with science information. I saw my mom work tirelessly as a physician to support the patients who were able to be treated. COVID-19 changed the environment and activities that I had planned, but it also shaped the trajectory of my path in medicine.",1,0,2
2023,15217727,,23,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,0,,U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,16275,896.0,1200.0,3200.0,,101.0,1,4400,1,1301,06/30/2021,University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,Neuroscience; Romance Languages and Literatures,0,,No,No,No,Do not know,4,0,1,0,21.4,25.8,26.8,0.0,17.7,8.3,0.0,25,Exceptional,4,2023,4,2.0,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,"Language is the single most impactful means by which to stimulate the mind and the heart. It fosters trust, security, and harmony through which we gain the ability to connect to people living parallel lives across the globe. My captivation by neuroscience stems from its link to the mechanics of language and its usage. Yet it was through music, my longtime refuge and pure delight, that I discovered the unique ability for intense focus, precise logic, and astonishing creative expression of the mind. I was adamant to combine and grow my passions in college, which ceremoniously stimulated the expansion of my perspectives far beyond one that is centered on my own self. Further exploring medicine, languages, and music has devoted me to care about the needs of others and to service those needs through a single pursuit: patient care. 

Living in Lebanon from ages 3 to 8 cemented my love for languages, people, and cultures. I developed my reading, writing, and speaking skills in French and Arabic, and soon after moving to the States, in English and Spanish as well. Yet what I most gained from these formative years and the mastery of four languages is the awareness of the diversity of the human experience, which has allowed me to acknowledge the unconscious biases that may dilute our thoughts and actions. During one of my shifts as a language interpreter at the student-run free clinic, Spanish-speaking patient James and his mother were scheduled for a consultation. Throughout our discussion, it became evident that James may have been exhibiting schizophrenic symptoms for many years. In his hometown of Mexico City, James had consulted various physicians but had, up to this point, remained undiagnosed and untreated. Through my cultural studies, I gleaned that unconscious biases surrounding mental health in certain socioeconomic regions of Latin America may have been a root cause for James’ delayed diagnosis and thus treatment. I separately communicated this to the medical team who verified my presumption and referred the patient to more specialized care. My experience taught me that education and collaboration within a medical team is a powerful tool in combating implicit biases and ensuring positive outcomes for patients. 

Working alongside the medical students at the clinic gave me insight into the commitment and diligence required to become a compassionate and competent physician, which I have vigorously taken on as my own aspiration. I further gained insight into the value of physician-patient connections when my family and I were seeking medical care for my father’s spinal stenosis, which had been progressing and was causing him debilitating pain. Having consulted numerous neurosurgery and orthopedic specialists, I was marked by one visit in particular. As I sat in the chair by my father’s side, I watched the physician enter the room and face my father. He began masterfully extracting pertinent details from the HPI as my father - a notoriously taciturn man - recounted his experience with his symptoms and debilitations. Dr. Burke proceeded to educate rather than lecture my father about the various treatment options at his disposal. His demeanor made my family and I feel at ease and trust that my father’s condition was now being managed by considerate and able hands. I vowed to always approach all patient encounters throughout my career in a similar manner.

My patient care endeavors have set a precedent for how I plan to critically and thoughtfully contribute to the medical profession. I also aim to contribute to the advancement of medicine through research. My experience in my neurology lab has impacted the way I think about the mundane conditions of our health and abilities. My research team and I developed and tested nanopatterned microelectrodes that allow direct control of a prosthetic limb while greatly reducing the foreign body reaction. Through every impassioned investigation and meticulous exploration, we arrive one step closer to actualizing a reality where vitality is attainable by all. I am now confident that our innovations in laboratory techniques, our careful observation and applications of biomimetics in a variety of unlikely scenarios, and most of all, our determination for inquiry and adaptability have the potential to thoroughly rectify conditions previously thought to be unconditionally constraining.

By intertwining the objects of my fascination, I have discovered that the complexity and variety of human communication is a paramount constituent of scientific inquiry and healing. There exists an unmistakable likeness between how musicians orchestrate a plethora of elements - from the artistic decision-making and synergy throughout the piece - and how clinicians and surgeons orchestrate their own symphony in the clinic and operating room. Applying myself to music, language, and service, I have gained the adaptability and resilience that I am compelled to embody while caring for patients. What I hear in Edouard Lalo’s “Symphonie Espagnole,” is beauty that I can also see and touch. The intricacy of its harmonized melodies are characterized by a stimulating complexity, one that is mirrored in my lifelong pursuit - a fine art composed of the most harmonious instrument: the human body.","I spent five years of my childhood in Lebanon, a country with many different faces. To the media, it is a war-stricken country in the midst of ongoing conflict; to historians, an archeological phenomenon; and to sociologists, proof that a myriad of different religions can coexist. My cherished memories of Beirut instilled in me a yearning to discover what my country's history means to me. Through this ongoing introspective discovery, I have gained a deeper understanding of myself and an ability to recognize insecurities in others and address them with empathy and understanding._x000D_

The differences each of us portrays allows for the expression of a diversity of thoughts, ideas, and experiences. In everything that I dedicate myself to, I make decisions that help me attain this mindset. At Rush Medical College, I aspire to apply my willingness to appreciate differences to my interactions with my peers and to my future delivery of care, by listening to others as they tell their story.","I was able to measurably impact several communities across different cities through the Kidney Disease Screening and Awareness Program. Kidney disease is a common and chronic condition which often presents without symptoms. Our goal was to provide accessible testing and education in prevention and care management in medically underserved communities, specifically in bustling cities where many health issues may be neglected. We encouraged patients to take charge of their health; during follow-up, our patients reported changes in their diet, exercise, and lifestyle habits. Overall, we innovated in the way that people receive and seek out healthcare, and in the way they perceive their health - as something tangible to be managed. Through this experience, I have learned skills that I hope to apply in furthering the mission of the Rush Medical College by incorporating education and epidemiology into the strategies for achieving improved health and wellness in the Chicago community.",,,1,"The hardships faced by marginalized communities became apparent to me during the COVID-19 outbreak through my role as a Spanish interpreter to patients with limited English proficiency at the University of Michigan Student-Run Free Clinic.

Confronting uncertainty, I evolved my approach by maintaining a therapeutic patient-provider relationship. Even though I volunteered at the clinic since my freshman year, the spread of COVID-19 illuminated a variety of healthcare aspects that I was previously unaware of.

Once I began attending higher educational institutions, I needed to take loans out and look for any scholarship available in order to pay for schooling. I received the Pell Grant while in college and am still taking loans out to pay for my schooling. In my hometown, my home is located in a lower socioeconomic location in the city. The areas around me are surrounded by violence and crime and I've grown accustomed to hearing the sirens of police and ambulances going by my house every night.

BEEP! BEEP! Our duty phone had just gone off. It was my first call as an EMT. I trained extensively for this but, now that it had arrived, a wave of nervousness came over me. Despite my nervousness I was ready to act and do what needed to be done, which was getting to the patient and giving them the care they needed. Upon arrival, the patient was lying on the floor moaning in agony. I made first contact, immobilizing their cervical spine to prevent further injury. The patient’s head was just 6-inches from a brick wall, so I maneuvered between the patient and the wall to take the spinal precaution properly. In doing this, I could see fear in the patient’s eyes. I told them “Don’t worry, we got you.” With those simple words, relief visibly swept over the patient's face, and a simple smile conveyed the trust they had given me. I continued talking with them as we waited for transport to higher medical care. Despite its brevity, this interaction has taught me about the importance of human connection in medicine. Sometimes, what matters more is showing the patient how much you care rather than how much you know. This is something I strive to keep with me as I venture further into medicine.

Medicine has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I was born with a heart condition diagnosed as a “Single-Left Ventricle.” Because of this, I had three open-heart surgeries by the time I was 2 years old. This already difficult experience was amplified by the negative outlooks given to my parents and I. “Don't get too attached to your son, he isn’t going to live long.” “None of these operations matter, he’s going to need a new heart anyway.” “Don’t sign your son up for any sports, he won’t be able to play.” However, I decided that my diagnosis was not going to determine the outlook of my life. With the help of my family and my doctors, I was able to beat the odds and overcome all of these negative prognoses. I did continue living with the same heart, and through hard work, commitment, and dedication, I was able to play baseball up to the collegiate level. My heart condition has taught me how to overcome the hardships of life, regardless of the projections of others. Most importantly, it has also given me perspective on the patient’s side of medicine. I’ve experienced sitting in a hospital for weeks, having strangers enter your room and take blood, run tests and ask you personal questions you feel obligated to answer. I understand the vulnerability and dependency patients feel when they’re sick or hurt, having to rely on others to help them. This perspective allows me to shape my style of care to advocate for my patients and form strong relationships that empower them in their treatment.

Despite my lifelong connection, I did not initially choose to go into medicine. While having some idea of becoming a doctor, being a first-generation college student, lacking resources and connections, led me to limit my career-path options. I initially chose to major in electrical engineering not through my true desires, but through the tainted lens that I viewed myself. As I found myself unsatisfied with my current goals, I met with counselors to speak about my preliminary idea of becoming a doctor. They would ask “are you running away from something or running towards something?” Looking back, I can confidently say that I was running towards something, my dream of becoming a doctor. As I went through this transformation, I chose to switch majors and transfer schools. Almost immediately following my decision I began to feel an inner happiness that changed my entire perspective on my education and life. My study habits changed, and I began receiving higher grades. I began reaching out to organizations around me and got more involved in my community. I began to see my pursuit of becoming a doctor as the potential for me to give to others the same way that I was given to as a child. This idea brings me unexplainable happiness and satisfaction and I use it to bring me strength and drive as I venture through this journey.

It has been four years since I made my decision to pursue becoming a physician and I have not had any regret since. This journey has given me many experiences, opportunities and connections that have made me sure that I have chosen the right path. From volunteering at RotaCare Bay Area free medical clinics connecting financially struggling people to healthcare to volunteering at Golden State Orthopedics and Spine getting patients ready for the intimidating process of surgery and recovery, and even being the first line of defense for my community as an EMT. I’ve been a shoulder to cry on for a patient who hurt their back and could no longer work despite being the only source of income for their family, a source of strength for a patient experiencing a mental health crisis from the hardships of life, a support system for a young boy terrified of the scary saws that are used to take off casts. I cherish all of these experiences, and they have proven to me time and again that becoming a doctor is the right path for me. Medicine is my way of giving back to the community, advocating for people in need, and making true connections. This is a lifelong commitment and that’s exactly what I want from medicine.","Growing up, I lived in an underserved, low income community that surrounded me with an immense amount of diversity. So much so that the high school I attended had a 92% minority enrollment rate, which allowed me to be surrounded by others from different backgrounds. Having this experience so early in life enabled me to understand the importance of making connections with people from different backgrounds, and how learning about a person‚Äôs culture, religion or heritage, can help you to become a more open and well-rounded person. One experience in particular that enhanced my ability to understand those unlike myself was learning about Hawaiian culture. I was completely unaware of such different traditions, especially a place part of the U.S. This experience taught me not to prematurely judge any one‚Äôs background and culture. I have kept these lessons thus far in my life and still make it a point to learn as much as I can about the people around me.","Two of my most impactful experiences that entailed helping my surrounding community would be volunteering at RotaCare Bay Area and Believers in Christ. Both of these experiences allowed me to lend a helping hand to individuals in need. Rotacare was a free medical clinic for the people of San Jose who were unable to afford a hospital visit due to lack of insurance or any other financial barriers. Although I did not directly serve as a medical provider, helping the clinic run in a quick and efficient manner meant more people were receiving much needed care. I took my role very seriously and put forth my best effort to help the patient‚Äôs visiting the clinic. Believers in Christ was a program that fed unhoused people every Sunday. I was able to form many connections and friendships with the people I served, and I found it to be extremely rewarding. I feel that these two experiences are examples of how I made an impact in my community helping people receive healthcare and warm meals.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic began at the end of my first year at Santa Clara University, just as I was starting to solidify myself in organizations and volunteering opportunities. I lost a year as an active EMT, a clinic I was volunteering at shutdown, I was unable to tutor in person and I could not be a peer educator in person for the incoming first-generation transfer students. Although I was able to contribute to these activities online, it took away many of the personal connections that I strive to make. My research grant was also pushed back a year. This caused me a domino effect of problems. I had initially planned to solely study for the MCAT during the 2021 summer, however my research project was pushed into this summer and I was forced to balance studying with a full-time research project. This impacted my studying greatly and resulted in me having to push back the MCAT, which would continuously cause me problems as I was never able to give my sole focus to studying for the exam.",0,1,2

I swung my arms, creating waves with my long white skirt, while the drummer synchronized his rhythm to mine. The annual ""Semana de Puerto Rico,"" a time to celebrate and reflect on the history of our home island, included a lesson on Bomba, our oldest musical genre. In Bomba, the dancer tells the story while the percussionist amplifies and supports, nurturing respect between muse and musician. This bond shapes my vision of the physician I aspire to become: a doctor who listens to and respects each patient's story. In the last few years, three individuals' poignant stories have played a pivotal role in my decision to study medicine and provide healthcare to underserved communities.

My heart raced as I listened to Figueroa's slurred words on the phone. I was back home from college when Figueroa, a security guard whom I have known since I was young, had suffered a stroke. He was referred to a psychiatrist to help him cope with his disability rather than a neurologist to prevent a worsening of his pathology due to the scarcity of physicians accepting ""La Reforma,"" the Puerto Rican term for Medicaid. In order to grant him more appropriate care, my neighbors and I gathered funds for his neurologist appointment — it was not unusual for me to get involved in my community; I often visited a local women's shelter and volunteered at the local public school as a French teacher every Friday after classes. Unfortunately, several days after Figueroa's call, we learned that he had suffered a second stroke that left him partially paralyzed. Although there was immense value in our grassroots organizing, it alone could not prevent Figueroa's second stroke. Growing up, I witnessed how inadequate medical care in Puerto Rico can be, and while studying in Maine and subsequently living in New England, I found that an efficient way to spread awareness of the inequalities faced by Puerto Ricans was to share individual experiences of hardship, such as Figueroa's. When local musicians popularized Bomba, they amplified lost voices and shared the stories of their ancestors: tales of oppression and resilience. To similarly elevate stories of struggle, I co-hosted the Puerto Rico Series on the ""All Alone with Something to Say"" podcast that reached audiences unfamiliar with the island's plights, and created an online platform to share experiences of injustice with my colleagues, family, and friends.

My desire to help marginalized individuals enduring medical hardships led me to Project Healthcare at the NYU Bellevue Hospital Emergency Department, where I volunteered as a patient advocate at a safety-net hospital in which 80 percent of patients come from medically underserved populations. For five consecutive days, I stood beside Karina, a Hispanic woman suffering from severe abdominal pain. We shared stories in our native tongue, which provided her with comfort and a sense of community. When we were not conversing, she spoke to a phone held up by her physician. The interpreter’s voice at the other end of the line asked her questions and repeated her answers in English, impairing the patient-physician bond. Karina reached for my hand as her doctors huddled outside her curtain, and I yearned to be part of the discussion to ease her pain while also allowing her to share her own story.
 
A couple of weeks after Karina was discharged, I sat beside James, a man roughly my age who reminisced about his childhood in Jamaica and confided in me as he shared his struggles to sustain his mother and sister in a new country. On the fourth day of my shift, I learned he had been sent back to Riker's Island, where he was awaiting his trial. Despite his status as an incarcerated immigrant, I wished to establish the same relationship I had formed with my previous patients, even if some of my colleagues discouraged me from doing so. My encounter with James thus expanded my vision of advocacy and caretaking to encompass marginalized individuals beyond my immediate community.

As a child, I learned that without the dancer there is no Bomba. Years later, I realized that Figueroa, Karina, and James are the dancers who drive the beat of the intimate bond that is the patient-physician relationship. These three experiences have convinced me that medicine is the path I want to pursue in order to alleviate suffering stemming from health inequities and provide proper care to any patient who seeks medical treatment. My career as a physician will only be fulfilled if I can additionally provide medical care in safety-net clinics like Bellevue Hospital. I will treat patients with limited financial resources like Figueroa, patients who overuse emergency services when their medical conditions become exacerbated, such as Karina, and socially stigmatized individuals like James. My goal is to be a physician who amplifies every patient's voice and addresses their health needs with empathy and respect, just as the percussionist elevates the dancer, and just as Bomba empowers my community.","I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, my mother's hometown, but spent my first seven years in France where I grew up speaking Spanish and French. My father then moved our family to California to grant us the opportunity to obtain an American education, one he wished he had received growing up in the remote Moroccan countryside. A couple of years later, my family relocated to a suburb of San Juan. A Puerto Rican girl tasked with learning academic Spanish at 11 years old, I felt a unique need to earn my place culturally, and with adequate resources, I was successful within the academic year. However, I promptly noticed that in Puerto Rico, many public school students do not have the opportunity to learn foreign languages. As a result, in middle and high school, I taught French to at-risk teenagers at the local community center every Friday. Since then, I have continuously pursued volunteer work as a form of advocacy and am now eager to support vulnerable communities through medicine.","At the Bellevue Hospital Emergency Ward, I met a young man named James who spoke endearingly about his sister and mother. He provided for them after his father passed away prior to their immigration to the U.S. He had a hard life but a gracious outlook, sharing his dream of becoming a pilot. When a nurse suggested I stay away from James, as he was awaiting his trial at Rikers Island prison, I respectfully reminded her that he was deemed non-violent by the police officer and that my duty as a patient advocate was to grant him the same treatment I was providing other patients. James later told me he was taken to the ED after a suicide attempt, and that I was the first person to engage in non-medical conversation with him. I wondered how the social isolation and stigmatization could have adversely affected his delicate mental condition. Although briefly, I provided him a space to be vulnerable and granted him companionship, which he acknowledged was lacking in his everyday life in prison.",,,1,"At the start of the pandemic, I returned home to Puerto Rico to continue my pre-medical studies remotely. I volunteered to make face shields with a 3D printer at my former high school and distributed the equipment to first responders across the island. Later during the lockdown I baked and sold bread, donating the funds to Instituto Santa Ana, a home for young girls who have been victims of abuse. In late summer, my grandmother passed away, so we traveled to France to pay our respects. This loss was difficult to process since we were unable to embrace her in her final moments and our mourning process, a time to traditionally reunite with family and friends from France and Morocco, was interrupted. The pandemic has pushed me to find ways to help my community during times of suffering, a skill I will keep developing as a medical student and physician. I have learned that especially during seemingly hopeless times, even a small benevolent act of support can foster healing and recovery.",1,1,3

She called my name, and the focus shifted to me. As a fourth-grade student, I felt humiliated to not be able to read. While my classmates devoured Harry Potter, I struggled through Captain Underpants. At home, my mother painstakingly organized fun activities to practice my reading: I played word games for M&M’s and read flashcards in alto and soprano. It took considerable effort, but by sixth grade, I had caught up to my peers and was on my way to becoming an A student. The interventions of those supporting me, as well as my own determination, were key to my success. Ever since then, I have wanted to support others on their own journeys. Through my patient care experiences as an intern at a medical center, emergency medical technician (EMT), and clinical researcher, I have discovered that medicine is a career that would allow me to do this and in which I would thrive.
 
As an intern at Tufts Medical Center, I met “John,” a 15-year-old eczema patient enrolled in a biologic drug clinical trial after 10 years of failed treatments. John’s discomfort and desquamation were so severe that he was homeschooled and wore towels, as they chafed less than shirts. John was worn down by his condition and its impact on his quality of life, which was not helped when little to no improvement was noted weeks into the trial. Through my attempts to make John more comfortable, I discovered that he played Subway Surfers on his phone, which sparked a friendly months-long competition between us. As I watched John open up and grow more optimistic about the clinical trial, I realized that I enjoyed building long-term relationships with patients. With support from me, the clinical team, and his family, John stayed in the trial and was re-randomized; his eczema cleared almost entirely by the following summer. I saw how my relationship and rapport with John contributed to his positive medical outcome, and I saw how gratifying this aspect of being a doctor would be for me. 

My experiences as a Tufts EMT further solidified my desire to build strong relationships with patients and exposed me to the complex problem solving involved in medical encounters. During an EMT shift, I was dispatched to an 18-year-old female who was having an anxiety attack because her cycle was late after having consensual but unprotected intercourse. Her physical assessment indicated no major concerns, but I was troubled when my patient admitted she lacked friends, thought she had an undiagnosed anxiety disorder, and received an abstinence-only sex education. I did not feel comfortable leaving this patient alone with her spiraling anxiety, so I recommended she seek more urgent care. Through this and other patient care encounters, I found that the challenge of gathering information, weighing evidence, and making an appropriate decision motivates me to pursue a career in medicine. I feel satisfaction when solving a patient’s puzzle and contributing to their improved well-being, and this feeling motivates me to be a physician who strives to provide the best care to each unique patient. 

A non-clinical situation where I worked to find solutions to patients’ needs was when conducting research and interning in the Severe Asthma Clinic (SAC) at Boston Children’s Hospital. The SAC aims to improve care coordination by providing patients access to multi-specialty clinical care in a single location and coordinated manner. I participated in the study design and data acquisition of a project that aimed to acquire funding for each patient in the SAC to have private social work appointments scheduled during each clinic visit. I consented study participants, coordinated participants completing a questionnaire assessing anxiety or depression symptoms, and analyzed the data for correlations between reported anxiety or depression symptoms and asthma control indicators. My biggest takeaway from this project was seeing the collaborative nature of research and clinical medicine. It was bolstering to witness the support between providers and reassuring to know that as a physician, I would be able to obtain assistance if a patient’s needs exceeded my area of expertise. As someone who prides herself on being a resource to her team members, I also look forward to the opportunity to share my knowledge with others when they need it. I thrive in collaborative situations and working with the SAC showed me that medicine would be a strong match for me.

I know how challenging it is to struggle, and how life-changing it can be to overcome those struggles. As a doctor, I would look forward to the reward of knowing my efforts have led to the increased well-being of others. Whether it is playing Subway Surfers to build rapport, being perceptive and flexible with a complex patient, or supporting a team working to provide comprehensive healthcare, my passion is individualized patient care. I will be a successful physician because I will identify and treat my patients’ diverse medical, emotional and social needs, while working closely with other providers on the care team. My disposition to go above and beyond for patients is the distinction that will lead to my overall success.","Growing up, my parents valued diversity, so we celebrated Ramadan, Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa, and Chinese New Year. This upbringing has provided me with a platform to connect with people and made me value diversity. For example, I was a member of a research group comprised of twelve young women of various backgrounds and religions. Sharing my own family‚Äôs traditions, I took the lead in ensuring that everyone felt comfortable talking about their own cultural experiences. Being raised in a primarily white, Christian, middle-class community, it would have been difficult for me to connect with diverse individuals if not for my parents‚Äô traditions. For example, as an EMT, I was better equipped to advise a fasting Muslim woman during Ramadan after she fainted because I recognize the traditions of the holy month and could relate to her experience. As a medical student, I will use my diverse upbringing to connect with my peers and patients, so people feel more comfortable and included.","In the Severe Asthma Clinic (SAC) at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, I conducted research testing the hypothesis that symptoms of anxiety or depression are highly prevalent in pediatric severe asthma patients and negatively affect asthma control. The goal of the project was to provide evidence of the correlation and to petition the hospital for more funding for social work interventions in the SAC. Many of the young patients who participated in the study had such severe conditions that they could not play on youth sports teams. Those same children often noted not being compliant with their medication regimen due to feelings of helplessness and lack of motivation. After completing the research and proving the correlation, it was incredibly gratifying to know that my work impacted the SAC patient community by providing these children with the social work resources they needed to cope with their chronic illness, improving their mental health and hopefully, in turn, their physical health.",,,1,"With online learning induced by the pandemic, I graduated early and became a medical assistant in January of 2021. Therefore, I experienced the positive and negative ways the pandemic impacted the healthcare system, which in turn contributed to my own career goals. I witnessed significantly more vaccination sites being placed in wealthy suburbs, compared to densely populated marginalized communities in the city. Yet, I also saw the enhancement of telehealth technology. Wheelchair-bound individuals no longer had to leave their homes for appointments, and virtual medical translators were accessible in minutes. The pandemic highlighted the issue of health equity, sparking my interest in exploring the topic further. At Rush Medical College, I would apply for the Health Equity and Social Justice Leadership Program where I would gain the knowledge and skills to advocate for health equity and make care more accessible through technological advancements and equitable resource distribution.",0,0,1

Despite what would be her final attempt to sway me toward the culinary arts, I was hardly inspired. Medical dramas, not cooking shows, had long been the staple of my media diet. My expectations for a career built on well-timed epiphanies and risky interventions were set in place by an episode of House, MD, in which the eponymous physician convinces his team that their patient has a rare form of paralysis called locked-in syndrome. The opening scene ends as Dr. House stares into the patient's near-lifeless eyes and says ""Oh, this is going to be fun"".
Television's tendency to glamorize every encounter in medicine left me ill-prepared when I finally found myself shadowing a surgeon at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center as a college freshman. The first case I witnessed that day, the excision of a pilonidal cyst, excited me as a clinically inexperienced student, but humbled the naive teenager in me who had envisioned a day filled with only the most high-stakes operations. Dr. Mancini, the attending physician, allowed me to stand just outside the sterile field throughout the case, eagerly welcoming my questions and quizzing me on anatomy in between explanations of how to properly hold instruments. I had no doubt that he had performed thousands of procedures just like this one, and yet, he seemed to share in the sense of novelty that I felt as a student watching a surgery for the very first time. In showcasing his craft, Dr. Mancini was invigorated by the role of a mentor that could perhaps distinguish a given case from the many technically identical ones he had done in the past. I began to notice that teaching was integral to Dr. Mancini's profession when he handed his needle driver to the resident standing opposite him and watched closely as she sealed the surgical defect with the final sutures. As she took over and finished the case, the distinction between student and colleague became more fluid; in this instance, teaching and learning appeared to be an act of partnership.
My interest in medicine found a new motivation: being a doctor entailed not only treating illness, but also fostering a learning environment where seasoned experts and their juniors could temporarily become equals in order to safely transfer skill and knowledge. I felt less intimidated by the seeming vastness and complexity of a physician's duties, knowing that their mastery comes from this kind of a joint effort where building mutual trust is the cornerstone of collaboration between a teacher and a student.
The camaraderie that was essential to mentorship in medicine was not lost on me when I spent four weeks shadowing a urologist named Dr. Steckel, who treated me as a member of his team by involving me in nearly every patient visit. He emphasized the patient's perspective in the exam room, creating a relaxed atmosphere where unpressured face-to-face interaction prevailed over clinical jargon. A casual, caring demeanor seemed natural to Dr. Steckel as he met each patient at eye level and shared stories about his personal life. Still, I always struggled to describe the concrete elements that formed a trusting bond between a physician and a patient.
When I joined a dermatology clinic as a medical assistant after college, I realized that patients were not always receptive to the compassionate gestures that I emulated from my prior mentors, like sitting down and mirroring their posture. I eventually came to understand that an empathetic approach was not a uniform pattern of actions, but rather an individualized response to a person's emotional needs; a patient would often benefit from having these addressed before their medical concerns. When an elderly woman named Kitty presented with painful blisters all over her body—apparently suffering a recurrence of bullous pemphigoid after years of failed treatments—I found myself trying to model composure and empathy in front of a newly hired assistant in training. As Kitty refused to answer even the most basic of intake questions, her intense scowl signaled a need to unleash frustration, and so I grabbed a stool and listened quietly until she regained calm. Although I was used to what teaching looked like in an academic setting, the task of demonstrating the emotional subtleties of patient communication in the clinic was especially challenging because I could not explain them in words to my trainee. Unlike the tutoring that I had done throughout college, the unwritten curriculum of empathy required learning through observation and experimentation. The notion of lifelong studentship in medicine began to make more sense to me as I played the role of a teacher for a skill in which I had not yet become proficient myself.
My exposure to real clinical situations has opened my eyes to the unexpected duality of the physician as both a healer and an educator. Whereas my initial excitement for medicine stemmed largely from the misguided thrill of managing constant life-or-death scenarios, I now also look forward to the collegiality of the learning and teaching process that is embedded in the physician's career.","When I joined other undergraduates on a trip to Israel four years ago, I hoped to explore undiscovered parts of my Jewish heritage by immersing myself in the arts, language, and cuisine that honored those roots.

Arriving in the Negev desert, my group was welcomed into a Bedouin village, a semi-permanent home to the land‚Äôs nomadic people. As we settled into an open tent and enjoyed dinner around a table without chairs or utensils, we learned about the Bedouins‚Äô way of life, which was built on relocation and adaptation. Their hospitality and their mastery of the arid environment embodied harmony, and I felt humbled to imagine a life in which not even shelter could be taken for granted. Largely isolated from the innovation-driven world around it, this community taught me a different kind of luxury, in which unity with nature and with each other exemplified a level of fulfillment that technology could not provide.","As a teenager, I was used to having unpopular opinions at the dinner table. As the first in my family to be born in the United States, I had long perceived that my community, consisting mostly of Soviet immigrants, was resistant to the more progressive ideas on gender and sexuality that I had adopted throughout my upbringing. Coming out as gay forced me to challenge prejudices at home, and taught me the power of open dialogue in changing people‚Äôs minds. _x000D_

I leveraged my roles in community service to underpin difficult conversations with my family. Volunteering as a crisis counselor, an admissions essay coach, and an organizer of Dartmouth‚Äôs Medicine and Justice Scholars program, I came across firsthand accounts of sexual and gender minorities‚Äô journeys to establishing their identities. Sharing their stories with my parents compelled them to become more accepting of those who present differently. In turn, I learned to be a better advocate for groups whose voices are often diminished.",,,1,"Prior to the pandemic, I structured my academic plan to include a six-month window after junior year that would be free of classes, allowing me to pursue extracurricular activities full-time. By the Winter term of 2020, I had secured two consecutive internships to take place during my time off, the first one in urology research and the second in clinical work at a burn center in Nepal.

2023,15223902,,23,Woman,USA,0,,0,1,"I grew up in the underserved area of East Los Angeles and attended low-performing public schools prior to matriculating to college.

As my parents took non-traditional pathways to higher education, I navigated college mostly independently and without someone’s example to follow. Due to my parents’ limited income, I made an effort to find work-study jobs and paid summer internships that would allow me to pay for my education and personal expenses. The limited educational preparation I received in high school led to me struggling to keep up with the rigorous academic demands I faced in college. While I initially struggled to maintain my grades, I developed better study habits by attending office hours and collaborating with others.

As I walked with my supervisor to the patient’s room, I felt my worries mount against me. This patient had just recently triggered for delirium, and I was to spend at least 45 minutes helping stimulate her cognitive function through a non-medical intervention. Upon entering her dimly lit hospital room and seeing the patient fast asleep in a sea of blankets, I wondered by what authority was I to be attempting to interact with these patients. As a large motivation for me to enter the medical field was the opportunity to build relationships with patients, I worried about my ability to effectively build these connections. My nervous thoughts were put on pause as my supervisor walked me through the usual steps I was to take upon visiting a patient. I opened the room’s blinds and gently woke the patient to introduce myself and let her know that I’d be spending some time with her. 

With the patient awake, I began to ask the usual questions we ask to get to know patients better. As she told me she grew up in the South and was born in Trinidad, I recognized just how different our experiences were. However, I soon realized how exciting it was to have so much to learn about someone who has lived a life so different from mine. I heard all about how New York was during her youth and the foods she loved to cook. While I had entered her room knowing only of her illness, I now knew more about her as a person and how her illness had affected her life. Through building this connection with her, I began to see my desire to pursue a career in medicine confirmed. As I saw how this once-asleep patient laying in a dimly lit hospital room was now awake and alert, I also recognized how establishing these connections and engaging patients in conversation are vital in improving a patient’s health outcomes. As I continued to meet many more patients for the first time, my worries over this first encounter dissipated. I grew increasingly confident in my ability to modify my approach to an intervention based on a patient’s symptoms. For example, with patients experiencing greater cognitive decline and paranoia, I focused on reorienting them to their environment and building trust. 

While each shift was a learning opportunity, I also had the opportunity to teach patients’ families how they could be involved in the patient’s care. Similar to my own worries when I started volunteering, many families doubted their ability to treat and prevent symptoms of delirium. There were several times when the children of patients expressed doubt over their parent’s ability to engage in the intervention. It was heart-warming to see their faces light up upon hearing their names when I asked the patient to list the names of their children. By modeling how to reorient the patient to their environment, I was able to help family members feel more capable of involving themselves in the patient’s care. The teaching aspect of being a Delirium volunteer was highly rewarding as I got to empower patients and their families to feel a sense of agency in their health. During the instances in which I was able to revisit patients during subsequent shifts, I witnessed firsthand their improvement and the impact that frequent cognitive stimulation has had on their health and the ease of their family members. The experience of facilitating interventions has motivated me to continue working towards being a physician so that I can put into practice the process of making healthcare personalized to a patient and involving family in care. 

Along with patients whose experiences differed from my own, I also met patients who were not so different from myself. As one of the few Spanish-speaking volunteers on the team, I worked closely with Latinx patients. While I shared in my culture with many of them, I also learned about how multifaceted Latinx identity is and how there is always more for me to learn about the communities that I serve. With the rewards of getting to interact with patients, also came instances in which I didn’t feel satisfied with the care that I was able to provide to them. Along with some patients simply not wanting to engage, I saw how many patients, especially Latinx patients, were distrustful of me and other hospital staff because of previous negative experiences with healthcare. Hearing their frustrations over the lack of Spanish-speaking staff and the healthcare system at large echoed the frustrations I’ve heard from my own family members that have been hospitalized. While I ensured these patients that they were in good hands and that I empathized with their perspectives, these experiences have further motivated me to enter the medical field so that I can advocate for underserved communities. 

I’ve come to recognize that as an individual, I will always be just one part of a patient’s healthcare experience. From the social determinants of health to other individuals involved in their care, a patient’s healthcare experience has many aspects to it. I hope to continue learning how to navigate this as a physician. I’m excited for the collaboration and challenges that approaching healthcare with this perspective will bring.","When I moved to NYC for college, I aimed to get involved in the local community. I began volunteering as a high school health educator and thought that as a Latina, I would easily connect to the largely Black and Latinx student population. However, being of Mexican descent, I realized I had much to learn about the Puerto Rican and Dominican cultures that so many of my students identified with. My students taught me more about their identities through insightful discussions. While I thought our backgrounds would be similar as BIPOC individuals who grew up in urban cities, I realized that it was unfair to assume I understood the needs and culture of this community without first engaging in a dialogue with its members. While I hope to advocate for patient needs as a physician, I will ensure that the needs I address have been community-identified. I hope to draw on my experience in immersing myself in new communities to positively impact the health of a diverse patient population at Rush.","As a Waiting Room As a Literacy and Learning Environment (WALLE) intern, I helped connect underserved patients in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York with community resources.

One of my most memorable experiences with WALLE was when while trying to reach a patient, the phone was answered by her daughter. The daughter confided in me that she was struggling to afford the nutritious foods she was told would be best for her mother‚Äôs health. Through WALLE, I was able to log her needs and help connect her with community resources. I am grateful that we had created a partnership between the hospital and community organizations to connect patients with the appropriate resources. This experience motivated me to continue addressing the social determinants of health and to ensure partnerships between clinics and community services exist for other underserved patients.",,,1,"After leaving my college campus due to the rise in COVID-19 cases, it was difficult to engage in clinical volunteer opportunities at home as my local hospital had suspended its volunteer program. It was not until I returned to campus that I began volunteering with the Delirium Program at Mount Sinai Hospital.

I recognized the impact that positive interactions with hospital staff can have on a patient‚Äôs health. _x000D_

While I wanted nothing more than to be at my mom’s side while she was there, I could not help but feel a jolt of anxiety any time the alarms on her machines would sound. I nervously waited for a team of doctors to rush in and fix the problem, only to be reassured that she was not in danger – an IV line was just tangled. After months of watching my mom’s hair fall out and her energy drain, I felt immense relief when she came home after her final surgery for Stage IV appendix cancer. We were lucky she was diagnosed in 2013, just two years after the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) began offering HIPEC surgery. We were even luckier to have a team of physicians with the skills to recommend and perform this innovative cancer therapy. As I sat with my mom in her oncologist’s office years later, she tearfully thanked her doctor for giving her the chance to see her daughters graduate from high school. I thought about how a person that I hardly knew had helped save my mom's life, something I would never be able to fully thank her for. While I did not understand all that went into becoming a physician at the time, I admired the competence and compassion of this doctor and hoped to one day be like her. With this goal in mind, I sought out opportunities during college to learn about medicine and patient care.

While I hope my mom will stay away from HUP, I now find myself every week in the same hospital that once overwhelmed me years ago. As a volunteer in the Family Caregiver Center, I encounter people in similar uncertain circumstances that my own family had endured. One caregiver that comes to mind is Sara, whose husband has throat cancer. As I offer her a coffee, Sara tells me the most recent update. Her husband needs a tracheostomy, another challenge he will need to overcome despite already feeling so powerless. While we talk, I begin to understand more about his diagnosis and the emotional toll this disease takes on him and his entire family.

These conversations with Sara motivated me to learn more about the patient experience. I began working on a project piloting a new communication app on iPads for patients with tracheostomies. The anxiety I once felt from the alarms and fast-paced environment turned into excitement as I walked into the first patient’s room. After giving a tutorial of the app, the patient pointed out he was having difficulty holding the iPad I gave him due to the IVs in his hands. As a result of our conversation, I suggested to the study team that we provide cases that are easier for patients to hold. This small change significantly improved our patients’ experiences. One of the most exciting aspects of becoming a physician is to have clinical interactions with my patients and their families, with the intent to understand what is important to them. With this knowledge, I will be able to amplify their voices in clinical research and adapt their care plan based on their individual needs.

As medicine advances, new technologies, like the HIPEC surgery my mom received and the app my team piloted, can be met with apprehension. Incorporating new tools requires that providers establish trust with their patients. As a clinical research coordinator for the Memories2 research study, I observed how the physician leading the study developed this patient-provider trust. I learned how I could do the same in my own role. One patient, Pam, was interested in joining but expressed hesitation when I informed her that the study required virtual visits due to Covid-19. She did not have a computer and had trouble using the internet. A few minutes into our phone call, Pam became emotional, telling me how she struggled the past year not being able to see her grandkids, who would often help her use technology. After speaking with her for a while about her family and the challenges brought by the pandemic, I offered to mail her a study laptop. I asked her to trust me, telling her I would walk through the process step-by-step as many times as she needed until she felt comfortable. She agreed to this plan. After a few of our sessions, Pam gained the confidence to use technology not only to join our study visits but also to video call her grandkids. I learned that despite spending a short time with Pam, gaining her trust allowed me to make a positive impact on other aspects of her life outside of our study. While my time with patients may be limited as a physician, I hope that the tools I provide to them will be far-reaching.

I want to provide an extraordinary level of guidance and hope to people when they need it most, so I am committed to becoming a physician who embraces innovation and builds relationships rooted in compassion. As I have personally witnessed in my experiences in healthcare, physicians are tasked with making personalized and holistic courses of care for their patients built on trust. I plan to be a physician who not only offers my patients what they need but also provides them with the knowledge to become active and informed participants in their own care. In the meantime, I will continue to offer a listening ear to the patients and caregivers I meet each week to help make their time at the hospital a little less overwhelming.","My undergraduate university emphasized the importance of expanding our worldview beyond our classroom education. From talking with Philadelphians from low-income neighborhoods in my work and volunteering, I better understand the unique challenges that people in urban environments face, such as gun violence and food insecurity. I also took classes that allowed me to interact with people unlike myself. In the course ""Prison Reading Project,"" I was able to talk with individuals who had been in the Philadelphia prison system, and we discussed the lasting effects that incarceration had on their lives. While I may never fully understand the challenges that come with incarceration, I left this course with more compassion and a better understanding of individuals in completely different circumstances than my own. I hope to apply the new ideas and perspectives I gained from the people of Philadelphia to work toward health equity and social justice while at Rush Medical College. ","When the pandemic began, I noticed how cases were skyrocketing in the poorer parts of Philadelphia, followed by increased hospitalizations and deaths. In my job as a clinical coordinator, I talked with many people who were from different areas of Philadelphia, including medically underserved areas. When we began to have more in-person visits, I was required to ask if people had been vaccinated against Covid-19. Rather than just asking the question, I would listen to their concerns about the vaccine or the inability to get tested and share what I learned about the vaccine and the locations that I knew near them that were offering testing and vaccinations. I also volunteered several times with Drexel University‚Äôs vaccine clinics where we helped distribute vaccines to both the Drexel community and residents of West Philadelphia. While I do not have a solution to solve the systemic discrimination in the city, I hoped to provide some Philadelphians the resources to get the care they needed.",,,1,"In 2019, I began two clinical volunteering positions. I planned to be involved with these programs for a year or more, but both programs ended in March 2020 due to Covid-19. Soon after, my university decided to move to virtual learning, and all my courses were only offered online until my fall term of senior year. I had to adapt to this new learning style and find virtual opportunities to stay involved. I did more non-clinical volunteering through Crisis Text Line and Weekly Smile. In terms of research, I had to abandon the project I was working on in the Russell Lab because it required me to be in person. Once I had some training, I started a new project using online bioinformatics tools. While this felt like a setback at first, I appreciated the chance to learn about bioinformatics and it inspired me to pursue it as a minor. Since I could not shadow in person, I found other ways to learn about medicine by joining virtual shadowing sessions and having phone calls with doctors.",1,0,3

My mom has severe asthma, and my dad lived with HCV, so access to adequate healthcare was crucial for our family. When we arrived in California, my family of four lived in a small studio apartment where we all shared one room. My parents worked multiple jobs to gain insurance and provide for our family; I went to school. Attending school in a new country and learning a new language while trying to navigate a starkly different culture often posed many challenges. I could not communicate with my teachers or peers and was constantly teased about my thick accent. As a result, I struggled with my self-confidence and became very quiet. Transitioning into college as a first-generation college student, I struggled with everything from financial aid to my academic course load. Overcoming these challenges, I have developed strength in adversity and have learned to utilize whatever resources are available to me to obtain my goals. In retrospect, my uniqueness as an individual stems from my experiences, and I am incredibly grateful for them.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,6426,214.0,241.0,272.0,1280.0,55.0,1,513,1,1576,05/19/2022,University of California-Irvine,Biology,0,,Yes,No,No,"Less than $25,000",4,1,1,0,10.0,90.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23,Exceptional,4,2023,3,1.0,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"I never thought my dad’s lifelong battle with Hepatitis C would be the seed that would blossom into my passion for medicine. Growing up in a country with limited access to medical resources, I watched my dad struggle to obtain the life-sustaining medication he needed to survive. Not receiving adequate treatment meant constant hemorrhaging, debilitating fatigue, and dangerously high fevers that left him crippled and unable to care for our family. Financial hardships and healthcare disparities brought our family from Egypt to the United States.

Moving to the United States brought “Dr. Hart” into our lives. Dr. Hart was my dad’s infectious disease specialist. I often accompanied my dad to Dr. Hart’s office to help interpret his questions and concerns. Because my dad was unable to clearly voice his needs, I felt an obligation to advocate for him and help relay his concerns. Our journey with Dr. Hart included multiple unsuccessful clinical trials and countless interpreted conversations until 2015. After trying the newest HCV treatment, we visited Dr. Hart to review my dad’s newest test results. “Congratulations, Michael, your HCV antibody test results are negative,” Dr. Hart said, smiling. As I looked at my dad to start interpreting, I saw his facial expression transition from fear to unbelievable relief. I quickly realized this statement needed no interpretation. It was a statement my dad had been dreaming of his whole life. Experiencing that moment and seeing that profound change in my dad deeply resonated with me and ignited a fire in my heart for medicine. Dr. Hart played an instrumental role in giving my dad his life back, and reflection on his impact on both my father’s and our family’s lives greatly intensified my resolve to become a physician. Dr. Hart’s patience and dedication showed me the value of continuity of care in medicine, which I aspire to provide to my future patients, just as Dr. Hart did with my dad.

As I transitioned into college, I discovered a passion for mentoring. I was first introduced to mentoring as a Learning Assistant in Dr. K’s biochemistry class. There, I met “John,” a struggling student who approached me after failing his first exam. As we worked together, I actively listened to John express his fear of not being smart enough and failing. Empathizing, I shared how as a student in Dr.K’s class the prior year, I faced the same dilemma and doubts that I could not rise to the challenge of the course, so much so that I almost dropped the course. I revealed how I also had setbacks during the course but sought out resources, grew further motivated, and worked even harder to eventually succeed. By illuminating the similarities in our struggles and recognizing the triumph at the end, I cultivated hope and empowerment in John to strengthen his resolve and work hard through the quarter. My vulnerability towards John helped us establish a bond of trust that aided our endeavor to his success. Like mentoring, the practice of medicine encompasses more than the application of hard sciences; medicine is about people--their feelings, struggles, and concerns. This experience revealed to me the beauty of connecting with humans and meeting them amidst their struggles; something I hope to do as a physician.

As a volunteer at Hoag Memorial Hospital, I sought to build bonds with my patients as I did with John. Of the many connections I made, some have left a lasting impact on my heart and have cemented my decision to pursue a career as a physician. “Amy,” a long-term patient with a terminal lung cancer diagnosis, was being transferred to hospice. During the weeks leading up to her transfer, I actively checked on Amy even though I was always met with silence and a weary look. Regardless, I would refill her water, get her an extra blanket, and tell her to page me if she needed anything else. I hesitantly yet steadily continued this routine, meeting Amy’s silence every time. It was not until the last day before Amy’s transfer that I realized how my small and often hesitant effort had influenced Amy.

As I did my final rounds, I went into Amy’s room to refill her water cup. Handing her the water, I saw her silently looking at me with tears in her eyes. She hoarsely whispered, “Thank you for your kindness.” Joy flooded my heart as I reached for her hand, smiled, and whispered back, “you are very welcome.” While I couldn’t change Amy’s diagnostic outcome, I felt fortunate to have provided Amy comfort and support in her most vulnerable state, even within my limited scope as a volunteer. This experience reaffirmed my conviction to become a physician; to be a reminding presence for patients that they are more than their physical ailments.

My experiences have increased my dedication to medicine and incited an ever-growing desire to care for others. From my dad’s HCV journey to connecting with John and Amy, I have developed a deeper understanding of humanistic care. My commitment to medicine is motivated by the unique opportunity to serve people in their most vulnerable times of life. Becoming a physician will fulfill my life’s best purposes: establishing trusting relationships, practicing clear and open communication, and embodying my dedication to patients’ health as whole individuals.","As a hospital volunteer, I distinctly remember conversing with one of our patients, Mr. G, who shared that he had been chronically homeless due to a work injury resulting in a permanent disability to his right hand. He then explained how recurrent infections frequently admitted him to hospitals and how the stigma surrounding homelessness often affected his treatment. Diversity encompasses more than race and ethnicity; it includes factors such as housing status. Implicit bias surrounding housing status comes in many forms, however, its impact on healthcare is prominent. Being aware of the existence of these biases is the first step towards identifying and abolishing them. Through this interaction, I have become aware of these biases and have begun to address them through listening and gaining a basic understanding of each person‚Äôs journey. Additionally, I learned that even though people may come from different backgrounds‚Äî most seek connection, compassion, and the chance to be heard.","As a seven-year-old Egyptian immigrant attending school, I faced many challenges and often struggled academically. Through years of perseverance and mentorship, I became fluent in English, excelled academically, and helped new Arabic-speaking students. This experience birthed my passion for mentorship and service as well as inspired my involvement in EASE. As a former EASE student, it was important to me to give back to the program that contributed to my success. My aim as an EASE Peer Coach (EPC) was to be a relatable mentor by sharing my experiences and lessons learned throughout my journey. Consistently working to help my students realize their potential in spite of their struggles, I was delighted to learn that three out of the six newly selected EASE Peer Coaches were former students of mine. During our most recent gathering, I had one student, ‚ÄúMeg,‚Äù share with me that I was the reason she wanted to become a leader and give back to EASE as an EPC.",,,1,"The truth is that human interaction makes me feel replenished. As an extrovert, the pandemic stripped my day of its structure, merged my personal and academic lives, and left me starving for human interaction. This sudden isolation made it difficult to be productive as well as maintain relationships with professors and peers. Adapting, I created systems to separate school and personal activities. To stay connected and active, I set up daily walks with friends, during which we would talk on the phone while exercising. These activities helped structure my day and maintain my social and emotional wellness. Following this routine, I excelled during my last year of college despite the pandemic, and, more importantly, I learned a lot about the various contributing factors of wellness. Experiencing how consequential it can be to care for the elements beyond our physical health has increased my desire to work with underserved communities to help address mental, social, and physical health.",1,0,3

The ever-evolving field of medicine has inspired awe in me, and my interest in it has only grown stronger over time. However, the flame of my passion was truly ignited when my childhood best friend, Katie, went into cardiac arrest in the third grade. After seeing her on the ventilator, I realized I wanted to do everything in my power to ease her pain. I read nearly every book in the local library about the human body. I took notes as the nurses changed her IV bags, and I listened to every word the doctors said about her condition. I wanted to heal Katie; I longed to ease her pain. Healthcare wasn’t just interesting anymore; it was a field that motivated me to learn more every day.

As Katie’s condition stabilized, she was released from the hospital. Though she could breathe on her own, she could not walk or talk. Each day after school, I would go to Katie’s house to care for her in any way I could. I massaged the muscles in her appendages, helped her mother change her feeding bag, and kept her company so that she didn’t feel alone. This time was difficult for both Katie and those who loved her, but it was then I learned that I find joy in taking care of others. Caring for Katie gave me a sense of fulfillment that I could not have imagined. After seeing her improve, watching her smile again, and knowing that I had a small part in that process, I felt gratification that I still carry to this day.

Unfortunately, Katie was not the only person close to me who underwent significant maladies. As I was nearing the end of elementary school, my dad began to experience episodes of extreme joint pain and fatigue. Upon meeting with his doctor, his concerns were minimized, and he was told to return home and simply take naproxen when he wasn’t feeling well. The doctors continued to dismiss my father’s condition until a few weeks later when his symptoms became so severe that he was writhing on the floor in pain. He complained of severe chest tightness, so my mother rushed him to the emergency room. As he was experiencing chest pain, his concerns were taken more seriously than before, and he underwent a myriad of testing. After spending several days in the hospital, an attending physician diagnosed my dad with lupus.

At the time, I thought little of the dismissal of my dad’s symptoms and pain because, in my Mexican-American town, it was common to have underdiagnosed or mistreated ailments. Many of my friends' families had also experienced illnesses for which no treatment had been offered. However, in high school, I learned this treatment stemmed from racial biases in healthcare. I was astonished at the subconscious maltreatment that was happening to minority groups across the country, and I could not help but wonder if my dad would have received treatment earlier had he not been Hispanic. It was then I knew that not only did I want to work in healthcare, but I want to be a physician. I want to lead a medical team in fully assessing my patients' concerns regardless of their race, gender, or socioeconomic status and provide them with better treatment than my father experienced.

However, treating physical ailments is not the only element of holistic patient care. I’ve had my fair share of broken bones, and many people I love have experienced extreme physical illnesses. Yet, high-quality patient care encompasses physical health, mental health, and the intersection between the two. In college, I realized my passion lies in providing care for those with mental illnesses. These diseases are often only visible to those who are afflicted by them, and it is frequently hard for people to find accessible psychiatric care. For this reason, I chose to study psychology and subsequently work at a hospital for pediatric patients with eating disorders. Here, I learned that psychiatrists direct a patient’s care by providing diagnoses and a treatment plan to the patient as well as to the patient’s healthcare team. Due to this, I want to become a psychiatrist so that I may focus my professional efforts on providing care and treatment for those affected by mental illness. As a psychiatrist, I hope to provide effective medical interventions for the mental and physical symptoms associated with these disorders. 

For nearly the last seventeen years, I have been filled with relentless curiosity about the dynamic field of healthcare. Attending medical school allows me to combine the pursuit of my deepest interests with the joy I find in patient care. I want to provide unconditional and empathic treatment so that I can assist people in bettering their mental states. As a physician, I can not only save the life of the next Katie but also ensure that every type of pain people feel, across every demographic, is not ignored.","As a teenager, I began attending a predominantly Black church. Growing up in a largely Mexican-American town, I had little knowledge about the black experience. I joined a Bible study and engaged in conversation with many African-American church members. I heard stories of their upbringings and learned about the traditions of their cultures. During this time, I learned to honor people‚Äôs differences and incorporate their varying perspectives into my life. _x000D_
_x000D_
Years later, I helped build a home for a young, African-American mother. At the building site, she told me about her tragic encounters with racism. Later, she explained how she overcame hardships and advocated for herself. This taught me that although I may never encounter what some demographics must endure, I can respect the difficulties they have faced and serve as an empathetic outlet for others. As a physician, I will acknowledge the disparities in healthcare and work to undo systemic racism in my own practice and beyond.","As the Diversity and Inclusion Chair of Hoof‚Äôn‚ÄôHorn musical theatre, I led the organization in choosing plays for our upcoming season. As I reviewed the suggestions from the general body, I saw musicals of various genres and cast sizes. However, I noticed one fallacy. All of the suggested plays depicted the narratives of white, middle-class Americans. I explained that we needed to select plays with diverse narratives, and I tasked each club member with finding one alternative suggestion that presented a more diverse story, whether it be in terms of race, sexuality, or socioeconomic status. One week later, I heard a myriad of new suggestions, and in effect, we presented a season that included shows such as The Color Purple and In the Heights, musicals that portray black and Latinx narratives respectively. Now, Hoof‚Äôn‚ÄôHorn musical theatre intentionally selects musicals with diverse characters and content so that every member of the audience and cast has a place in the performing arts.",,,1,"Because of COVID-19, almost all in-person shadowing and clinical experiences were halted. Although since the beginning of the pandemic I have only been able to shadow in person twice, virtual shadowing allowed me to shadow doctors from various locations and unique specialties. In this way, the pandemic forced me to seek more diverse shadowing experiences and allowed me to learn more than would have been necessarily possible if I only shadowed doctors in my location. Similarly, the clinical experiences that remained available during the pandemic were those that were integral to the patient experience, such as hospice volunteering. This allowed me to take advantage of clinical experiences that would most strengthen my understanding of the many facets of the healthcare environment. Consequently, COVID-19 taught me to make the best of unforeseen situations, and it also inspired me to be more open-minded and explore many career paths during medical school.",1,0,3

At just six years old, I knew something was off. There was no way my dad was serious. This wasn’t the time for “pedal to the medal,” not as we were approaching the busiest cross street of the Burke Gillman Trail, which served as our weekly turnaround point and a pit stop for a popsicle. This was the first moment when I knew something was different. It was the first of many times when I was the ‘parent.’ But this was not always the case; there was a time when my dad was far more capable.
	September 1986: My dad, an ED physician in Everett, WA, received the incoming trauma no one wants to hear: a 3-year-old boy who was in full cardiac arrest. EC, the toddler who my dad later described as “dead-on-arrival” after being beaten to death by his father, effected not only my dad’s career but also the entire state. As a girl, I remember seeing a documentary disk on my dad’s desk with EC’s name. After inquiring about it, my protective father told me, “He was a very sick little boy that daddy took care of.” With time, and because of the public nature of his death, I learned the horrifying details. I’m confident my dad was always the energetic, hard-working, patient, avid note-taker, and gentle physician as so many described him. But EC challenged my dad. Decades after caring for EC and many others, my dad was diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer’s disease. He survived what was both a long and much too short ten years. And, while my dad was dissipating, becoming a mere shell of himself, I was becoming more and more like who he once was. My dad was no longer capable of caring for patients, his children, or even himself. As his disease progressed, I was growing up, learning to care for my terminally ill Daddy.
	The last five years of his life were also the most painful years of mine. For the last year of my dad’s life, I was the only person who was able to coax my father into the shower. At 15 years old, I didn’t want to be the one bathing my own dad after he defecated his adult diaper in the middle of a Starbucks. I was ashamed and I was angry. This type of occurrence dominated my childhood and often left me struggling to reconcile feelings of resentment with grief. The complex sentiments of my childhood shaped me into the observant and resilient individual I am today.
	Caring for my father and being surrounded by the other residents in his assisted living facilities instilled in me the value of compassion. Years later, as an EMT, I prioritized approaching all patients with a universal sense of compassion.
	January 2020: It was an old building and dimly lit. We were there to transport an immobile COPD patient with faulty communication skills, living in a one-bedroom apartment of a hoarder. We found the patient sedentary in a pile of feces with O2 tubing tangled in the mess. I explained we would take him to the hospital and get him more comfortable. He squeezed my gloved hand; that was his way of communicating. As we exited the elevator, the patient became distraught. He sat up and patted the top of his head while locking eyes with me. Being half Jewish, I knew what he needed. I returned with the patient's Yarmulke. His face lit up, and he squeezed my hand once more. I approached this patient with compassion, lacking judgment, mirroring the values my father once embodied when caring for EC. Despite these two patients being separated by more than 30 years, their similarities only brought me closer to my favorite person, despite our time together growing into a more distant memory. To myself and, more importantly, my patient, the significance of my actions extended far beyond a Yarmulke. It was about noticing someone's needs and acting in a manner that made them more comfortable and secure while dealing with so much unknown. My time spent with my dad in his assisted living facility was spent noticing so many things like this. I know how I would want a medical professional to treat my dad, someone who also struggled to verbally communicate at the end of his life, and I use this inkling to act with empathy in my own patient interactions.
	The healthcare system is rapidly evolving, yet it always seems like there’s never enough time. I’ve always hated the concept of time, often wishing I could either speed things up or stop the clock, depending on what was going on in my life. Before my dad got sick, I remember counting ‘sleeps’ at camp until my long-awaited return to the comfort of my parents’ arms. Or, in sixth grade, when my PE class crossed paths with my dad’s day program shuttle every day, I hoped the moments aligned just right so we could share a wave. And today, I sometimes wonder if this time was ever enough. Did I ever really know my dad? Or worse, will so much time pass that one day I’ll forget him? I find solace knowing that in more ways than one, I am him. Years apart, and not enough time together on this earth, but we are the same heart. Time is complex, but the bottom line is everyone deserves more time. More healthy time, more family time, more time to grow – and as a physician, I will try my best to give people more time, no matter the cost.","This past year I worked as a Research Assistant on Dr. Ringman‚Äôs team at USC. With a longitudinal clinical trial, we studied autosomal dominant dementia mutations. Since one of the mutations originates in Mexico, this gave me a platform to use my Spanish minor and connect with the Hispanic population. I noticed a language barrier between physicians and these patients and a lack of medical translators. This meant that many of our patients often waited until their health deteriorated before seeking care. No one should have limited access to necessary medical care, especially because of language and cultural barriers. I hope that my Spanish-speaking skills and experience working with Hispanic patient populations will help me be the empathetic and culturally-aware physician who assists in breaking down these communication barriers. Medicine must be inclusive, and cultural differences celebrated rather than hindering access to necessary medical care. ","During my work as an EMT, I had many patients in crisis, and I prioritized empathizing with them while maintaining quality care in the short time we spent together. One patient was a young girl with a femur fracture. As soon as I laid eyes on her, I knew she was in immense pain. While my partner requested more morphine before moving her, I approached the patient, noticing she tensed up with each inch I moved closer.¬†_x000D_

The TV was on in her room; I smiled and whispered something to her about the Disney Channel show in the background. When she started to relax, my partner signaled that we were ready to move her. I looked our patient in the eyes and said, ""Okay, now this part is going to hurt, but we can count to three, and just remember the sooner the pain starts, the sooner it's over."" And after the 45-minute ride, we had to do the whole thing again. I am confident that while our time together was brief, I made a difference in this young patient's experience. ",,,1,"I knew I could handle being a first responder with an autoimmune disease but doing the job during a pandemic brought obstacles that forced me to reflect on the bigger picture. The initial months of the pandemic brought a push-pull of emotions. I worked tirelessly to earn a position at UCLA EMS. Still, I wondered if it was worth the agony of voluntarily putting myself in situations where we did not even understand the full health implications. After meeting with several Field Training Officers, we decided that the position was not the right fit. This was when I decided that I needed to talk to someone. With the closure of one door came a chance to focus on me. I learned it was okay to feel scared as a young woman with an autoimmune disease during a pandemic, and at the same time, it did not negate my desire to be a physician. The opportunity to partake in therapy before attending medical school is something I know will enhance my ability to be a thoughtful and self-aware physician.",1,0,2

The customer’s bill had come to over $3,000 for one prescription—a single vial of insulin. Instinctively, I double checked the patient’s insurance information but to no avail, the charge was legitimate and had to be collected. I explained to the customer, a father of a young child with diabetes, that the cost was due to a commonly overlooked coverage gap in their insurance plan and waited for his response. As he processed what I had relayed, his eyes began to swell with tears and his head shook in denial. Expecting him to refuse the prescription I began to cancel the transaction, but before I could do so, he replied in a broken voice “Well I guess she has to have it…doesn’t she…”. With that, the father passed me his card and I proceeded to charge him the full amount. I will never forget the emotions expressed by the father that day or my own feelings of guilt during this transaction.
While working as a pharmacy technician for the last four years, I have repeatedly seen insurance and drug companies charge egregious amounts for prescriptions. Many times, I have witnessed the internal conflict that occurs as a patient decides if they can afford their medication or go without care until funds become available. Although such instances are sometimes unavoidable, they can be minimized by the efforts of a physician who is willing to advocate for their patients at every step.
My main motivation in becoming a physician is to serve as the voice for those who are unable to advocate for themselves. I have experienced firsthand what it is like to forgo care due to social repercussions, and I have witnessed others do the same to avoid financial ruin. It is my belief that in these situations a resolute physician is the most powerful advocate a patient can have—possessing the ability to transform the patient’s entire healthcare experience. 
By being involved and taking an interest in the patient’s financial wellbeing, I have seen many physicians negotiate with insurance companies to secure a cheaper alternative or lower price for medications that are vital to the patient’s health. While shadowing Dr. Jason Blomstedt, I saw him work tirelessly to ensure a complex prior authorization was completed appropriately and that the patient was notified when it had been approved, sparing them from worry. Conversely, I have also seen the alarmed look of patients when they are notified that their physician is not willing to investigate cheaper alternatives or other ways to minimize costs. These experiences have shown me just how potent the role of a physician can be as an advocate for their patients, but also how neglect for the patient’s financial status can negatively affect the care they receive. As a physician, I will seek to utilize these experiences to ensure that each patient receives affordable care and that third-party policies have minimal impact on the quality of care given.  
Advocacy is vital for those who do not meet the status quo of society and whose lifestyles differ from the norm, as my own health journey has illustrated. At several points in my life, I have been fearful to request necessary care, in fear of rejection or exposure from those who do not understand my concerns and lifestyle. While I have the knowledge and financial flexibility  to circumvent obstacles that may limit the care I have access to, I know that for many this is not a part of their reality. In these cases, in which the patient feels trapped and without options, a physician who understands their patients’ needs and struggles can have profound effects on the patient’s life. My life has been spared from chronic disease due to the acts of a physician willing to advocate for me when no one else would, and I am fervent to be this same beacon of hope and promise for my future patients. My journey has enlightened me to how inhospitable our healthcare system can be for those who go against the grain and how much effort, time, and money is needed to access the care an individual needs.  I am passionate about increasing representativeness and advocacy for marginalized groups in medicine, and I will forever act as an advocate for others who find themselves in a position where I once found myself.","While growing up, my parents housed individuals traveling for various reasons across the state. Most of these individuals, traveling for events related to our church, were foreign and often came from impoverished regions or third-world countries. While these individuals were in our home, my family was able to share many meals and conversations with them and often discussed how life differed back home from in the US. Through these conversations I was able to gain insight into how diverse humanity is in terms of values, culture and religion. Further, my own travels across the world have also contributed to my understanding of cultures different from my own and how certain beliefs or values come to be held. These experiences have provided me with a broad and open perspective to interact with others with and are something I am very thankful to have been exposed to.

This group provided for my community opportunities to engage with live music and to interact with others in the community. My hometown, McCook Nebraska, has long appreciated the arts but has had limited events open for the public to enjoy. Simply Strings has provided an outlet for the community to gather and allows the community to continue to value and appreciate the arts. As the group has progressed I have been able to see growing interest from the community, evident in our increasing audience size at our annual concert. With this group I have also been able to provide music for several area nursing homes and hospitals for patients. ",,,1,"The COVID 19 pandemic prepared me for medical school by directly showing me the role and critical need of healthcare professionals. During this time, there were several moments in which I was fearful of the future and was not sure what each day would bring. During these time I found comfort in the information and advice being shared by physician and other healthcare professionals. Further, while working in a hospital during this time I was able to see the direct role of physicians in leading the healthcare team in entire units infected with the virus. While these events were hard to watch at some points, it was inspiring to see the level of trust and unity among the care teams, each led by a physician. These experiences solidified my desire to become a physician and provided me with steadfast examples of what it means to be a leader, no matter the situation. The pandemic taught me a lot about myself and my capabilities, but especially showed me how important my own mental health is.",1,1,1

I inquired. ""Yes, I've had three miscarriages and am miscarrying now,"" she replied. I clenched my jaw, swallowing hard and fighting to keep my facial muscles still as I concealed the pang reverberating in my gut. Working for a private practice fertility clinic on Manhattan's Upper East Side, I was in an atypical consult when I coordinated and scribed a visit for Isabella, who was insured through Medicaid, currently unemployed, while miscarrying.  

Based on the patient's history, several standard genomic labs were indicated as necessary, with significant markers pointing to potentially underlying abnormalities in her chromosomal makeup. Unfortunately, no treatment plans currently offer can address these abnormalities, and as such, getting pregnant in these patients will lead to repeat miscarriages. Logically, this information should be considered necessary to one's well-being and health to prevent the trauma women endure with each miscarriage and to allow for coping with the reality that biological children cannot be an expectation within one's family building plan.

Despite the medical and anatomical evidence that this patient had aneuploid germ cells, Medicaid did not cover the required labs, deeming them unnecessary. As such, to minimize the out-of-pocket cost for the patient, Dr. Hade could only offer limited and generalized advice and little hope for clarity of her situation. Thus, leaving her both medically and emotionally unsupported. Understanding that even the limited care we could provide was far too expensive, I consulted with our practice founder to approve the waiving of her $650.00 New Patient fee. Despite this, waiving the fee would do little to impact the structural inequities that create the actual barriers to care here. The patient never returned nor answered my follow-up calls. I assume that she faces the same infertility predicament today as before she attended her appointment.  

Along with this incident and those I have been a part of, which are hauntingly similar, I have learned this is the dogma and limitation of our current medical systems. Through my Gender and Health minor, I took a course on Reproductive Justice. For my final paper, I researched how our current healthcare system creates disparities for women of color and lower socioeconomic status to impede childbearing autonomy. These women are disproportionately offered Long Acting Reproductive Contraceptives, such as IUDs or Nexplanon, even when their family-building process includes biological children. Additionally, these same populations are disproportionately limited in their access to options for unintentional or unwanted pregnancies. These factors severely limit these women's freedom over their lifestyle and family-building process. My desire to understand health disparities also led to my work in Dr. Kevin Chung’s lab, where I wrote about how people of minority racial, ethnic, rural, low income, and low socioeconomic status are greatly impacted in their ability to seek specialized medical services in plastic surgery and receive culturally competent patient education. Finally, this review demonstrated the need for more research on these disparities and an opportunity to create structures to mitigate these issues. As one who had, at a time, experienced severe financial hardships, notably in 2008 when my parents both were out of work and my father found himself reliant on methamphetamine in coping with these times, I have bared witness to the connections between lack of financial security and health. I have also faced my fair share of confusion or discrimination as a multiracial individual. Many times, I don't wholly belong to one category or another and have been the subject of disparaging comments targeting my Asian heritage. As someone who grew up in the diverse San Francisco Bay Area, I have witnessed and experienced the complex issues surrounding our country's social structures, but I am confident that I will be a culturally competent physician.

My journey to becoming a competent physician, cognizant of and willing to address disparities, has included many rewarding experiences. From my work at Birth Detroit, where we sought to address the disproportionate rates at which Detroit's Black mothers and infants face complications in the birthing process, to gaining hands-on research experience with pediatric patients facing Cystic Fibrosis, I've seen the many facets of medicine which can genuinely change the course of someone's life. As a physician, I hope that when I encounter patients like Isabella, I can do far more than waiving a fee; that knowledge from medical school and residency training, coupled with my exposure to the healthcare system, equip me to make a more significant impact.","In 2006, my mother quit her job as a mortgage broker. Then, my dad lost his job as the country plummeted into a recession. My parents borrowed money from my uncle to keep me and my brother in school. Matters worsened when my father turned to meth and alcohol as coping mechanisms. I remember that he and his friends were strung out on drugs constantly. One such friend developed schizophrenia and was in and out of the hospital. During this time, I witnessed many disturbing events unfold and found myself compartmentalizing. I wore different identities between my private grade school, gymnastics practice in Oakland, with my friends, and at home. I was hypervigiliant that my homelife didn‚Äôt necessarily always match that of my peers. I have experienced first-hand the effects of societal pressures on mental, physical, and intellectual health to the point of alienation from society. As a physician,  my experience will allow me to understand and empathize with my patients of various backgrounds.","As I became the Lead Study Coordinator at a dermatology clinic, I was surprised to find that even within research, there are still many obstacles to care. One of my studies only accepts patients with an official medical diagnosis of acne or rosacea. However many potential participants had severe, uncontrolled conditions, but were never seen by a provider and had no diagnosis due to a lack of insurance coverage. To dismantle this boundary, I developed a plan with our Practice Manager to provide these patients with a complimentary screening visit. Since then, I‚Äôve enrolled several participants who were previously untreated for their condition due to inability to afford care. In addition, I developed and executed a plan to deliver our clinic‚Äôs surplus soap, lotion, and face wash samples to a local women‚Äôs shelter. Although these actions are still minute, I hope to become a physician who consistently combats boundaries to wellness and healthcare and provides inclusive, quality healthcare.",,,1,"The pandemic hit as I embarked on my MCAT preparation, which felt saliently claustrophobic as an individual with ADHD.

2023,15233099,,23,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"Growing up in a family of Burmese refugees, I struggled to find a sense of identity and belonging. As one of the few Burmese in our neighborhood, my parents hid our culture, traditions, and language, in fear of being discriminated against or judged. Without cultural ties, I questioned my self-worth and longed for a community to call home. 

As the first in my family to enter college, I struggled to navigate my education, lacking resources and mentorship to guide my career. Living in a low-income household further worsened my challenges. At home, my family shared one car, which limited opportunities for work or volunteering. I also worked part-time to financially support my family and pay for food and rent.

Throughout my education and career, my experiences have taught me how to be resilient in times of vulnerability. From lacking cultural belonging to facing socioeconomic challenges, I learned how to navigate hardships and take initiative, actively seeking out opportunities for personal and professional mentorship as a Burmese-American. Most of all, I also discovered my passion to uplift disadvantaged communities like my own, mentoring low-income and first-generation students towards pathways in research and supporting health fairs and free vaccine clinics for immigrant and refugee populations.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,3907,1100.0,1547.0,390.0,,135.0,1,1937,1,1682,09/11/2020,University of California-Los Angeles,Psychobiology,0,,Yes,Yes,Yes,"$50,000 - 74,999",5,0,0,0,0.0,77.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,10.0,0.0,23,Exceptional,4,2023,4,1.0,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,"I was four when my grandfather’s fainting spells first started. The sights and sounds I distinctly remember: the dull thud of his head against the restaurant table, the flurry of ambulance sirens, the soft squeeze of my grandmother’s hands as we waited in the emergency room. For my family, who fled as Burmese refugees and hadn’t seen a primary care physician for decades, the ER was the easiest way for us to get the healthcare my grandfather desperately needed. What started off as one trip to the ER quickly spiraled into a multitude of health complications: kidney failure, liver cirrhosis, and colon cancer. As a young child, I struggled to understand why my grandfather’s health deteriorated so quickly, and I became disheartened with my inability to help. Witnessing the healthcare disparities of my family firsthand sparked my interest in medicine: a career where I can uplift vulnerable populations and create equitable access to care for underserved communities like my own.
I still thought of my grandfather while working as a Medical Assistant at an Outpatient Primary Care clinic. There, I encountered “Cherry,” who had refused getting mammograms for the past four years. When asked, she shook her head, expressing doubts about its purpose. Seeing her clenched fists and reservations brought me back to my grandfather, who relied on self-medication and resisted going to the hospital until it was too late. As a Taiwanese immigrant with limited English, Cherry felt overwhelmed with complicated terms discussed throughout her visits. She consistently struggled to receive and understand her medications, which further discouraged her from trusting her physicians. To ease her worries, I started to break down the mammogram process, using a combination of Chinese translations, analogies, and hand gestures to alleviate her fears. Witnessing Cherry’s gradual change and acceptance showed me the importance of holistic, preventative medicine. By utilizing cultural competency and inclusion as tools in understanding a patient, I can encourage them to engage in healthy behaviors and seek out routine preventative care. 
As a volunteer for Asian Pacific Health Corps, I continued to extend my experiences beyond an outpatient setting to local communities, coordinating free health fairs in churches and community centers. There, I administered free health screenings and became a translator to bridge communication gaps. “Nate,” who lacked reliable transportation, crossed the street alone in his wheelchair. “Am I able to see a doctor here?” This was a common question asked by many patients I met. “Sal,” who carried his two infant sons, shared his difficulties managing his diabetes due to lack of child care. “Ada'' who spoke limited English did not even know where to begin to enroll in health insurance. My interactions broadened my perspective about the barriers affecting preventative care and its direct adverse impact on the health of communities. Through learning about the diverse range of healthcare experiences and inequities in access, I discovered my passion for community health, further deepening my motivations to bring health interventions directly to communities and connect patients to care they need.
With the onset of COVID-19, I saw healthcare disparities in access magnify while working at Dynasty COVID Vaccine Clinic. As a volunteer helping to provide free vaccinations for immigrant, refugee, and uninsured populations, I saw an array of passports come my way, from Mexico and Brazil to China and Myanmar, each encased with their own experiences and stories. “Sarah,” a 10 year old girl, hid behind her guardian’s back as I examined her Burmese passport: an item I recognized from relatives who escaped from the military coup in Myanmar. Instantly, I thought of my parents’ own experiences–fleeing from daily gunfire and rationing moldy rice to survive, and struggling to rebuild a new life in a foreign country–and I related these hardships to Sarah in front of me, whose eyes remained fixed towards the floor. Extending my hand to Sarah, I sang a Burmese lullaby, one that my mother had often sung to ease my nervousness when I was younger. Her gaze meeting mine, I watched Sarah slowly emerge from her guardian’s shadow. Meeting patients who crossed national borders demonstrated to me how medicine can be mobilized to alleviate social inequities surrounding access to healthcare. As a future physician, I want to expand on and cultivate sanctuaries for displaced communities to receive care no matter where they come from, and bring justice to my grandfather’s memory. 
Medicine is the culmination of my passions for cultural humility, community health, and service. As I move forward in my journey, I am constantly reminded about my grandfather, my parents, and the patients I’ve met, who have shown me firsthand the challenges that immigrant and marginalized populations face when receiving care. Beginning with my childhood memories, my resolve for medicine has grown and deepened with each person and story I’ve encountered. From emergency rooms and primary care visits to mobile clinics and health fairs, I hope to create more accessible healthcare systems, empower patients with holistic preventative care, and in turn, foster community healing.","‚ÄúHenry‚Äù had untreated microtia and shuddered at the mere thought of being in a doctor‚Äôs office.

As a Financial Director for Speak Out for Surgery, a club raising awareness for domestic health inequities, I met other individuals like Henry, while working with low income Latinx and unhoused communities in Los Angeles.

However, exploring challenges of housing insecurity and navigating insurance being undocumented was new to me. _x000D_

With each patient interview, I was constantly humbled, learning about the institutional barriers of care that impact patient wellbeing. From demystifying insurance to finding accessible housing, I found ways to mitigate these barriers. I also recognized the power of community advocacy, using fundraising, caseworker referrals, and health literacy workshops to empower communities.","With the onset of the COVID-19, I witnessed how disparities in access to healthcare were exacerbated amongst vulnerable populations like my own. Burmese refugees have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country, low health literacy, and the lowest educational attainment rates among Asian subgroups -- disparities I see reflected among my own parents and relatives, who prioritized hard labor over school. However, as a Volunteer at Dynasty COVID Vaccine Clinic, I was able to alleviate language barriers to care by increasing health literacy and creating sanctuaries. Through translating vaccine information and patient intake for hundreds of patients, I helped to mitigate language barriers and distrust in uninsured and underserved populations.

This severe pain often caused me to miss classes and assignment deadlines. More than once, I left an exam knowing that I had failed due to not being able to finish it because the excruciating pain would cause me to black out for short intervals of time. I did not express what I was going through with my professors because I was embarrassed due to the nature of my medical condition, and I assumed that they would dismiss it as “bad cramps” and minimize the severity of it. This was a mistake. I should not have made assumptions about what they would think. I should have had an open and honest conversation with them about what I could have done to make up for the exams I was unable to finish.

I fought to keep my focus on the exam in front of me, but the stabbing pain in my lower abdomen was all-consuming. Suddenly, the exam was over, and I was turning in the exam which I had only half completed, knowing that I had failed. This was not the first nor the last time this would happen. The pain caused me to miss classes and assignment deadlines as well. I didn’t know what was happening to my body. Having been a disciplined and hard-working high school student, the feeling of failure was unfamiliar and distressing. I wanted to tell my professors why my grades had suddenly taken a turn for the worst, but I didn’t know how to. In my Mexican culture, “female issues” such as menstruation are rarely talked about, especially not with men. I felt embarrassed to tell my all-male electrical engineering professors that “bad cramps” were preventing me from excelling as I knew I could, and I was worried that I would not be taken seriously by my predominately male classmates if they found out. 
When I returned home at the end of the semester, I met the gynecologist who would change my life. After an initial assessment, he told me that I had endometriosis, which was later confirmed via laparoscopic surgery. I felt an overwhelming sense of relief to have an explanation for what was happening to me and to know that the pain I had endured during the previous semester had been valid. At the same time, I felt disappointed in knowing that my endometriosis had prevented me from reaching my full potential academically. My battle with endometriosis during the previous semester had led to my academic dismissal. I was devastated. This low point in my life opened my eyes to the importance of medicine and how much an illness can affect every aspect of your life. I was lucky to have found a gynecologist that patiently listened to me in a way that no one else had; however, I knew that many women were not as lucky. It felt unsettling to know that although endometriosis affects 10% of women, only a fraction of them are correctly diagnosed while the remainder continue to suffer. The fact that so many women have to deal with the repercussions of living untreated, such as disruption to their professional lives and the potential for infertility, ignited my desire to become a physician so that I can be an advocate for those in similar situations.
Starting over my academic career was a humbling and challenging experience. I knew that my grades from the previous semester would negatively affect my overall GPA no matter how well I did in the future, but I did not let that hold me back from pursuing my goal of becoming a physician. The daily medication I started taking after my surgery allowed me to have a normal, pain-free life again, which led to a transformation in my grades.
During my junior year, I began working as a scribe in the Houston Methodist Hospital Emergency Department (ED). As I became comfortable in the fast-paced environment, I found myself trying to absorb as much as I could from each patient encounter. Over time, I began to anticipate the questions the physicians asked during each evaluation and how the answers assisted in the medical decision making. Every encounter confirmed one thing for me: I wanted to be the one to gather all the information and come up with the best diagnosis and treatment for patients. I never could have imagined that my desire to become a physician was about to be tested by an unprecedented global pandemic. 
COVID-19 reached Houston in March 2020, causing fear and panic to spread amongst my fellow scribes in the ED. One-by-one half of them quit. I knew l was needed now more than ever as a massive influx of patients overwhelmed the nurses and physicians in the ED, so I decided to stay even though I knew I would have to take extraordinary safety measures to protect my family. When the hospital had to cut scribes due to costs, I was chosen to stay and was told it was because of my calm and level-headed nature, which was essential in such a dire situation. I worked day and night shifts, weekdays, and weekends, all while being a full-time student and maintaining my grades. When I would get home at the end of my shifts, sometimes at 4am, I would feel exhausted but with a sense of accomplishment and pride which motivated me through the nightmare that was the peak of the pandemic. The horrific events that I witnessed on the front lines changed me as a person. Although at times the situation felt emotionally unbearable, the heroism and bravery demonstrated by the techs, nurses, and physicians in the ED inspired me to keep going. I hope to one day become a physician as courageous and fearless as those that I met in the ED, running towards danger to care for patients who put their lives in my hands, trusting me to do everything in my power to help them during some of their most vulnerable and frightening times.","Growing up in Houston, which is considered one of the most diverse cities in the country, I have always been surrounded by people from all over the world. From elementary school, some of my closest friends have been from Vietnam, China, India, Mexico, and El Salvador to name a few. Learning in this environment was enriching as we all had to learn to be considerate with people from different backgrounds from a young age. I now recognize this experience as a very important aspect of my growth and development. As an adult, I not only welcome but seek opportunities to continue accumulating this type of exposure, and to contribute with my own perspective as a Hispanic woman. I feel fortunate to have grown up in such a diverse city that has that has given me the ability to be open and accepting towards people from different cultures and backgrounds.","The patient population at the emergency department (ED) I worked at in the Houston Medical Center consisted mostly of minorities. As a Spanish-speaker, I interpreted for many Hispanic patients in the ED when interpreters where unavailable during night shifts or, especially, during the COVID-19 pandemic. I witnessed first-hand how much of a difference it made for these patients to be able to communicate effectively with their physicians. They were always so grateful that all of their symptoms and concerns had been heard and taken into consideration in their treatment plan and that they understood what their next steps would be. Residents and consulting physicians would often ask me to interpret for them as well because they knew how important it was for them and their patients. Although interpreting was not officially part of my job as a medical scribe, it was one of its most rewarding aspects because I knew how much of a difference it was making for my local Hispanic community.",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic reached Houston, I was working at an emergency department (ED) as a medical scribe.

In addition, an internship with CDC Headquarters in Kenya I was selected for was cancelled. My job would have been to assist researchers focused on diseases such as tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS that directly affect the communities in this area. Lastly, the pandemic affected my ability to obtain volunteer experience with patients.

2023,15235593,,30,Man,USA,0,,1,1,"Growing up, my hometown was experiencing a lot of violence – I remember the walks to the nearby market, averting eye contact with gangsters on the way, and being afraid that I would be at the wrong place at the wrong time. My parents witnessed how the youth in our area were dropping out of school to join gangs and stressed the importance of education early on. While we lacked school resources at home, our family found ways to get around this obstacle and despite my city’s failing school system, I was fortunate to have teachers see my academic potential and push me to apply to private high schools in nearby affluent cities. With the help of my teachers and my family’s support, I received admissions with a full-ride to a prestigious high school.

She could tell Grandpa was suffering, but didn't know why or what could be done for him. I was in a position to help, thanks in large part to my parents' decision to relocate to the Bay Area. The two-car garage I called home gave me the better life they sought, but their immigration status has carried with it burdens, including sparse and fraught access to healthcare. Our struggles have profoundly impacted my desire to serve individuals in vulnerable situations. What this service would look like, however, wasn’t immediately clear to me.

In high school, my excitement for the academic opportunities that a scholarship presented quickly dissipated. I was one of a handful of minority students in an affluent setting. As I walked around campus on the first day of school, hair slicked back, wearing my favorite basketball jersey, I noticed how everyone looked at me. An upperclassmen spoke to me in a “cholo” accent, getting a couple chuckles from his friends. On another occasion, a classmate spit in my face and called me a “dirty Mexican.” Social survival became my top priority, and it stayed that way through several semesters of college.

That includes my sophomore year at UCSB, when I saw my best friend and roommate consumed by an opioid addiction. Suggesting he seek out therapy only drove a greater wedge between us. I felt helpless. During that time, I was in physical therapy and though I loathed the deep tissue therapy, which left my shoulder looking like it had skidded across asphalt, I saw how my relationship with my providers kept me on track and inspired confidence in a full recovery. These two contrasting experiences made me see what effective treatment looks like and how gruesome lack of care can be. For the first time, I began to consider a career in healthcare. 

As I learned more about medicine through my involvement in clinics and enrollment in post-bacc courses, I started to think about the impact I could have with families like mine. I’ve lived in fear for my family’s health. I understand what it’s like when your uninsured dad develops chest pain or your uninsured mom has painful untreated arthritis. I want to help patients like them. A sobering call from my mom last summer made me realize how critical this endeavor really is.

“Mijo, estoy preocupado por tu Abuelito.” Grandpa was not doing well. He had returned home earlier that week after an ER visit, but the language barrier had left my family confused. I took a look at the discharge paperwork. “The doctors found masses in Grandpa’s lungs, Mom.” I hugged her and my aunt. They told me he wasn’t eating, and I could tell he was fighting back considerable pain. “Let's get him to a hospital tonight,” I said. After rolling him through the double doors of the triage tent, I initiated emergency insurance paperwork, and after a long wait in the ED I heard his name called. I looked him in the eyes, told him that I loved him, and that he was in good hands. Given my clinical work experience and the language barrier, we all knew that navigating the healthcare system would fall to me.

“Your grandpa has metastatic colorectal cancer, and I’m afraid he’s approaching the end of his life,” is the sentence I had to translate for my parents. He was requiring more and more respiratory support, and his doctor needed a DNR decision. My family, clinging onto hope, insisted that we start him on chemo. I told them the doctor thought that further treatment would be futile, that CPR would only prolong his suffering, and it was unlikely he would wake up if intubated. As I did my best to help them understand his reality, I knew hundreds of thousands of families have likely faced similar medical decisions without the information needed to make an informed and compassionate choice.

Our family opted for palliative care. Pandemic policies prohibited visitors, but I explained to the charge nurse how he’d uniquely benefit from having family members around who could understand and comfort him. Fortunately, we were granted an exception. I called his doctor asking for a letter supporting an emergency visa for family members in Mexico and wrote letters to help facilitate their entry through U.S. Customs. 

Two weeks after Grandpa’s passing, I closed my eyes as I sat in the dark, quiet parking garage of the Pearson test center. I thought about his life, my family's sacrifices, and what I had overcome to get to this point. I recognized how my upbringing and difficulties growing up had equipped me to help bridge an enormous cultural divide in medicine. I felt privileged to have been in the position to help my family and am eager to help similar patients and their loved ones navigate their most difficult moments – not just by being a physician advocate for them, but also by  joining others in building pathways towards a career in medicine for the next generation of Latinx students.","I remember my first day at San Francisco Zen Center. While I was excited to help the chef, or ""Tenzo,"" prepare meals, I initially felt intimidated by the cultural differences I encountered. The way people moved about the center seemed to follow a specific set of rituals that I was not privy to. For example, instead of saying a simple ‚Äúhello,‚Äù monks and nuns I passed would come to a complete stop and take a deep bow in my direction. My initial intimidation quickly turned to respect, and I grew to love the sense of community fostered by these monks, nuns, and laypeople. From all parts of the world, they have come together with a common Buddhist aspiration ‚Äì to end the suffering of all sentient beings. I see medicine as an incredible opportunity to continue connecting with people from different backgrounds while contributing to this same aspiration by living a life of service where I treat and build nurturing relationships with patients.","The lack of educational opportunities and mentorship in my hometown contributed to a significant amount of my childhood classmates getting involved with gangs and dropping out of school. Throughout high school I heard stories of childhood friends who were in and out of the jail system and in 2012, I received the sad news that my former classmate, ‚ÄúAdrian,‚Äù had passed away at the hands of gang violence at the young age of 17. These experiences inspired me to establish a paid summer mentorship program at my research lab for first-generation college students who are underrepresented in medicine. Seeing my mentees‚Äô faces light up when concepts click ‚Äì like when I taught them immunofluorescent staining ‚Äì has been a highlight of my summer. As a future physician, I will continue to empower first-generation college students from underserved communities by implementing similar programs.",,,1,,1,1,1

I can distinctly recall the extent of my fear as my legs gave out from under me and I fell to the ground, the pain and blood shocking me into a state of vulnerability I had never experienced. My parents brought me inside and my mom cleaned the wound and started to stitch me up as I squeezed my dad's hand. Even more than the pain of the event, I remember and treasure the comfort of my dad's embrace in that moment. At first, I assumed this unique feeling could only transpire through a parent's relationship with their child. As I continued to mature and look to my parents for guidance, I realized that wasn't the case. I saw them leave for work every day and make a tangible difference in people's lives, just as they did for me in my moment of vulnerability. I admired how my parents, like other medical professionals, extended unwavering support and compassion to their patients each day, and this cultivated my own desire to be a part of that process as well. 
When I was 17, I had the privilege of shadowing a urologist and was able to sit in on operations like prostate surgery. One particularly senior patient struggled with the pain of the procedure, even with the anesthesia. While the surgery progressed, my eyes darted between the procedure monitor and the grimacing patient, feeling his uneasiness and pain. I approached with an outreached hand, which he squeezed firmly for the rest of the procedure. While I wished that I could do more in this situation, I felt as if I had started to fulfill a duty to do what was right for the patient. He later told me he wasn’t sure he’d be able to get through the procedure without my help. This experience started to solidify my conviction to become a physician. I was taken aback by how influential my seemingly minor actions could be on someone, and while I still wanted to do more, I learned that an integral part of healthcare comes from just being present and empathetic with the patient who may be suffering. As a physician, I would simultaneously showcase true, empathetic care, and motivate the healthcare team in our shared primary goal of doing what's best for the patient. While the elderly gentleman squeezed my hand in pain, I remembered squeezing my dad's hand as a child. I was reminded that across generations, backgrounds, and lifestyles, we all feel the same weight of pain and suffering at some point in our lives. That's why it felt so valuable to be there for him like my dad was for me. Despite not knowing each other, the bond in caring for this gentleman was incredibly fulfilling. 
As time went on, I was reminded both of this pain and bond when the roles were reversed and my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in August of 2020. As an impoverished immigrant from Mexico who had made a living in the Army and then as a PA, my dad had always blazed his own path, solving problem after problem and being my hero and role model throughout my life. So when our family was faced with a problem not even he could solve, it was hard not to constantly feel the immense weight of an impossible climb back up to a normal life. After three craniotomies and adjuvant chemotherapy, he could no longer use his entire left side as well as other higher faculties. My mom and I took it upon ourselves to be his primary caretakers and we witnessed him weaken with each passing day. I did my best to ease his suffering and stayed by his side, helping to feed him, move him, and use the restroom. Near the end, he couldn't speak and could only move his right arm. I sat by his side and he anxiously reached out for my own hand and squeezed with his remaining strength. I could see the sadness and relief in his teary eyes as we embraced. It was clear that just being there for him calmed his anxiety and comforted his pain. The months I spent with my dad, and even those few moments with the elderly man in surgery, left me hopeful to ease the burdens of more people in the future, especially when in a position where I can do more.
I sometimes felt hopeless, knowing that the end course of the disease was inevitable and that there was nothing I could do. However, I also cherished the 16 months I had left with my dad, and while he was originally given roughly 6 months to live, he willingly embraced aggressive treatment in the hopes of spending more time with loved ones. Looking back, I’m glad I could be at his side every day to comfort him during that terrible disease. 
Modern medicine gave my family that cherished extra time, and as a physician, I want to be able to help other families and sons like myself spend as much time with their loved ones as possible. The extra time we had affirmed for me that medicine is not always about curing diseases, but that just being there for someone alone is a powerful form of healing and empathy that makes the process of illness all the more manageable and human. As a physician, I hope to use my experiences to become a more well rounded provider, and show my future patients that I can be there for them in more ways than one.","My Army training in Kentucky brought together people from all over the country with varying backgrounds and living experiences and prompted us to come together as a team with a shared goal. During that time, I learned about each person's background, aspirations, and struggles. I remember one soldier from South Carolina. He told me about his struggles growing up in a small rural town, away from major education centers and hospitals, and with an expectation that most never receive a higher education. He used the Army to escape his home's impoverished and secluded lifestyle while hoping to one day support his family enough to relocate them someplace with more resources and opportunities. Being from Southern California, I did not fully understand this type of desperation before meeting him. I learned to recognize my privileged position and use my future career as a physician to advocate for patients like his family, who did not have the medical or educational resources to thrive._x000D_
","I recall one patient at the clinic, a homeless woman with diabetes. The physician and I spent much-needed extra time attending to her, and we formulated a practical plan for her to get the help she deserved. I also called and made her referral appointments while she was still at the clinic, then talked her through each one to help her better understand as she struggled to read and write. During our conversation, I learned of the intense struggles she went through on a daily basis, and she told me I had helped make it all just a bit easier. Seeing her more hopeful after our aid made me want to have a similar impact on others in her shoes. Patients like her showed me why it is crucial to develop a deeper understanding and connection with the diverse population served to best provide equitable care. In doing so, I could make a tangible improvement in their lives while preparing myself to meet my future patients' unique needs and challenges.",,,1,"When school shifted to online learning, I was thankful to be at home with my family during the difficult times of the pandemic and my dad's sickness. However, with everyone back at home, it would prove to be a challenge to maintain the same focus and study habits necessary to succeed. Nevertheless, by focusing on finding a balance between spending time with family, my schoolwork, and other responsibilities, I became more efficient with my time and more productive during my work sessions. The time management and coping skills I learned from navigating my dad's illness, my school work, and other responsibilities will carry over to medical school and prepare me to succeed no matter the challenge that life throws my way.",1,0,3

I started with an interest in business and took a summer internship working at a lending institution in Chicago during the Summer of 2016. Although I learned a lot from this experience, I truly felt like something was missing. The time spent pouring through figures and tables was intriguing, but not fulfilling. I aspired for deeper connections with real people, to help others navigate complex problems, and to use my problem-solving skills in a scientific context. As I advanced through high school and college, I found that my exact interests pointed me to medicine. I realized that I could best accomplish my goals by pursuing a career as a physician because of the plethora of opportunities for creativity and discovery through conducting research, the ability to specialize, and the chance to lead a team of clinicians. Since coming to this realization, I have made a conscious effort to expose myself to experiences that would best prepare me for life as a physician. 

One meaningful experience was my time volunteering in a local emergency department, where I learned that practicing medicine is more than simply prescribing treatment: it involves a combination of proper body language, providing empathy, and overcoming language and health literacy barriers. These components of the doctor-patient relationship are fundamental to building trust and maximizing the quality of care provided by the healthcare team. The specialists I observed in orthopedics, anesthesiology, internal medicine, primary care, and radiology were masters of these principles. Whether dealing with challenging workplace complexities or treating patients suffering from excruciating pain, these physicians truly listened to their patients and understood the value of the role they carried in their care. The empathy, composure, and pursuit of health equity that these physicians exhibited in the clinic are attributes I strive to embody in my practice. As a doctor, I want to use active listening as a powerful healing tool, serve others with equanimity, and understand the perspectives and stories of my patients when formulating treatment plans. 

Serving my community at the Phoenix Allies for Community Health (PACH) Clinic allowed me to shift observation into action as I volunteered with physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and physician assistants in their respective practices. I serve as the PACH COVID-19 Vaccine Center Co-Coordinator, which allows our team to order vaccines, assemble a group of volunteers, log data, and schedule patients every weekend. PACH serves the marginalized Latinx community of Phoenix and reduces barriers to equitable healthcare access. Coordinating these vaccine events with other volunteers gave me the opportunity to expand access to care and improve the public health of my community. Experiences such as volunteering at PACH, the local food bank, mentoring at-risk youth through after-school programs, or assisting the elderly in preparing their homes for the winter allowed me to feel the personal fulfillment that comes with helping those in need and witness the profound impact that my actions could have on the well-being of my community. I hope to continue working with underserved communities, both internationally and domestically, throughout my career to work towards mitigating disparities along socioeconomic, racial, gender, and ethnic lines. As a physician, I want to continue my work with Latinx populations by providing care in both English and Spanish to improve access to care and healthcare comprehension amongst my patients in this community. 

Over the past year, I have been working as a medical assistant and a clinical researcher in a Mohs micrographic surgery and dermatologic oncology practice. This opportunity afforded me significant patient interactions and a chance to gain a broader knowledge of the responsibilities of a physician. It has also led to several peer-reviewed journal publications and an abstract since I began in May 2021. I collaborated on research projects, assisted in surgeries, and took patient histories. My work as a medical assistant has allowed me to serve a diverse patient base by assisting in surgical procedures such as Mohs micrographic and complex reconstructive surgery. My clinical and research activities introduced me to another avenue to help patients on a broader scale and understand disease processes as a physician, motivating me to continue involvement in academia throughout my career. During my career as a physician, I want to continue using my curiosity and application of the scientific method to further discover different pathologies, therapies, and medications to better treat patients. 

The ability to serve others and conduct research have invigorated me to serve a positive role in my community and the world as a medical student and a physician. My initial exploration of other fields, such as my summer in business, sparked my journey to medicine, but my continued experiences in various clinical, research, and volunteer contexts are what truly deepened my desire and sparked my drive to pursue a career in medicine, better informing me of the rewards and challenges of life as a physician.","Spending time in Iran and with my family has allowed me to see how my upbringing differs from that in the United States. The stories of my family informed me of their experiences during the Islamic Revolution. I deeply value freedom because of my parents' struggles as their liberties were taken away during the revolution. One trip to Iran was during nationwide demonstrations, the Iranian Green Movement, advocating against an election that many believed had been manipulated by the government. During my weeks there, I saw a regime violently suppress peaceful protestors and bystanders, which showed me not to take my freedom for granted. This was the first time I saw regulation on freedoms I have been so used to my entire life, as I grew up as a first-generation Iranian American. As a student at Rush Medical College, I believe my experiences throughout life will allow me to continue learning from my peers and serve a diverse community fairly.","As a volunteer at PACH, I work as a Spanish interpreter to provide COVID-19 vaccines, interpret primary care visits, and record patient histories and vitals. As a physician, I plan to communicate with non-English speakers, and this past year has bolstered my familiarity and understanding of medical Spanish in a clinical setting. Working directly with the Spanish-speaking community in Phoenix as an interpreter and COVID-19 vaccine coordinator at a free clinic impressed upon me the value of working with diverse populations. Directly serving marginalized communities to improve healthcare delivery by reducing language and technological barriers motivates me to continue serving my community as a physician while practicing medicine in Spanish and English. This past year has not only reaffirmed that I understand the life of a physician and am eager to pursue this career, but it has better prepared me to succeed in medical school and make a profound impact on my community as a physician. ",,,1,"During my gap year, I planned to apply to medical school while working as a clinical researcher in Chicago. The opportunity was canceled due to the pandemic. Looking for other opportunities to pursue instead, I found a different clinical position that also allowed me to work with patients as a medical assistant. I completed projects and worked with a team to publish manuscripts about reconstructive surgery in dermatology, conserving lidocaine in a global shortage, ways to prevent sharps injuries, and unique methods to shape cartilage grafts. The pandemic also highlighted the need for medical care for marginalized communities, such as the Spanish-speaking populations in central Phoenix, which I served as a volunteer. I recognize that the pandemic has a lasting impact, and I am fortunate not to have faced hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The past year enhanced my clinical knowledge and reinforced my desire to pursue medicine, fight for health equity, and serve others.",1,0,2

What was supposed to be a forgettable follow-up visit for back pain had taken an unexpected turn right in front of me. Continuing with the check-in process, I verified the rest of Mrs. K’s information. I took her blood pressure as I told my usual joke about imagining a relaxing beach with a margarita in hand - no salt, of course. She let out a lighthearted laugh, but the unbridled fear and vulnerability that we shared in that moment continued to weigh us down. Even though she would be crushed by the eventual revelation of metastatic cancer, the magnitude of her trust in me left a profound and unforgettable impression on my heart.

Working as a medical assistant at a family care center has always brought unique emotional and intellectual challenges. My persistent curiosity and pursuit of knowledge had driven me to achieve a master’s degree in kinesiology. However, despite the confidence I mustered up on the complexity of human physiology, every patient brought with them their own unforeseen obstacles. Wincing, I assisted Mrs. P. in slowly removing the bandages she had fixed under her arms and breasts. Attempting to hide the painful, draining lesions, my heart broke as she shared the embarrassment she felt with something as simple as wearing summer clothing, or as personal as intimacy with her partner. With a new diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa, she found herself overwhelmed by the cost of treatment and the number of follow up visits that would ensue. Struggling to secure transportation, I connected her with our Uber Health program, but still wished I had more to offer. Whether it was fighting limited access to care, or straining to afford medications, I was coming to the realization of just how complicated healthcare can be.

Instead of straying away from these multifaceted disparities, I became motivated to find alternative ways to create connections through my role as chronic care navigator. I still remember the excitement in Mr. S’s voice when he told me his blood pressure readings were finally within target range. For four weeks we had implemented a routine that fit with his taxing schedule. Between weekly phone calls and visits with our dietitian, he established a new normal. We shared a laugh when he joked that this was the first time he wasn’t nervous for his upcoming three month follow-up visit. Unfortunately, not every interaction has been this fruitful. Ms. B proves to be one of my most challenging patients. After the unexpected death of her sister in February, she has struggled to make ends meet while caring for her own three children and now her two nieces. As our relationship has grown, my initial bias shifted from viewing her as non-compliant and difficult, to persevering and tough loving. Devastated to see her health placed on the back burner, I have worked hard to learn how to effectively communicate with her. While our goals are not yet met, I continue to meet her where she is at and push forward little by little.

My passion for working with under-resourced communities has been incredibly rewarding, but the limitations of my role as a medical assistant and care navigator have become more frustrating. While I cherish the relationships I am able to form and continue to enjoy growing alongside each patient, I struggle with the desire to navigate other aspects of their care. I aspire to be an effective liaison for the patient, where I can help coordinate between other disciplines, balance their prescriptions, and utilize my knowledge to design the most effective strategy for treatment. More than being a provider for this community, I want to be an advocate and leader. Longing to create a space where someone feels secure enough to confide in me their deepest concerns or share the extenuating factors that pose a barrier between them and their health; I will strive and continue to forge relationships built on trust. Because I try to see the entire picture for each patient, I also long to be a part of their parents’, daughters’, brothers’, and grandchildren's lives. In order to be this medical foundation for each patient, I find myself called to become their physician.","Centered in one of Kansas City‚Äôs most impoverished regions, HFCC has a patient population composed of people who are different from me economically, culturally, racially, and educationally.

Mrs. C presented for a follow-up regarding hypertension. What started out as a simple conversation about salt intake turned into an exchange of recipes. When telling her about the home-grown tomatoes I use for salsa, her face lit up, and she started gushing about her own impressive garden. Living just two blocks away for the last 72 years, she has gradually expanded this garden. Vulnerably sharing her financial hardships, I learned that Mrs C grows enough food to sustain her through the winter. In this moment I was humbly reminded that what is a hobby to me, comes out of necessity for her.","When invited to step into the role of Chronic Care Manager (CCM) at HFCC, I was elated at the opportunity to commit more time to this patient population and improve access to care.

While assessing our clinic‚Äôs preventative measures, I discovered mammography compliance was 3%, and 85% of mammogram orders were incomplete. Upon reaching out to patients, it became evident that cost and education were significant factors. In an effort to mitigate cost, I connected with imaging centers who provide reduced out of pocket pricing and sliding scale fees. Collaborating with providers, I developed handouts educating patients on mammography technique, importance of preventative screenings, and risk factors. I‚Äôve learned that in order to impact a community, you must intentionally communicate to better understand why needs exist.",,,1,"Ironically, I am writing this as I recover from variant BA.5. Like many, the COVID-19 pandemic altered the timeline I planned for my application to medical school. Working in healthcare throughout the pandemic posed the greatest challenge to this timeline. Struggling with staffing shortages resulted in extended working hours and limited time off. Because of this, test dates were pushed back, less time was available for shadowing, and hours allotted to working on my application were restricted. _x000D_

In the past, she had sometimes forgotten important events or saw things that were not there, but this time she was so frightened and convinced that it was clear something was wrong. After seeing her doctor, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Blindsided, I scoured the internet. I wanted to understand why it had happened to my grandma and what I could do to help her. Reading that keeping the mind active slowed the disease’s progression, I brought her a math workbook to keep her stimulated. Over time, she started to forget how to cook foods I had grown up eating or wash her clothes, and I began to watch and care for her after school. One day, she forgot my name, and I realized that despite my best efforts and modern medicine, her disease would continue to progress. When she forgot her words, I still listened attentively; when she forgot how to chew, I brought her meal replacement shakes. At the end of her life, she passed peacefully in the morning after a restful night of sleep. Her battle, lasting 8 years, made me understand that there was nothing more valuable to me than trying to alleviate her suffering. She showed me that I could make a true difference in someone’s life. I will never forget the fulfillment I received from caring for her and her story has inspired me to pursue medicine to help others through that same compassionate care.
 
Between caring for my grandmother and transitioning to college, I found teaching piano to be an outlet to share my passions with others. When I started teaching Elsie, she struggled with the treble clef. Despite being an otherwise quick learner, this made her struggle to learn new songs despite reviewing the topic each lesson. Brainstorming ways to better adapt my teaching, I tried many different strategies such as rote memorization and individually labeling the keys and sheet music. Finally, I created a mnemonic called “FACE in SPACE” for her to remember that the notes F, A, C, and E are in the SPACES of the treble clef. She was finally able to overcome the block and make progress towards new pieces. Finding an approach that worked for her allowed me to help her overcome difficulties with other topics as she advanced. By working with her, I have learned to become a more flexible teacher, realizing that all students learn differently. As a scribe, I have seen that teaching is central to medicine. One physician, for example, spent an hour teaching a new patient about her nonischemic cardiomyopathy. She later expressed that she learned new things about her condition that she never knew before despite being diagnosed ten years prior. In medicine, I seek to utilize the skills I have gained as a piano teacher to personalize my care of each patient, taking into consideration their unique backgrounds, and teach patients about the pathology of their diseases and treatment options.

Scribing has also afforded me the opportunity to meet patients such as Trey, a 50-year old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Previously an avid runner, he became unable to walk up a flight of stairs without becoming short of breath. Our team recommended he undergo catheter ablation, and, at his follow-up, he expressed his relief and gratitude that he was now able to return to doing what he loved—running. I saw myself in Trey. When I was 18, I injured my lower back and suddenly could no longer do what I loved – tricking. Though it took months of rehabilitation, I eventually recovered and learned firsthand how freeing it feels to heal from illness. Knowing that I had contributed to his care felt meaningful. Beyond that, I found it fascinating how our understanding of the physiology of the human body and pathophysiology of disease could be used to develop a treatment. I thought about how disorganized signals originating from the pulmonary veins caused his atrial fibrillation. By understanding this mechanism, our team could use cryo energy to freeze Trey’s pulmonary veins, form a durable scar, and thus block these disorganized signals from conducting. Counterintuitively, otherwise healthy heart tissue had to be destroyed to cure the disease. As a scribe, the gratification I have received from seeing how medicine has significantly improved the lives of my patients coupled with my interest in the underlying mechanisms of the human body and disease have further pushed me towards becoming a physician.

In caring for my grandma, I gained an appreciation for the difficulty—yet importance—of compassionately caring for others. In teaching, I have enjoyed working closely with my students and tailoring my lessons to each student. These activities led me to explore opportunities in healthcare such as scribing, and in medicine, I see a field that combines my desire to improve the lives of others and passion for education with my interest in scientific technologies and advancement. Though limited in what I could do to help my grandma, I seek to become a physician to care for others like I did for her and to improve medical knowledge and treatments to help patients live longer and better lives.","I met Rosie, an older Hispanic woman, at the Ballard Food Bank. According to her, I was the first volunteer to ask for and remember her name. After helping her weekly, she opened up to me about some of the struggles she faced as a homeless woman. Eventually, she revealed to me that she had been assaulted twice in three months. She then opened her bag, revealing to me a Taser that she carried to defend herself. Describing how she constantly worried for her safety, I learned more about some of the struggles of what living homeless in Seattle is like and to be more cognizant of the struggles those from different backgrounds may face. I felt proud to have successfully developed our relationship such that she not only trusted me to help her with her meals, but also felt comfortable enough to share her vulnerabilities with me.","I first started teaching piano to Jason, a shy student with no prior musical experience, in 2017. As we progressed through the curriculum, he began to realize how much effort was needed to succeed in piano. He began to practice more at home, and I noticed how this paid off in the increasing speed that he was completing assignments. I encouraged him to continue his hard work. At his first recital, he was extremely scared of performing. Following this, I helped him gain confidence through mock performances._x000D_

As I reflect, I still remember how he was playing ‚ÄúOld MacDonald‚Äù in 2017. Now, he performed Mozart at his recent recital with poise and confidence. I am amazed to see how far he has come as a pianist and how he has grown into an outgoing, confident young man.

As a result, my parents, relatives, and I spent more time personally taking care of my grandparents. Not only was this emotionally stressful, but it required a significant time commitment.  I spent the most time taking care of my grandparents in the summer after I graduated in 2020. After I became employed in August 2020, I still went home every weekend to help my parents care for my grandparents which continued until my grandparents passed away in November 2021 and March 2022.

Tammy, whose name I learned shortly after, was not my first patient. However, she was the first to have been so close to death. This interaction is one of many where I have borne witness to the grim realities of the medical field and yet it does not take away from the incredible interactions that keep me pursuing a field I love. 

Just before graduating high school, I was devastated to hear the news of my grandfather’s cancer diagnosis. For the next few months, I watched him undergo treatments at the hospital. I felt powerless in that there was nothing I could do except to be there for him. His diagnosis left me with a yearning to learn more about the pathophysiology of his condition and so I decided to pursue biology. In my classes, I learned about the body’s internal defenses against cancer, however, sometimes this is not enough to stop cancer. A few years later, I was fortunate to be selected to participate in the Summer Research Opportunity Program through the University of Michigan. My focus was to research how therapeutic drugs were designed to aid in the treatment of cancer. I spent hours immersed in articles on the development of therapeutic drugs. It gave me the opportunity to use my knowledge from the classroom and apply it to solve real-world problems. Research allowed me to further my pursuit of knowledge to help people, such as my grandfather.

As the daughter of an immigrant, I would often find myself having to translate for my mother growing up. She would bring me along with her to doctor appointments, where I would try my best to explain her symptoms to her physician. He would listen to me as I did my best to explain everything, and I admired him for his patience and understanding. As I got older, I realized that language barriers prevent people from seeking much-needed medical care. I had witnessed this too many times and wanted to make a change, even if it was on a smaller scale in the grand scheme of things. 

These interactions inspired me to become an English as a Second Language tutor for Washtenaw Literacy during my undergraduate studies. I met once a week with a group of adult learners of different backgrounds. As a tutor, I was responsible for cultivating lesson plans tailored to their learning styles. Zhivko from Bulgaria talked about his excitement to retire from his factory job so he could spend more time with his grandchildren. Dario from Mexico talked about his dreams of working in hotel management. I enjoyed seeing their progress throughout the weeks and learning about their successes. Their stories of perseverance inspired me to continue my own path in medicine. 

My experiences both inside and outside my clinical experience have helped cement my passion for medicine. I want to be a source of trust for my patients, regardless of cultural and language barriers. I want to be there for them in times of celebration and in times of distress, holding their hands through it. This is why I want to be a physician, to make an impact in my community. The satisfaction of helping to alleviate someone’s pain or something as simple as putting a smile on their face makes the journey worthwhile.","Growing up in an immigrant family, I would get weird looks from my peers during lunch when I would bring traditional foods from home. I began to fear roll call, as I would hear my name mispronounced countless times. I felt like an outsider, surrounded by people who were different from me in various ways. My junior year of college, I discovered Washtenaw Literacy and decided to become an English as a second language tutor for them._x000D_

As an ESL tutor, I had the opportunity to interact with people of various cultures and backgrounds. Growing up in a town with little diversity, I welcomed this change as it allowed me to meet people I would not have met otherwise. My learners shared with me about their cultures and traditions, something which I greatly valued. I have learned to appreciate these differences that us unique. My experiences as an ESL tutor have fostered my enthusiasm to learn about other cultures and perspectives, which is something I look forward to in medicine.","When I worked in urgent care, I often encountered many challenging situations which did not have simple solutions. One day as I registered a new patient, she explained that she did not have medical insurance. I informed her about the option to be seen as a cash patient, meaning she would have to pay out of pocket for her visit. At this urgent care, cash patients were required to pay the office visit the same day as their visit, which often presented a problem for many people. She let me know her situation and that she could not afford the office visit due to financial issues. I did not want to turn her away as I knew people were experiencing financial problems during the pandemic. I met with my manager and explained the patient‚Äôs situation to him. He acknowledged my concerns and we decided to bill the patient for her visit. She was very appreciative of our understanding. I hope to have impacted someone‚Äôs ability to access medical care that day, no matter how simple it may have been.",,,1,"I had been working as a medical assistant for a year before the pandemic started. Much fear and misinformation was going around, and I questioned whether I wanted to continue pursuing medicine during a scary time. However, I decided against leaving and continued working, where I would test dozens of patients a day for COVID-19. I heard the fear in their voices when I would call for positive test results, faced with the uncertainty of their diagnosis. _x000D_
My experience was a little different working as a patient care technician in one of the COVID units in the hospital. It was difficult having to witness many patients get worse as time went on. Seeing the improvement in other patients‚Äô conditions often renewed my hope and reminded me of why I wanted to become a physician. Being in these positions as a healthcare worker during a pandemic reaffirmed my decision to continue my path to medical school.",1,0,1

My mother grew up during the Civil War while my father’s village has no clean drinking water to this day. The family separated to establish a better life for the children. Since the economic toll of education was better buffered in the US, as opposed to the UK, through the provision of financial aid, a decision was made for me to move schools. In this way, I was fortunate enough to afford continuing education at a top tier college - something I once thought impossible. 
Sponsorship for Scholarship: I have been the recipient of need-based assistance in the form of grants and bursaries that funded my secondary and tertiary education. My family income bracket always fell below household thresholds for FAFSA, which found me eligible for null contribution. I also chipped in via work-study stipends as a means to pay rent. Still, there was familial responsibility to be as fiscally independent as possible. After late payments for dormitory and tuition costs led to disenrollment from classes and, on one occasion, being locked out of my room, I had to petition for further funds.

Arms. Speech. Time. These were the signs of stroke, according to an advert on the telly. Days later, when slurs laced Nana's voice, a young version of me became versed in the cursory mnemonic. With a British stoicism that kept her calm, I put into words what unfolded until an ambulance arrived. While the NHS nursed her regardless of citizenship, my visits consisted of helping in the only way I could: daily doses of laughter. Across the pond, we call it the gift of the gab. Equipped with a bit of banter and flexible repertoire, I tend toward comic relief. Always the protector, concerned with making people feel better, I wanted to be a provider. I would bend over backwards-literally. Mumbling, Nana swore she would be dead had this happened back home. While she did later suffer a stroke in Nigeria, she survived, albeit crippled. I questioned why the outcome was so different. Revelations about epidemiology triggered outrage, then intrigue, in public health. Lack of access to even PSAs leave our natives helpless. My therapeutic curiosity stems from that early perception of health disparity, as its determinants were made devastatingly clear by Nana. Having harnessed my sensitivity to subtleties, such as context clues and body language, to detect time-sensitive symptoms, applied science resonated with me. I wondered how linkage between social and natural science could respond to need. Justice has always been important to me, but its rendition in health is inspirational. So far as biology justified such signals, scientific study gave my nosy mind direction. This led me to the US. I sought to get to the bottom of socioeconomic or environmental telltales to health. Travel introduced overwhelming insularity and insecurity, which were emotions foreign to me. I couldn’t talk my way out of this one. It took time and treatment to mend maladaptive practices. Where was the girl with the gab? That being said, recovery began with reflection. Once I established an equilibrium between being thoughtful and overthinking, introspection was a source of empowerment. In this way, stigma doubled as my strong suit. Mindfulness, perhaps the most underrated social skill, will let me look behind surface markers. Meanwhile, the dismissal of mental health concerns by my tough-love family, who could not legitimize any illness that was not visible, left me to fend for myself. At odds with medical mistrust and supernatural beliefs, psychiatric acceptance is hard to come by in black communities. For many, lack of awareness worsens taboo, which only adds insult to injury. Instead, I see it as a silent epidemic that I must not only manage but leverage in order to validate others. I’m even better suited to attend those in need—not as a distant observer, but as a sapient empath. While 9 out of 10 doctors in Nigeria seek to leave, I am compelled to do the opposite. There, my perspective can humor my passion for patient service. Health equity means all measures of well-being, including mental. Coping taught me that there is no catch-all cure to sickness, or the experience of it. Like comorbidity, I treat intersectionality holistically. I grew interested in how psychology and physiology converge along pathology. Soon enough, resolution gave way to research that employed these very lessons. Work with HIV-positive participants in research that synapsed the specialties of psych-neuro-immunology, whose societal stigma exposed more vulnerability, delays in treatment-seeking and exclusion from interventions, evidenced the need for interdisciplinary study and aired a universal need for affirmation. In aims to better the participant experience, I noted that, sometimes, TLC is the best medicine. Later, I used affective sensibility to curate my approach within another vulnerable population, children, who use expression as outlet. Taking this to heart, I have known an emotional bond to be as vital as a clinical one. Life's lessons were not only formative to my emotional maturity, allowing me to keep my wits about, but also inform the scope and nature of my care practices. It's transformative to my contributions as a classmate, conversationalist and countryman. It was a process, not a position. Throughout the turbulence, I tapped into a socio-scientific sixth sense. As an outlier longing to belong, I found my place and purpose in the pursuit of medicine. From medical advocacy to translational policy, I am conscientious. Like advocates, doctors know their job is done when they no longer need you. I know I can bridge borders, bring perspective and breed compassion (pregnant pause) because I’ve done so before. Beyond the call of duty, I can be support system for minority and marginalized groups. I can use cultural comparison to convey and demystify disease. With the competency to enlighten and an expectancy of endless insight, I can continue to serve as relief for social ills, providing tactful care for the sickly, stigmatized and susceptible. It's often said that jokes are all about delivery; interaction with an audience mirrors communication with patients, and comic timing resembles the ability to counsel while avoiding unease. Having explored new material, I set the stage for medicine. Since, I’ve refined my bedside manner, whether humor or healing.","I set out to fully immerse myself in the American experience through Greek affiliation. Though I thought a group couldn't be more white than my high school in rural Maine, I was wrong. On bid day, I was surprised to see that none of my so-called sisters looked like me, and feared that I would be the token black girl. Even so, I gave it a chance conducive to expose any bias, or at least lead by example. Learning from diversity requires fight not flight. Until we hold ourselves and our organization accountable, there isn't collective effort, let alone change. With this in mind, I opened the floor to peer dialogue about racial slights or fiscal stress. The more I listened, I found we were more similar than I initially gave credit for. In furtherance of intercultural fraternization, such interpersonal narratives complement care. These fireside chats became known as Courageous Conversations, which let us emerge as a dynamic, inclusive and representative class. Above all, I am a team player.","Blood is thicker than water. I learnt this the hard way: in the thick of a dark and deficient delivery room in Nigeria. A fatal postpartum hemorrhage opened my eyes to our maternal-neonatal mortality rate, where the preventable loss felt cruel. Having already labored by the light of my phone, the new mother bled from childbirth. Her husband was told there was no blood and, perhaps worse, no blood bank. The need for blood is universal, but access is not. It offended me as a black woman, immigrant and fellow human-being. Then and there, I embarked on a medical mission-change from within. Demographic disservice moved me to service-learning in New Orleans. Besides transfusions, I'm a clinical resource for cultural competency, racial relativism and mental-health advocacy. Through inter-professional rigor and interpersonal ties, teamwork treats overlooked communal needs or complications. In the same vein, I coordinate efforts overseas, using what I learn for effective, enduring service work.",,,1,"Lockdown deglobalizes us. Social distancing goes against human nature. No matter which population, the pandemic was telling of this. Due to underlying fear in the HIV/AIDS cohorts, prone to infection, and minimal personnel on-site, work-study hours were cut. In the midst of my research, it changed entirely. To negotiate seemingly dire times, clinical conduct had to be modeled appropriately. Countermeasures consisted of consolidating contacts. I took it upon myself to review safety bylaws, update voluntary consent and envision a new variant of mediation- online. Expecting virtual visits to threaten participation, I emphasized outreach. This couldn't have been farther from the truth. For want of company, otherwise healthy subjects made time for ample, in-person checkups. Others navigated long-term treatment adherence, which I assessed via video. Despite publication plans fading into a prolonged timeline, my hands-on, frontline input on outpatient therapy proved worthwhile beyond measure.",1,0,2

As I slowly realized what had happened, I felt a stabbing sensation along my inner right thigh. I had torn my adductor longus and ended my hockey career. I was overwhelmed by a feeling of helplessness following the injury, but the medical staff who cared for me during my recovery helped relight the fire inside me. In particular, Sharon, my physical therapist, went above and beyond. She helped me set goals and encouraged me on days I felt like giving up. I would not have made it through my recovery without her. Looking back on the experience, I hope to provide the same determination and compassion to people when they are dealing with medical challenges that can be life-changing. Whether it is people struggling to afford access to healthcare due to financial barriers or patients like myself trying to get back to things they love, I have realized, through clinical exploration, that I can best address both as a physician.

While recovering from my injury, I made lifelong friends who helped comfort and support me. Through these relationships, I had my eyes opened to some of the glaring disparities that exist within healthcare. As I learned more about biomedical engineering during college, I was determined to be involved in increasing access to medical technology. During my senior year, I led a team of my peers in developing a less-expensive alternative to an upright walker for “Mary,” a 93-year-old woman, who could not afford the current device. We decided to design an attachment to current rollator walkers that could transform them safely and inexpensively into an upright walker. When it came time to hand off the device to “Mary,” she lit up with joy as tears started to roll down her face. In that moment, I realized how deep of an impact creating accessible medical technology can have on people who cannot afford the alternative. As a physician, I would want to continue to use the skills I developed during my engineering degree to innovate within healthcare, and help patients like “Mary,” with the goal of addressing disparities within the field.

While writing the provisional patent for our walker, I realized that increasing access to medical technology is only one piece of the puzzle. This became glaringly clear as I watched COVID-19 disproportionately affect marginalized populations. I decided to start the non-profit Your Health Matters, Inc. to help lessen financial barriers to healthcare. Alongside my board of directors, we have directly supported local free clinics in the Boston area through fundraising and by recruiting a team of physicians to provide free virtual consults for patients who cannot make it to a clinic. As a future physician, I want to continue to work with these marginalized communities and help remove the financial burden of seeking healthcare.

Following college, I worked for H-Wave, a medical device company that makes an electrostimulation device aimed at eliminating pain. While at H-Wave, I had the opportunity to work with “Bob,” a patient like myself, who wanted to get back to activities he loved. He suffered from chronic back pain and could no longer play with his three children because the pain had become so debilitating. While fitting him for the device, he confided in me some of the goals he had if the pain subsided. He pulled a picture of his kids out of his wallet and said while on the verge of tears, “If this device helps my pain, I promised him,” pointing at his youngest son, “that I would help him learn how to play baseball.” A wave of overwhelming emotion crashed over me before I smiled and replied, “Let’s try every placement we can to make that a reality.” After an hour or so of working with his physician to find the right placement for the electrodes, we were able to get him the relief he desperately needed. The rest of the work day seemed to fly by as I was almost giddy from the impact I seemed to have on Bob’s life. Over the years, moments like this have helped me realize that I needed to pursue a career that would allow me to help give someone their life back by solving a multidimensional problem that originally seemed impossible. I have realized for me that career is medicine.

Whether it be creating a cheaper medical device to increase access to its technology, trying to address the financial barriers to healthcare, or helping a patient through their most vulnerable moment, I have realized my desire to empower people who feel powerless is central to my goals as a future medical professional. A career as a physician will not only allow me to continue helping underserved populations, but also enhance my capacity to provide them with the medical care they deserve. After completing my masters and overcoming adversity throughout my college education, I feel incredibly humbled and prepared for obstacles I may face during my medical journey, and I am thrilled at the prospect of continuing to innovate and learn along the way. Finally, I strive to one day provide patients with the same superior care I received alongside teams of compassionate physicians and healthcare professionals.","When I first started college, I struggled heavily with my sexuality so one of my friends suggested that I come to an ALANA Collegiate Association (ACA) event with her. ACA is an organization that is devoted to supporting and advocating for all minorities that is open to anyone who wants to support these communities. While ACA did not have many other LGBTQ+ members, I was able to sympathize with and comfort other members of the organization due to my personal experiences with discrimination due to my sexuality. I made lifelong friends within this organization that helped me slowly come to terms with my sexuality and accept myself for who I truly was as a person. While participating in these events, I also learned a lot about various different cultures and backgrounds which helped me expand my worldview and opened my eyes to some of the disparities that exist in healthcare.","As a homosexual male, I struggled with accepting my sexuality throughout my childhood. During college, I found a sense of community within the ALANA Collegiate Association where I formed lifelong friendships with amazing people from diverse backgrounds. After graduating from RIT, I decided to start the non-profit Your Health Matters, Inc. alongside some of these friends. Since starting the organization, we have raised several thousand dollars to support free clinics in the local D.C. and Boston areas, and we have several donors who have pledged larger donations after our 501c3 status is approved. We also have started to recruit volunteer physicians and residents from different specialties with the hope of launching a virtual free clinic by this coming January. During and after my medical education, I would like to continue to grow my non-profit, with the help of my executive team, to hopefully increase our impact on communities in need. ",,,1,"During the pandemic, I struggled to find in-person volunteering opportunities so I started volunteering as a virtual tutor for Reading Partners. Even though we could not meet in person, this opportunity allowed me to work with children from underserved communities in the Washington, D.C. area and help them catch up to their peers in reading. I also struggled to find shadowing opportunities, but was thankfully able to shadow a neurosurgeon toward the end of 2020. In addition, my original MCAT was delayed by seven months because testing sites were closed. As I studied for my first two MCAT exams, I realized I was having issues focusing on tasks for long periods of time. As a result, I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist to figure out a potential solution. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed me with medication to help me focus.

Our parents struggled with opioid addiction, causing us to rely on government assistance programs and live in inadequate conditions. I matured quickly because I had to care for my siblings. Unfortunately, our parents passed away while I was in middle school, but we were cared for by our extended family, mainly our grandparents and great-grandparents. Leaving my hometown and siblings to go to California for school was difficult. I was in a foreign setting, and being overweight with cystic acne diminished my confidence. During this period, I also dealt with recurrent infections since my kidney was removed. I found it challenging to create a community for myself and struggled during my first two years in college, but I persevered. Finally, I met with a dermatologist and urologist to improve my health.

As my great-grandparents and I passed the farmland, the countryside became barren, and the arduous three-hour journey from Roswell, New Mexico to Lubbock, Texas, began. We frequently drove to Lubbock to see their dermatologist, and the trip always felt like an eternity. Traveling for health care was one of the challenges of living in a rural area. However, our incredible doctors made the trip worth it. Dr. B would hold my grandmother's hand while greeting us, creating a warm environment. I was curious about what she would inject into their skin and the various machines she used. Once Dr. B noticed I was interested, she explained the preventive skin cancer procedures. Although they would leave with many incision marks or occasionally reconstructed ears, she made the complex processes seem effortless and painless, which fascinated me. Afterward, I would put vitamin E oil on my grandpa’s scars so I, too, could be a part of the healing process.

My interest in medicine began with my childhood experiences, and they eventually led me to study biology and public health. However, my path to becoming a physician was firmly established during the Christmas break of my junior year. My grandpa had a stroke and needed significant help due to his limited mobility. Being the main provider for the family, he was uncomfortable when others assisted him, but as I cared for him over my break, I made sure that he felt dignified. I read him a novel where the protagonist was a larger-than-life cowboy, much like him. I also cooked lunch for him and rubbed lotion on his cracked hands. My family and I installed ramps and found ways to make his life easier. Over time, I could feel his spirits lifting. Taking care of my grandpa, I realized I had a direct and positive impact on his energy, emotional state, and physical strength. My dream of assisting others was reinvigorated when his health improved. I wanted to find ways to continue to connect with individuals and assist them in times of suffering to help better their lives.

Later, I had the opportunity to work as a medical scribe for an orthopedic surgeon in my hometown. Most of the patients in the clinic were older and suffering from chronic conditions. I had the pleasure of getting to know them while observing their progress. “Mercedes” shuffled down the hall with a distressed expression. I greeted her in Spanish, which seemed to put her more at ease. I asked about her morning, and she told me she made fresh tortillas for her grandchildren, just like my grandma would do. I told her how lucky they were, and she perked up as we laughed. Over the next five weeks, she received treatments for her shoulders, back, and hip. The procedures pained her, and physical therapy made her occasionally frustrated, but we supported her and encouraged her to persevere. I always checked on her before and after each appointment. After the last procedure, I checked on her to ask for a percentage of hip improvement. She was swaying and did a little salsa dance. She held my hand and happily told me that she was essentially free of pain. I was elated that she overcame years of pain and immobility. Witnessing Mercedes overcome these health obstacles allowed me to experience the passion and joy for helping others heal, much in the same way I did when I helped my grandpa.

Often in the clinic, patients would tense up hearing they needed another procedure or test. “Clay” needed a bone density evaluation but was worried about taking time off work since he had to drive an hour to the city. He asked me where he would have to go for his tests. I explained that everything could be done that day in the clinic. He relaxed with a smile. I was delighted by the structural advancements that Dr. O had implemented, such as the addition of the bone health clinic, which made this possible. This moment motivated me to continue working with dermatologists to explore the usefulness of telehealth for underserved patients without the time or money to visit doctors. Also, many were hopeless about their particular skin condition, as some do not have definitive treatments. The clinical trials for creams and phototherapy proved effective, and I was able to see patients’ confidence and quality of life improve. All of the doctors I worked with created innovative solutions for the obstacles that patients face, which is something I also hope to achieve.

I value every opportunity I have had to make even a small impact on the health outcomes of others through compassionate and dignified care. However, I want to have a greater impact on patients' quality of life as a physician; I continuously see doctors heal patients and enhance healthcare services through innovative means, and this is what I desire to do. Growing up in a rural community instilled my values of compassion and generosity and taught me the importance of good health. I believe one’s environment should be a place of refuge that promotes better health outcomes. I hope to channel these beliefs to become a physician that attentively serves others, ensures quality and accessible care, and strengthens my patients’ community.","During holiday breaks, I would stay with my best friend, ‚ÄúJasmine,‚Äù and her family. Her mother was in remission, and I would hear her using the juicer every morning to make ‚ÄúJamu,‚Äù an Indonesian health drink. I was taught about other remedies and Kerokan, and we discussed how she felt religion was crucial to her healing. This reminded me of the ‚Äúhealing circle‚Äù my great-grandmother would do when someone was ill. Jasmine‚Äôs family would visit the US often and teach me about Southeast Asian culture, expanding my world views. I had an appetite for new experiences, such as traveling and learning new languages. These experiences helped to define my goal of becoming a physician who tries to incorporate patients‚Äô cultures and traditions into their care, so they can feel safe and understood. I hope to teach my classmates about some Southeast Asian and Hispanic traditions, as well as learn what I can about other cultures to ensure all patients feel comfortable. ","I have actively participated in efforts to increase health equity and provide underserved patients in my communities with care. For instance, in my hometown of Roswell, New Mexico, I worked as a Medical Assistant in an Orthopedic and Spine Clinic. I had the privilege of serving under-resourced patients, such as farmers, the elderly, and the Latino community. We promoted bone health evaluations due to the elderly population's vitamin D deficiency. An MRI machine, OR, and physical therapy center were added to the clinic so patients from rural areas did not have to travel to multiple facilities. These were important services implemented to ensure that patients could access care regardless of social, economic, or environmental conditions. I learned that to successfully provide high-quality care, it is essential to build relationships with patients and assess the social determinants of health to understand what is lacking in the healthcare infrastructure. ",,,1,"The pandemic was challenging since my grandfather suffered a stroke, and my siblings had low enthusiasm for school and could not play sports. Even though I was busy with work, graduate courses, being a caregiver, and starting MCAT prep, I created a schedule for my family filled with activities and meal plans. Also, our 80-year-old neighbors had little social interaction, so in the evening, we would stand at the other end of the yard to help feed their cats and chickens. We couldn‚Äôt hear one another well, but it symbolized unity and connectedness. I believe these experiences have better prepared me for medical school since I learned I have strong coping mechanisms for stress as I made time for my physical and mental health to better serve my community and spend quality time with my family. It also shaped my desire to help those in vulnerable positions by listening to their needs and providing social support.",1,1,1

He was always tinkering at his workbench, trying to improve something, or stopping by friends’ homes to fix cars or furniture. Once, exhausted after a long day shopping in Chinatown, we drove by an elderly man looking sadly under the hood of his Camry in the parking lot. My grandfather pulled over to talk to the man. Thirty minutes later, my grandfather closed the Camry’s hood, the engine roared to life, and the now-beaming old man shook my grandfather’s hand. When Grandpa returned to the car, I asked if he knew the man; he did not. 


“So why did you fix his car?” I asked.

“I had a toolkit, right? So I might as well help.” 

It was more than just his tools — my grandfather’s example and words motivated me to help those in need, regardless of who they were and whether I knew them. 

So I made my own “toolkit,” upgrading my pencil box with extra pencils, scissors, glue, anything. The next week, when one of my classmates didn’t have the worksheet we were asked to print the night before, I handed him the extra I’d printed. His glum expression lifted, and I felt rewarded, knowing that I could help in his time of need. 

As fulfilling as helping others made me feel, I didn’t think about medicine until one day in high school. That night, when my grandmother failed to join us for dinner, my grandfather went to check on her in their basement bedroom. After a moment, we heard a loud howl and hurried downstairs. Grandma lay motionless on the floor, a knife in her hand, a deep, bleeding gash in her stomach. She had a history of mental challenges and had tried to harm herself. While my family rushed in to help, I stood paralyzed, afraid. Grandpa knelt beside her, pressing the wound. When the paramedics arrived, I watched them work quickly, using their equipment to stabilize the bleeding.

Luckily, my grandmother recovered. But the experience changed me. My grandfather, who seemingly could fix anything, could not aid his wife when she most needed it. In life-threatening circumstances, it took more than a commitment to helping others. A toolkit, I understood, was more than physical tools. I wanted to be like those paramedics, with the skills and knowledge to save lives. 

Thus began my journey to becoming a medical professional. In college, I searched for ways to build my medical knowledge. I studied to obtain certifications, eventually taking a course to become an EMT. What I learned made me more confident about responding to medical emergencies, carrying Narcan to music festivals in case anyone overdosed. My desk drawer and backpack held full first-aid kits. When my grandfather cut his finger badly on his workbench, I quickly staunched the bleeding and bandaged the cut. “Good thing you were here,” he said. 

Later, working as an EMT, I was at the heart of the action and had countless opportunities to help those in need. When the 10-month-old we brought to the hospital exhibited a cough consistent with croup, I knew to administer O2. “You probably saved that kid’s life,” the nurse said. I walked out that night feeling a sense of both pride and peace: I knew I’d found the most fulfilling career path for me.  

The next big step on my path came when John, a 55-year-old man, went into cardiac arrest as we drove him in the ambulance. I instinctively grabbed the AED and began CPR. As my EMT team delivered him to the emergency room, the medical team scrambled to their positions. Amidst the chaos, the doctor set a plan and kept everyone calm and focused: “Intubate him…start the line…prepare the LUCAS device.” Despite their best efforts, John didn’t make it. 

Afterward, I sat in the ambulance, sad for John and his family but also because I wanted to do more. I had done all that I could, but there was so much more for me to learn, to know. I thought about the ER physician, who’d acted calmly and confidently amidst the chaos. I realized that being a physician required not just extensive medical expertise, but also the experience-based confidence to make the right decisions in the most stressful situations. I knew I could acquire these attributes only by studying medicine.

My feelings were confirmed months later when I shadowed emergency physician Dr. Hiraoka. Going from room to room, we saw patients with wide-ranging complaints: abdominal pain, nausea, stroke recovery. Despite the variety of problems, Dr. Hiroaka asked smart questions, developing clear recommendations and next steps for each patient. It made clear to me that I wanted to be in his shoes.

My career vision is to solve medical problems on a daily basis, working with a dedicated team committed to saving and improving lives for patients and their families. Becoming an EMT confirmed my strong interest in medicine and provided a starter set of tools. Becoming a physician will equip me with the tools and knowledge I need most.

I’m eager to grow my medical knowledge, communication skills, and confidence, to better care for those in dire need — work inspired years ago by my grandfather, and the trusty toolkit he carried wherever he went.","In May 2021, I began working as an EMT in Chicago, largely serving underserved patients. _x000D_
_x000D_
Their situations and stories stayed with me. For example, Sam, a 68-year-old COVID patient I drove home from the hospital, had recently been laid off from custodian work and lost her sister to COVID. She said she‚Äôd probably just try to improve her diet to stay healthy, since she lacked insurance and now had no job. Still, Sam was in good spirits, telling me about her brother‚Äôs big sports-bet win, asking me about my life. _x000D_
_x000D_
When we reached Sam‚Äôs house, her family came out smiling, offering me a few crumpled dollars as a tip. I politely declined, telling them to take good care. It was a reminder of how hard those in greatest need are hit by health issues, and why I want to do my best to help. In addition, Sam‚Äôs perseverance in the face of hardship also reminded me of the strength of community, even in the most challenging circumstances.","In June 2021,  I helped start Ivy Garden Adult Activity Center, a senior community center in Chicago‚Äôs Bridgeport neighborhood, which houses many lower-income Asian Americans._x000D_
_x000D_
Inspired by past experiences working with low-income populations (such as with KDSAP) and helping my grandfather, I envisioned a safe, welcoming space where seniors could socialize. _x000D_
_x000D_
To launch, I led the team to discuss schedules, activities, and space allocation. I personally purchased amenities, created brochures, arranged transportation, and organized events. After talking to area seniors, we realized many lack primary care, so I helped create a partnership with Oak Street Health, bringing physicians in monthly for check-ups and other care. _x000D_
_x000D_
Today the Center serves 40 regular members. I love seeing seniors‚Äîincluding Grandpa‚Äîplaying mahjong, ping-pong, and competing at a riddle game I created, laughing with peers. I‚Äôm proud to have fostered this community that benefits a growing population dear to me.",,,1,"When Berkeley went to all-remote instruction in spring 2020, I was thankful to return to a stable home and work toward academic/career goals, ultimately reinforcing my commitment to medicine. _x000D_

Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt keep the California-based EMT position I‚Äôd secured, since I would be away from the state for an indefinite period. That same uncertainty made me hold on seeking EMT positions in Chicago immediately. _x000D_
_x000D_
Instead, I volunteered again with Ivy Garden Learning, the tutoring center where I‚Äôd previously worked. There, I held online office hours for elementary-school students and found creative ways to engage them, such as using YouTube videos on the Civil War and asking questions like ‚ÄúWhat would you have done if you lived in the South?‚Äù During that time I also grew my video-editing and kickboxing skills._x000D_

Like many autistics socialized as girls, I grew up as an expert at social camouflage and was not diagnosed until adulthood. Despite my late diagnosis, being autistic has shaped how I relate to others, specifically those with disabilities, and is inextricably linked to why I want to pursue a career as a physician. 

In college, I worked at an after-school center for developmentally disabled youth. I had known I wanted to be a doctor since I was a teenager, but it was my experience at this job that sparked my interest in developmental-behavioral pediatrics (DBP). Through an autistic coworker, disability studies classes, and the online autism community, I learned to view autism through a different lens—traits instead of symptoms, accommodations instead of conformity–that I aspire to bring to the field of DBP. I learned about myself through my students and committed to using my arbitrary position of power to advocate for them when their voices were so often disregarded. For example, when a coworker was speaking disparagingly to a student about her dermatillomania, painting it as non-compliance, I intervened. I took Ava aside, gave her a fidget toy to occupy her hands, and calmly asked if I could help bandage her wounds. With her consent, I was able to care for her. I want to become a pediatrician to work with disabled and other marginalized children in a way that honors their autonomy and affirms their personhood.

I first became interested in working with people experiencing homelessness due to the large overlap between houseless, disabled, and LGBTQ populations. As I delved deeper into the work, my motivations morphed; I saw that all people deserve to have their needs met, not just those with identities that match up with mine. When I think about becoming a doctor, I think about the people I serve in community health care and how it would feel to be able to provide comprehensive medical care for them in a way that is non-stigmatizing and rooted in compassion. I think about Vick, a 70-year-old man who lives in a garage by my old apartment. “Hi mom,” he said one night at the needle exchange, “can I please get a couple bags of 29s, toothpaste, and a sandwich?” A fellow volunteer told me to get him 28 gauge syringes instead. Vick protested, flustered that he wasn’t being heard. I got Vick the 29s. Through moments like this, of listening to and affirming Vick as an expert on his own needs, I have been able to earn his trust over the years. Developing relationships with patients who have been previously mistreated by the healthcare system in order to provide them with care is something that drives me. 

After college, I continued my work with disabled and houseless populations by taking a job as a case manager at Lifelong TRUST Clinic. Recently, I was filling out a form with a patient, copying down his disabilities, when he asked, “what is intellectual disability (ID)?” I used overly academic language in my response. When he left, I immediately researched “how to tell someone with ID about their diagnosis” and reflected on my own experience getting diagnosed with autism, another stigmatized disability. Then, I called him to elaborate, using clearer language and providing examples of tasks someone with ID may need support with. Combining my medical knowledge with sensitivity for my patient affirmed my decision to become a physician and reinforced my belief that I would be able to relate to patients in ways that a non-disabled doctor could not. 

Another affirmation of my desire to become a physician came in the form of a phone call. My patient panickedly told me that she could not reach her boyfriend and that the clinic would not do her abortion without someone else present. I changed out of my work-from-home pajamas to spend four hours in a bleak waiting room. The nurse struggled to find a vein due to her long history of IV drug use and eventually, the procedure was done without pain medication. She came out crying and traumatized but relieved that I was still there. “In an alternate reality, I think I would be a really good mother,” she looked at me as I drove her home. “I think you would, too,” I said. I meant it. I felt fiercely sure of my decision to drop everything and support my patient that day. However, I wished that I could have done more. I wanted to be in the room with Angie, reassuring her, administering pain medicine orally, or even performing the procedure.

I want to go to medical school to combine my passion for the medical sciences with my devotion to equitable patient care. Through working and volunteering in community healthcare, I have gained extensive experience building rapport with some of the most marginalized people. I want to become a physician in order to provide patients with holistic health care that prioritizes their own desires. Whether I end up pursuing DBP or primary care, I believe that my lived experience of disability, pursuit of justice, and unwavering commitment to my passions would be an asset to the medical field. Ultimately, I believe that I would be an attentive and skillful doctor, not in spite of being autistic, but because of it.","As a freshman, I decorated my dorm room with a statue of Ganesh and Tibetan prayer flags. I grew up in an upper-class, white suburb in which Asian cultural and religious artifacts were used as decoration and associated with a primarily white counterculture. In an attempt to differentiate myself from others, I appropriated clothing, symbols, and art from Asian cultures._x000D_
_x000D_
One day, I was hanging out with my friend Isha and invited her over. She later told our mutual friend that my decorations made her uncomfortable. After our mutual friend brought it up, I read articles on appropriation and considered my own positionality as a white person. I realized that the belongings did not actually have a cultural or spiritual meaning to me, gave them away, and apologized to my friend. Due to my ignorance, I had caused harm. Now, I speak up when I encounter cultural appropriation from my white family and friends. I believe it is important to have these tough conversations in order to invoke change. ","As a community health worker, I have extensive experience providing care to people who have been marginalized by the healthcare system and are initially distrustful of me. By consistently showing up, listening, and keeping my promises, I am able to build relationships based on mutual respect. When I first began case management for a patient with end-stage kidney failure and severe depression, he would often answer my calls with ‚Äúwhat do you want?‚Äù and then hang up. I kept calling, going to his doctor‚Äôs appointments, and asking him about his favorite band. The other day, he called to thank me for helping him get an electric scooter and said he was excited to take it to the park. At his next nephrology appointment, he said ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù to dialysis when he had previously been vehemently against it. By listening to my patient‚Äôs priorities and providing consistent follow-through, I was able to show him that I was someone he could rely on, ultimately helping him build enthusiasm for his health. ",,,1,"Due to COVID-related clinic closures, the research project I began coordinating my Junior year (on barriers to accessing services after a developmental-behavioral assessment) was greatly delayed.

I planned on completing this research study in the Fall of 2020 and then starting my honors thesis on the effects of disability-neutral language during a developmental-behavioral assessment on parent and child attitudes about disability. Due to COVID, I did not have a reliable research project to do an honors thesis on.

At this point, Mila had been an inpatient at Sheppard Pratt, the psychiatric hospital at which I work, for almost a month, yet showed little progress in her treatment. She was triggered so regularly into flashbacks and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) episodes that she required constant staff surveillance. Twice earlier that evening she had rolled her wheelchair down the hallway in an attempt to isolate and self-harm as my colleagues and I begged her to talk to us and use the coping skills we had taught her during group therapy instead.

Mila was skeptical of hospitals and doctors, and she invested in her treatment only intermittently. In and out of psychiatric hospitals for most of her life, she was understandably doubtful that her treatments would enable her to live outside of a hospital long term. Stories like Mila’s were common throughout the hospital. One man refused blood work because he thought he would be secretly injected with medicine. Another woman turned down meetings with her treatment team, citing dismissive behavior by clinicians in past hospitalizations.

I have seen firsthand what is at stake when wariness and distrust prevent people from seeking out vital care. I remember the feeling of helplessness as I argued with my grandparents over the phone, trying to convince them to see a doctor after hearing my grandfather slurring his speech on one of our weekly calls. Having lived through decades of volatility in Philippine health systems due to widespread corruption and a diaspora of Philippine-trained healthcare workers, they no longer trusted doctors and ignored the severity of his condition for days before our call. Thousands of miles away, I listened as my grandparents insisted that his symptoms arose from a cold and nothing more. In the end, a combination of emotional and logical appeals finally convinced them to seek medical help for his stroke, but the fear that their distrust of physicians could stop them from getting urgent care in the future continues to weigh on me.

In college, my experience working on a clinical research team investigating barriers that prevent people from getting vital care allowed a scholarly interest to evolve out of this existing concern. Through interviews and surveys, we examined how health literacy levels can affect a patient’s reluctance to seek out or continue treatment for cancer. Patients spoke about how limited communication or incomplete explanations of treatment details made them feel like they lacked agency in making decisions about their care. Dr. McGuire, the principal investigator in this team, taught me how providers can contextualize treatment plans to show how they fit into a patient’s life, turning each visit into a collaborative process. This contextualization was only possible after establishing rapport with her patients – learning about their lives as well as their medical history.

Later, when I started working at Sheppard Pratt Hospital and engaged in regular one-to-one staff talks with patients, I discovered the joy of making those interpersonal connections with patients, learning about their stories through laughter, tears, and everything in between. I held the hands of parents as they told me about their struggles to mend family ties broken by addiction, abuse, or abandonment. I worked with teenage patients to design safety plans after they voiced anxieties about discharge placements and relapses outside of the hospital. 
 
Ultimately, it was those types of conversations that I had with Mila in the past that gave me the tools to help her avoid a third crisis that evening. Stuck in the corner of the hallway, with my hand pressed against the wall to cushion her headbanging as my colleague struggled to slide a helmet over her head, I engaged with her different personalities, a symptom of her DID that emerged during flashbacks. Using my knowledge of her likes and dislikes, I was able to urge Mila to come forward, and together, we talked through a containment strategy that allowed her other personalities to recede, restoring a safe mental environment for her.

Mila’s avoidance of a third crisis that night was only a small, temporary victory in her long-term treatment. Looking back, however, it illuminates a fundamental desire conceived through interactions with my family and strengthened by my experiences: I want to connect with people in order to support them and help them access the resources they need. Patients are often in an unfamiliar, vulnerable position when they seek care. By working to close communication gaps, physicians can serve as guides, helping patients navigate unfamiliar territory and giving them the tools to advocate for themselves. I also aspire to have the necessary scientific expertise to support patients beyond holding their hands in difficult moments – to tangibly help them while putting them at ease. My experiences working with underserved populations have given me insight into the role I hope to play in achieving these ends: to build bonds of trust that create an open dialogue in treatment planning, giving patients power over their own health.","Although many people have preconceptions about psychiatric hospitals from the media, psychiatric in-patients are not at all different from people outside of the hospital. At my job, I talk with patients about their hopes and dreams, which are largely the same as yours or mine. What separates most psychiatric in-patients from people outside is untreated trauma and mental disorders._x000D_
_x000D_
It is not always easy to remember this. I have had to develop a thick skin for insults and threats. Being the recipient of a patient‚Äôs abusive behavior in the unit or discovering that they committed some heinous act by reading their chart, you can start to doubt the hospital‚Äôs capability for rehabilitation. The reality, however, is that these patients are simply people put in some of the toughest moments of their lives by society‚Äôs neglect. Seeing the accumulative effects of these disorders and traumas, I have a better understanding of the immense fortitude needed to overcome them.","As an Organizer for Tutorial Project, I helped design new cultural competence trainings for tutors. I aimed to minimize bias and teach tutors to meet their tutees where they are academically without imposing their own expectations. I taught tutors to tailor lesson plans to each tutee, which often required teaching foundational content even if the tutee is in a grade level that normally teaches advanced skills._x000D_
_x000D_

Her scream rattled her living room’s windows and her tremors shook her unstable hospital bed. With the inability to administer any medical treatment as a hospice volunteer, I reassured her that her nurse and physician were on their way. After I spent many minutes offering tranquil words, the 83-year-old-woman started to relax. Once the physician arrived, an IV was started to alleviate her dehydration. Due to her recurring battle with infection, I increased my amount of visits. Medical uncertainty can be eased with a calm voice but ultimately needs an advanced team of physicians—I wish to be an essential part of both.

	My interest in service began when I was 10 years old. At this age, I cherished the time I could spend on the basketball court—however, I yearned to share my hobby with my physically disabled father. This was only a dream until we came across a video of wheelchair basketball. After finding a gym that would allow us to use wheelchairs on their courts, we spread the word and within a few months we had a team. I was focused on playing with my dad; this focus manifested as a drive to start a team. Unbeknownst to me, my narrow ambitions of playing with my father would shift when a boy with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, as well as many military veterans, came to play on the first day. I slowly started to understand the opportunity that was made for many people, like my father, to heal through sport. This small realization ignited my path towards service for people with disabilities which would then later evolve into a passion for medicine.

	After several years of developing this wheelchair basketball team, I found myself packing my car for college to begin my journey towards becoming a physician—a goal that I was excited to learn more about. My understanding of medicine started to take shape upon working in the Waco Center for Youth Rehabilitation Hospital and meeting a 14-year-old boy who recently committed a significant crime. As I approached him for the first time, he was sitting in a shadowed gray room, and he had dark brown scars on his face and arms that he attempted to cover with a Ninja Turtles jacket. He deserved much more than the path he was led down. I sat there listening to him talk about his crime, his past, and his desolate future. I felt powerless; there were not many actions I could take to assist due to the nature of my position. As I talked him through the possibility of a better future, his demeanor started to shift. Our weekly conversations seemed to be a great comfort to him. Yet, I craved the ability to refer him to someone more qualified to treat mental health issues. Simply conversing with someone about their situation can be sufficient; however, in many situations, I wished I had the ability to administer medical assistance. Becoming a physician, for me, means increasing the possible modes of action I can take to help the vulnerable while keeping the mental and emotional health of the patient at the forefront.

       After working with patients throughout college, I started to truly comprehend medicine through a multivariate lens. This desire to understand the comprehensive approach to medicine drew me into conducting suicide research at Baylor University. Extensive studies have been done on the personal factors that lead someone to commit suicide, but I was interested in the factors that people generally had no control over: county-level external factors such as socioeconomics and urbanization. Many factors leading to poor health outcomes are beyond the control of a single person; however, through my previous and future research, I wish to shed more light on the factors affecting the public. Becoming a physician will allow me to consider these issues directly with patients, as well as spread awareness to others in my field.

      Whether it be through hospice care, a sport, a rehabilitation hospital, or research, my desire to assist others will continue to push me in the hardest days of learning and practicing medicine. Working in pediatric medicine or another field of medicine, I aspire to use my experiences to continue leaving a lasting impact on those around me and on my future patients.","Conversations with my father sometimes centered around the plight of children crossing the El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez Border. I played with other students that were born a few miles from me but were given a significantly more difficult set of circumstances to grapple with. This early exposure to international diversity showed me the importance of having role models that children can relate to and having circumstances that allow for the same opportunities regardless of someone‚Äôs background. _x000D_

My experiences have inspired me to become an AmeriCorps member in Amarillo at Heal the City Free Clinic. I decided to embark on this mission to assist uninsured patients and reduce the burden of healthcare expenses for many people who are struggling with living paycheck-to-paycheck.

At first, when I got the news that we were moving, I thought my life was ruined but over time I understood that my life was not the only one being uprooted; mom and dad were going through the same struggle. I wanted to help in some way to make them feel better, and the only way I knew how was to cook for my mom so she could enjoy a homemade meal without having to cook it herself. That meal sparked one of my greatest passions, cooking, as well as the realization that I loved helping others.
Fast forward a few months and I was adjusting to the huge city of San Jose, CA, a sharp contrast to the 8,000-population farm-town I grew up in. One of the first things I noticed was the large homeless population. This was entirely new to me, and I wanted to help in some way, so I packed food for them. A brown bag with some granola bars, a clementine, a bottle of water, and a few dollars from my piggy bank was what I brought to the homeless man next to the Safeway. I was initially scared since this was a stranger and as an ignorant kid, I thought homeless people were scary. But with my mom watching carefully, I gave the man his care package and nervously told him, “I hope this helps.” After seeing his smile and hearing his words of thanks, I ran off. After a few more encounters and some time, I overcame my preconceived notions about the people I was helping and was grateful to provide any help I could. 
During my teenage years and beyond, I worked with food kitchens to help homeless communities but when I started college, I had to pare back my outreach efforts to focus on school and determine what I wanted to study. I originally applied to college as a political science major but quickly realized that I was more interested in science. Having already studied physics and chemistry in high school, I eagerly delved into biology and realized it would likely be at the forefront of science and technology. My biology courses challenged me, setting the foundation I needed and amazing me with how seemingly random research regarding a single protein could have such an impact on our understanding of life as a whole. Reading research papers for a discussion course excited me to be a part of the force that makes these discoveries, thus leading to a research project in a lab. 
The group and I researched, and hypothetically developed, a detergent pod that would be far more effective at ridding college linens of the surplus of bacteria they house compared to common retail products. As my studies advanced, I learned about health and was fascinated by the different biological systems, how they synergistically function within an individual, and the variability between any two people. While engaging in research was fascinating, I craved the human interactions that I experienced when I was younger. This, along with the desire to improve the lives of others, led me to the revelation that the medical profession would be the best path to make a tangible impact on others. To put the proposition of medicine as a career to the test, I began volunteering at the Avicenna Community Clinic. 
As a free clinic for the under- and uninsured, I interacted with patients who gave me a unique perspective on the healthcare experience as they were often dealing with chronic conditions. It was important to the healthcare team at Avicenna to treat patients as people rather than just a symptom requiring medication. One Sunday a patient with a history of high blood pressure and diabetes came in complaining of fatigue and sluggishness that persisted even after being prescribed medications for his chronic conditions. Concerned that his medications were not working, he wanted to consider changing medication or receiving a higher dose. After a discussion with the patient, the physician recommended that we maintain the current prescription and dosage, but also incorporate exercise into his busy schedule by walking in place while watching tv.  The physician also recommended that he decrease how much bread he ate from three slices to one slice per day. Two months later he returned with such energy and happiness; the physician had not solely relied on medications to treat his symptoms, but considered his lifestyle to come up with the most effective treatment. Working alongside physicians and underserved communities was inspiring, and my dedication to becoming a doctor was cemented.  
The majority of my life I have helped others in need, beginning with snacks bags and food kitchens for the homeless and culminating with aiding the uninsured at Avicenna. My experiences helping others and my love of science and discovery have confirmed my interest in becoming a physician. Once I reach that goal I will make an even more tangible impact on those in need, and strive to provide the best care possible.","As a biracial individual, I have experienced many levels of discrimination, from being bullied for the color of my skin to regularly being the target of ‚Äúrandom‚Äù security checks. However, one act of prejudice stood out - when a classmate in high school bullied me for my Muslim upbringing. He regularly hit me and insulted my family with the names of Muslim terrorists. These targeted attacks surprised me. I wanted to match his physicality, but I maintained restraint and unsuccessfully tried to explain why his actions were harmful to me and an entire community. _x000D_
_x000D_
These experiences have made me aware of how painful it is to not be respected for my color and culture and have led me to be a more open-minded person. I bring this perspective to my patient care and offer respect and acceptance towards those with unfamiliar backgrounds or customs in order to avoid making people feel unwelcome. For me, I work to educate myself and stay informed on new cultures so that I may be respectful to all._x000D_
","For the last year, I have been volunteering with Habitat for Humanity on the Rodeo Creek Court Project, building 11 homes for low-income families in the Santa Cruz area; we have completed four thus far. I have been fortunate to contribute to every part of the construction process, from foundation work to installing cabinets. One of my favorite parts of this work is that the future home-owners are required to contribute 500 hours of ‚Äúsweat equity‚Äù in which they work on the houses they will soon live in. This allows me to get to know them on a personal level, hear their stories, and build relationships. I have seen the direct impact this project makes for these families; Luke and his wife lost their house to the wildfires in 2020 and the sense of stability and normalcy they have gained from working on their house and building this new community is invaluable. I am honored to be able to give back to my community and others by building new homes and improving families‚Äô quality of life.",,,1,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my time at the Avicenna Community Health Clinic ended prematurely. While in the process of moving onto the intake team, the clinic closed temporarily due to the country-wide shut-downs. Unfortunately, once the clinic reopened for virtual consultations and extremely limited in-person activities, there was no longer a need for new members of the intake team. Though disappointing, this pushed me to pursue clinical experience elsewhere. The strength and courage displayed by the EMS workforce during the pandemic inspired me to dive into emergency medicine as a path for further clinical experience. Working as an EMT during the pandemic has become a significant source of medical knowledge and patient experiences, better preparing me for medical school._x000D_

Around me, teams of people bustled past, each with a specific task in mind. It was the start of our senior year of high school, and my friends and I found ourselves gutting local houses that had been devastated by Hurricane Harvey. As I stood there catching my breath, I heard someone cry out behind me. Upon turning, I saw my friend Kaitlyn standing still, a wide gash traversing the side of her leg. She had accidentally cut herself on a piece of exposed metal in the cluttered work site. Feeling limited in my capacity to help, I assisted a few of the parents in applying pressure to the wound and drove with them to a nearby emergency room. As I watched the ER doctor access the wound and guide us through his plan of action, I felt the desire to become a physician materialize.         
This would not be the last time I would feel frustrated with my limitations. Throughout most of my undergraduate years, I worked as a resident assistant (RA) for my university’s dormitories. When the Covid-19 pandemic began to affect campus, my responsibilities as an RA expanded to include helping residents quarantine within the dorms. During the chaos of the early stages of the pandemic I watched many students relocate to their two-week quarantine; some with painful body aches, and others only a minor cough. However, beyond bringing them meals and informing them of on-campus resources, there was nothing more I could do. Assuring residents of their new living situation was simple but reassuring them of the nature of their illness was out of my reach.    
        As CDC restrictions began to loosen, I was able to shadow several doctors, one of them an orthopedic surgeon named Dr. Peterson. During one of our days at the clinic, we met a young man who was there with his wife and child. When we entered the room, the man held up his right hand to reveal the bloodied bandages covering the ends of his fingers. He proceeded to tell us about how the injury was the result of an unfortunate lawnmower accident. A clean diagonal cut of the blade had removed the tips of four of his fingers. It was apparent to me that the two were immensely nervous to receive Dr. Peterson’s opinion; and I soon learned why. The man revealed that he was an electrician and relied heavily on his hands. He was distraught at the idea of losing a job he thoroughly enjoyed and being unable to provide for his family. I was amazed by the comforting manner in which Dr. Peterson was able to guide the couple through their treatment options and envious of the level of trust they placed in him. Dr. Peterson would later go on to tell me that this procedure was relatively simple, and yet, I could not stop thinking about the direct and tangible impact it would have on the young man’s life. I realized that there are very few things people value above their physical wellbeing. And so, the ability to use medicine to restore a patient's lifestyle is one that appealed greatly to me. 

      I continued to pursue my goal of becoming a physician by volunteering at the Emergency Room of a hospital near my university. During my time there I was exposed to a diverse population of patients; many of whom were in considerable amounts of pain. On one occasion, I was asked to bring an extra blanket to one of the patients named Mrs. M. Upon entering the room, I encountered Mrs. M crying quietly by herself. When she noticed me entering, she quickly apologized and thanked me for the blanket. Reassuring her that there was no need to apologize, I found myself in a conversation about my time at school. It turned out that I was close in age to her son. Unfortunately, she continued to tell me that he had recently taken his own life following the death of his father in a car accident. As Mrs. M struggled to share her story, I could tell she was also struggling physically. She was in the ER for a suspected GI leak after a recent gastric bypass operation and simply sitting up was a challenge. I imagined what it must be like for her to experience pain in so many areas of her life. But there was nothing I could do to alleviate this pain except sit and listen to her story. And although being able to share these things with me seemed to lift Mrs. M’s spirits, I left that encounter wanting to be able to do more to help her. This feeling reaffirmed my decision to become a physician. A decision that would permit me to learn about the underlying mechanisms afflicting patients like Mrs. M, and hopefully help me alleviate some of their physical pain.   
       Although I have changed a lot during my time as an undergraduate, my experiences with patients and medical professionals have only supported my commitment to become a physician. Interactions such as my talk with Mrs. M, have shown me the value of being a source of calm for patients during stressful times. However, I also realize that I have a desire to do more for these patients. I want to be directly involved with their treatment, from start to finish. And I am confident that the knowledge and skills I will gain during medical school will enable me to address their pain and suffering.","One of my responsibilities as a resident assistant was to help facilitate a series of programs focusing on different cultures from around the globe. While I am a terrible dancer, my favorite program was an annual event called ""Dance Around the World"". Here residents and registered student organizations were given the opportunity to educate people about their culture through traditional dances, food, and activities. In the course of only a few hours one could go from learning ""Cenderawasih"", an Indonesian dance that imitates the birds of paradise, to ""stepping"", a form of percussive dance in African-American culture. Although it was not quite the same as traveling the globe, this program still offered those who attended, a window into some of the different ways of living that exist. I realized how grateful I am for these differences. I feel that talking to other students at these events heightened my respect for others and prompted me to be curious rather than critical.     _x000D_
","During the summer of 2020, I worked at a local food pantry. Most of my time was spent processing large quantities of food in the warehouse. Sometimes, I even worked in the kitchen to prepare meals for youth and senior lunch programs. While ultimately I knew I was helping to alleviate some of the stress felt by those facing food insecurity, since I had no face-to-face interactions with members of my community, I felt disconnected from the impact the pantry was making. That was until I was having a conversation with another volunteer and was approached by a lady with two kids. She explained that she had relied heavily on the food pantry to feed her family for several years now. After thanking us for all our hard work, she said she was at the warehouse because she had recently accepted a job that paid very well. Now she wanted to use some of her free time to volunteer at the pantry with her kids. We had helped her to support her family, and now she wanted to do the same for others. ",,,1,na,1,0,1

We relied solely on my mother’s income early on, qualifying us for federal assistance such as food stamps to ensure we had enough to eat. We lived in multi-family households in low income areas to afford rent. I shared one room with 4 others well into high school; growing up with domestic violence in a small space made it difficult for me to focus on academics, so I went to public libraries to do schoolwork. Without access to academic tutors, I often stayed up late to troubleshoot alone and stayed behind at school to work with teachers. After my parents separated, we transitioned to a single-parent household. Moving away for college shortly after was difficult for me, and I struggled as I navigated classes and my mental health with limited support.

When the Khmer Rouge communists seized power in Cambodia in 1975, they persecuted many – especially educated professionals like Tha, who was a physician. Forced to seek refuge in America, he continued his dedication to patient care by helping open a primary care clinic for his new community in my hometown of east San Jose. No matter what he faced, he took care of those around him – just like me.

Growing up as the eldest daughter of Cambodian genocide refugees came with adversity. My childhood was at the mercy of my father’s abuse. Despite the risk of becoming a target, I shielded my mother from his unpredictable attacks. Due to fear of law enforcement, I was taught to never disclose the realities at home. Being unable to use my voice to speak up was as traumatizing as the physical altercations. When my father lunged at me after I retorted I did not need the money I had repeatedly asked for to take my AP exam, I reached my breaking point. Our lives changed days after when I – at sixteen – decided that leaving “home” was safer than staying. I was the catalyst that ended the cycle of violence and fear, as my decision gave my mother the courage to separate from my father and provide the stable home we always wanted. Tha advocated for the voices silenced by the Khmer Rouge by continuing to provide medical care, and I advocated for my mother by overstepping my abusive father. My childhood taught me the importance of having an unhindered voice to communicate, process, and heal. It awakened my determination to educate and to amplify others’ voices, and revealed my grit. My interest in pursuing a career as a physician stems from my desire to use my experiences to advocate for the wellbeing of those whose voices are not heard in our healthcare system and abroad.

During a medical mission trip in the Dominican Republic, a doctor I worked with shared, “The treatment starts as soon as you start speaking.” This sentiment has stuck with me ever since – I saw firsthand how educating patients to boil the water they drink and launder with is treatment just as much as prescribing albendazole for pinworm when preventive measures are not taken. I learned that medical care goes beyond diagnoses and medications, as it is also the empathy needed to connect with others, and the education needed to inform and empower others to make appropriate changes for their lives. I carried this with me into my subsequent clinical experiences. From working in teams during medical mission trips abroad, to observing a surgeon speaking with a post-op nurse to check on his patient, I learned about the dynamic nature of healthcare, and saw how cooperation between unique roles is crucial for improved health outcomes. To solidify my decision to become a physician, I sought out further clinical experience as a medical assistant (MA).

My role as an MA at San Francisco Allergy, Asthma & Immunology has shown me the day-to-day realities of fast-paced ambulatory care, and the multi-faceted role of an effective provider. One patient’s story showed me how important it is not only to have a voice, but also to be heard and advocated for by the right person. Enduring ten months of excruciating, widespread hives, our patient had been repeatedly turned away from care and told to “take more Benadryl,” with no long-term action plan. At her first visit in our clinic, she expressed overwhelming encouragement and relief when our physician told her, “I know what this is. You’re in the right hands now.” I saw how healing it was for her to simply be advocated for. As an MA, I routinely checked in with her before injecting her medication. Our clinic was often extremely busy, but I learned to adapt and did not allow the pressures of the clinic to affect the care I delivered. I prioritized compassion in everything from providing a safe space for her to share, to a cup of cold water on a hot day. I shared in her frustration when her hives were so severe she was embarrassed to leave her house, and I celebrated when they did not recur for weeks. Now, she tells us, “I wouldn’t say that I’m back to normal…I’m better than ever.” Caring for her and many others over the last three years has taught me that so much of medicine is about the doctor-patient relationship: meeting patients where they are, and following through with compassion at the core of treatment.

My life experiences have taught me that having a voice is the single most important catalyst for achieving change, yet not everyone has the privilege of being heard. That is why I am on a mission to become a physician who advocates for the underserved, empowers them to use their voices, and ensures patient autonomy so that people feel in control of their own healing. A medical degree will allow me to pursue my calling, continue my grandpa’s legacy, and establish community-based care in the US and Cambodia to enable the change and healing in communities that I know first-hand is so crucial.","In 2013, I traveled to Nicaragua with Global Glimpse on a service-learning trip to expand my leadership skills and global perspective. To explore poverty in depth, we visited a landfill where I was shocked to see kids running around in the rubble, and shacks on the outskirts that they called home. To get to know our new friends, we all took a bus down to a clearing for a game of soccer. As we cheered, laughed, and gasped for air, our humanity showed through. No matter what language we spoke, or where we called home, I realized at our core that we were humans all the same. Humans who share basic needs like shelter and water, and who share values like respect. We were as alike as we were different. Before stepping on the bus to drop off our friends, I noticed one of the kids had scraped his knee. I asked a coordinator for bandaids, and was frustrated when I was told I could not help him. That day, I realized my ability to address and act on disparities in our interconnected communities.","On medical mission trips with Global Medical Training, I helped provide healthcare to medically underserved communities in Peru and the Dominican Republic in free health clinics. Under physician supervision, I helped obtain patient histories, measured vitals like manual blood pressures, and complemented physicians‚Äô acute care plans with education to combat preventable diseases. I learned the importance of primary and preventive care in addressing disparities in healthcare accessibility and outcomes, and came to understand how valuable patient education was, on topics as ""simple"" as proper hygiene. Our student delegations also donated needed medications, supplements, and supplies to these clinics and communities. For instance, we donated sunglasses in the Dominican Republic to help prevent common issues like pterygium. As education and healthcare are purposeless if they are not accessible, I strive to continue advocating for communities through active outreach and community engagement.",,,1,"Due to the pandemic, I was furloughed from my role as a medical assistant in March 2020, and unable to volunteer on another medical mission trip abroad.

Don moves his rook to h8, trapping my black king against the side of the board and ending the game. Don looks up at me, his eyes wide and his face blushing with excitement. Don’s hand trembles as he reaches out to shake my hand. I grab it eagerly, and smile at him. Don is my first student. He has finished his first game.
Don learned chess from a curriculum that I created by researching articles on memory loss and combining my own previous knowledge of chess. He had never played chess in fifty years as a farmer before he came to the Gathering Place, an adult day program for people with memory loss where I was a volunteer for over two years. When I initially approached the director for the opportunity to teach chess to their residents, I was denied on the basis that learning chess would be too difficult for those with memory loss. Yet, with support from scientific journals and a methodical curriculum where I would teach each individual piece on its own, I was given the opportunity to teach their residents. 
As I began to work more closely with Don, he began to show a passion for chess and other mental puzzles. Each week, Don found new puzzles and introduced them to me. He would also help me teach chess to other residents, encouraging his peers when they got frustrated. Though he was not able to remember his previous day, Don was able to find a new passion that helped him stay energized throughout the day. He was more social with the other residents and was more engaged in his daily activities. As a result, teaching Don not only had an impact while we were seated at the chessboard. It seemed to have a meaningful impact on his life. Working with Don helped me understand my motivations to become a physician: I want to help every patient find a passion for their own care. 
The first time I saw my philosophy in practice was when I shadowed Dr. Holmes. Dr. Holmes energized patients to their own self-care. He spent extra time explaining his treatment. After-hours, Dr. Holmes spent time teaching at-home exercises. He challenged each patient with personal motivators. Dr. Holmes would often go out of his way for his own patients by following up with referrals or adjusting his own schedule to meet a patient. But what stuck with me about Dr. Holmes was his ability to devise a treatment plan that was unique for each patient. Though two patients would enter with the same injury, their treatment would be different based on their own interests. I realized that a provider's ability to provide personalized, unique care was what made a patient passionate about their own care. As a result, I watched Dr. Holmes make meaningful change in each patient by using his position as a doctor to provide unique treatment that fit each patient individually. I realized providing unique treatment to make a patient passionate was an ability unique to being a doctor. 
Seeing Dr. Holmes’ ability to provide unique treatment motivated me to find my own way to give unique treatment while advocating for underserved patients. And so I embarked on a two year process that culminated in starting BuddyUp Tennis WashU, a college club that paired with a national organization to provide adaptive tennis clinics to individuals with Down syndrome. I researched BuddyUp Tennis, which teaches tennis basics but uses outside elements such as footballs to make the game more fun and manageable for athletes with Down Syndrome. I brought this organization to St Louis where it is the first BuddyUp chapter to be affiliated with a university. At the end of our first clinic, which involved over twenty five athletes with Down Syndrome, twenty five WashU students and additional members of the St. Louis community, parents of the athletes approached me and described how grateful they were to have our program, how it filled a void in adaptive programming in St Louis and how it motivated their athletes to seek a more active lifestyle. However, since our clinics were only once a week, parents requested more programming to keep their athletes active during the rest of the week. In turn, I started a Connections program, which allowed our students and athletes to stay connected outside the weekly clinics with weekly zoom meetings. These meetings gave the athlete external motivation to stay active outside the clinic. It also allowed for personal connections between our students and athletes. 
Seeing our program impact the community taught me the importance of advocating for underserved populations. It showed me the disparity in opportunity for populations such as athletes with Down syndrome. But it also emphasized that given the opportunity, underserved populations are just as passionate about their own care. On top of that, BuddyUp tennis emphasized the joy and satisfaction I get by making meaningful change in others’ lives. I believe that becoming a doctor will allow me to continue advocating, but more regularly and directly. 
From my time working with Don to starting our BuddyUp clinics, I have developed a strong motivation to become a doctor. I want to use scientific research to develop treatments that enable patients to be passionate for their own care. I want to advocate for underserved populations. I want to make meaningful changes in every patient I treat.","I am from Sheboygan Falls, a rural town of 8000 people, known for being close to the Kohler factory for toilets. So when I walked into Lake Country Academy on my first day of school, I saw no one like me. There was no one there who spoke Telugu, no one who sang carnatic music and no one who was vegetarian. So I had to adjust. I integrated myself into a culture completely different from the one I had at home while keeping the values that my parents instilled in me. I had to understand that my friends had to go to bible classes after school and respect that they could not hang out with me on Sundays.

One summer during my annual trip to India, my cousin and I were playing tag when he tripped and cut himself. We went to the local clinic, but they were unable to do enough; his wound soon became infected. We were advised to go to a hospital, but the nearest one was over an hour away. We eventually learned he actually had cancer and required amputation. This experience opened my eyes to the disparities in basic healthcare accessibility. In India, my relatives live in extreme rural conditions and I wondered whether sufficient healthcare resources could have prevented his amputation. Returning to America, I learned that the same problem persists in rural areas here and that the lack of advocacy for these populations is a universally pressing yet overlooked issue. I was invigorated to pursue a career in which I could speak out and actively assist these communities. 
 
With this mindset, I joined the social advocacy group CALPIRG in college. As a CALPIRG campaign leader, I encountered a family in Bakersfield living next to a fracking site. Many children in their community had become ill with asthma due to the toxic chemicals released by fracking. The families repeatedly wrote to community leaders to close the sites, only to have their grievances ignored by the oil and gas companies. I recognized that our support could uplift the voices of these families. We gathered petitions and ultimately met with legislators and the Kern county board of supervisors to garner support for our campaign for a buffer zone between fracking sites and sensitive areas. When we hit a campaign roadblock and lost support for the bill, I refocused our campaign to raise awareness and media attention. We wrote letters to editors and held a press conference to place pressure on local legislators to revise the bill and create the much needed buffer zone. My work with CALPIRG showed me how one person can have a major impact by simply rallying others to fight for the same cause. While working with CALPIRG allowed me to make a larger social impact as an advocate, it did not satisfy the personal connection I was seeking which I found in my work during the COVID-19 pandemic as a Cub Support tutor.
 
“No! Not math,” whined my student as she shut down and completely stopped responding to my questions. Seeing math problems made her shy and anxious. Once I realized she lacked confidence, I began with simple questions I knew she definitely could answer. Through experimentation, I found that she became most engaged when she could visualize the math. I taught her addition and subtraction using beads and a number line with a jumping bunny. My once anxious student soon excitedly waited for our sessions together. To ensure her continued success, I taught her parents how to help her supplement her school learning, and stressed that this would increase her confidence. Through my tutoring, I realized that I need to advocate for students with different learning styles so their potential does not go unnoticed. Yet teaching and making an impact on only one student’s life at a time was not enough for me – I wanted to be able to do more.
 
During my gap year, I combined my love for advocacy with making personal connections as a medical assistant at an ophthalmology clinic. Due to the pandemic, many older, immunocompromised patients were unable to come into the clinic to get their glaucoma and intraocular pressure checked. This was tragic for one patient as he went blind in one eye; when he finally came in, he was almost blind in his other eye. We immediately referred the patient to the glaucoma specialist, but even after my multiple calls, coordination between the specialist and the patient, and incessant follow up, the patient still had not been scheduled for surgery. Only after my plea for the ophthalmologist to personally contact the specialist was the surgery performed. This frustrating and disheartening process proved worthwhile as the patient has now gained a couple more years of cherished vision with his family. This interaction illuminated the importance of advocating for my patients by using my resources as a medical professional to open doors previously unavailable to patients. Finally, I found my place at the clinic, as I am able to champion the best care for my patients on a daily basis while personally teaching them about their eye health. My time as a medical assistant confirmed my dream to be a doctor because it showed me that I am pursuing a future in which I can constantly follow my passions of advocacy, teaching, and forming bonds with others.  
 
I aim to continue my work with CALPIRG and the ophthalmology clinic by persistently supporting patients both personally and on a larger social scale. As I pursue my goal of becoming a physician, I hope to always advocate for my patients and raise the voices of the commonly forgotten and underprivileged. I find immense fulfillment in knowing that my credibility and connections as a doctor will help me fight effectively for larger issues, creating a positive impact in the lives of individual patients and my community as a whole.","During the pandemic,  I volunteered as a tutor to help children of low-income families that didn‚Äôt have the resources to properly transition to virtual learning. One of my students was an active eight year old who was bright but had a short attention span. To help her stay interested, I turned the lessons into a personal game for her. I challenged her to do sets of problems as fast as she could and each time she would be more invested because she wanted to beat her own previous record. When my time tutoring ended, I got the chance to advocate for her specific learning needs by demonstrating to her parents exactly what they can do to help her stay attentive in school. _x000D_
_x000D_
Working with this young girl taught me to think from her perspective to come up with teaching methods that accommodate her needs. In the future, I will have to work with people who have different backgrounds than mine and it will be crucial for me to apply this lesson when choosing how to treat them. ","As I was growing up, I frequently visited my family in India who lived in rural conditions without access to proper healthcare. I wanted to actively stand up for people living in rural areas, so I joined Hygiene Heroes during college and created nutrition, sexual health, and hygiene curricula for schools in rural India. Since these communities didn‚Äôt have constant access to healthcare, my goal was to educate them on ways to prevent getting sick early on. I also joined a social advocacy group called CALPIRG where I led campaigns fighting to protect the environment. The most notable of all fought to create a buffer zone between fracking sites and sensitive areas such as schools to protect the health of young children from toxic fracking chemicals. Working with CALPIRG gave me the advocacy tools to continue fighting for such communities and to cause change in public health policy and bring better access to healthcare for everyone.  ",,,1,"The pandemic has caused many of my premed volunteer activities, shadowing experiences, and personal milestones like graduation to be virtual. The COVID-19 pandemic hit during my sophomore year before I could get any clinical experience. _x000D_

In addition to this, my MCAT date got postponed twice, however I used this as a chance to better prepare myself for the MCAT and I took it the first chance I got in the beginning of March 2021.

The lack of part time or student clinical positions during the pandemic inspired me to graduate a year early so I could work full time at a healthcare facility as a medical assistant.

Upon returning home, our relaxing day was interrupted by frantic messages and incoming calls from relatives in the U.S., asking, “Are you all safe?” We didn’t know what they were referring to; the local TV channels, run by the state, provided no information. You may recall footage about ten years ago of groundbreaking protests in the Middle East. Ironically, those of us who were physically there were barred from viewing these images by a corrupt government, refusing to acknowledge the decades of injustice that the country could no longer stay silent against. This was the start of the Arab Spring in Egypt and unknowingly the start of my path to medicine.

As a young adolescent during this tumultuous time, I lived in uncertainty and fear. We avoided leaving our building; however, I would accompany my siblings from one apartment to the next, visiting our neighbors and finding comfort in the stories shared. I would listen to “Karim,” a newly graduated cardiologist who lived two stories below us. Seeing Karim sneak out after the 7 PM curfew to help the wounded protesters expanded my view on what it meant to care for others and brought to light the role of a physician. Notably, it filled me with awe as we would gather in the early afternoon, and he would describe the non-stop care he provided protesters whilst I sat home comforting my younger siblings. I, too, wanted to be directly involved in helping people I knew were in need but also understood that at this time, my place was at home helping take care of my younger siblings.

In the eighteen days it took to overthrow a dictator’s thirty-year regime, I learned the value, obligation, and honor of caring for others at their weakest point. I understood that we could each play this role as my parents did with me, I did with my siblings, and Karim did with the protesters. Through Karim’s stories, I began to see medicine as the career through which I could best directly serve others and satisfy my intellectual curiosity.

Four years after being forced to leave Egypt due to further unrest, I found myself at the start of my college career. Seeing medicine as the intersection between the sciences I enjoyed and the advocacy needed to fight inequalities, I decided to become a scribe to learn more about the role of physicians. Our urgent care center saw patients from diverse backgrounds and was a pivotal resource for immigrant groups. Growing up in a family of immigrants, I understood the anxiety many patients expressed as they entered the clinic for treatment. Many only sought medical attention when absolutely necessary out of fear and lack of access.

One memorable experience was when “Leo” came in with his mother. Leo had hurt himself playing on the swings at school. As I entered the room, I could sense the mother’s distress and anxiety as she avoided eye contact and spoke in an apprehensive tone. I tried to comfort Leo and his mother by speaking about a similar accident of my brother’s that also required stitches and the minimal long-term impact it has had. The physician then communicated with the mother in her native tongue, Spanish, to comfort her amidst concerns over her legal status and self-blame for her son’s injury. Through our conversations, I could see her grow in ease and hope as she was assured that we would do all we could for her son and that her legal status wasn’t in jeopardy by visiting the clinic.

Through such moments, my interest in medicine and patient care grew. I understood the profound relief that medical knowledge, coupled with empathy and care for others, can bring to patients. It was through witnessing hundreds of physician-patient interactions that I was able to see a future for myself as a community physician, providing quality healthcare in a non-judgmental, supportive environment.

My non-clinical college experiences reinforced my vision. Throughout my Jesuit education, I was encouraged to focus on service and advocacy for justice. I began volunteering at my local food bank, where I saw firsthand the effects of the pandemic on those already facing food scarcity. My favorite part of volunteering was saving candy to give to children who were in line with their families. It was reminiscent of helping my mother prepare bags of sweets for our building’s children during the revolution. I reflected on the cohesiveness I experienced in Egypt and how the most difficult of times that test our community are circumvented with brotherhood and solidarity. The non-clinical experiences I am drawn to all connect back to the lessons I learned on the significance of being present for others during times of vulnerability.

I have never forgotten my experiences in Egypt, and they have profoundly shaped both my worldview and how I connect to others. There is power in the human aspect of our shared interactions, especially in times of hardship. My clinical and non-clinical experiences affirmed my career choice and helped prepare me for the challenges of medicine. I see myself as a future physician, continuing to serve my community. I look forward to lifelong growth, service, and patient advocacy.","I developed a unique perspective on how field workers conduct their work within the environmental science field. I spend most of my time in the field, working in manual labor, mainly climbing smoke stacks for testing. _x000D_
_x000D_
However, among my responsibilities is assessing toxin levels for technicians on site. I noticed some were apprehensive about environmental health. Through this avenue, I formed meaningful connections with many different from myself, worked with diverse teams, and enhanced my communication skills. For example, at a recent project at a concrete plant, I explained the need for monitoring for silica dust and the severe consequences that can arise and impact their respiratory health._x000D_
_x000D_
From my experiences in the field, I learned valuable lessons in communicating and earning people's trust. Fostering meaningful interactions with patients is my goal, and I believe my clinical and non-clinical experiences with diverse populations have well-equipped me for such an endeavor. ","In September 2021, I attended an event at my high school alma mater aimed at sharing alumni experiences with high school juniors. Following the event, many students sought advice about their college applications. The response inspired me to propose starting a mentorship program to the administration._x000D_
_x000D_
My alma mater is significantly under-resourced, with limited faculty to mentor students. I proposed instituting the program to facilitate meaningful relationships between alumni and students, focusing on career options and personal and academic skills. Furthermore, I wanted to utilize my experiences adapting to college in the program. Despite the value of attending a religious school and learning about one's faith, I believed enhancing students' cultural competency was critical._x000D_

I believe the lessons I learned in forming relationships and advocating for change will translate to a career in medicine. As I saw the tangible effects of advocacy, my motivation only grew to become a physician.",,,1,"Due to the pandemic, my family and I went through difficult periods financially. My mother lost both her jobs, and my TA position was canceled. I began working for DoorDash for about 30 hours a week in July 2020 and continued until I graduated.

His eyes crinkle in an obvious smile as he greets his patient.

In the background, there is a cacophony: a patient wails in pain, multiple heart monitors beep, radios go off, a nurse shouts so a hard-of-hearing patient can understand her. Our patient has been waiting for 3 hours, and her frustration showed on her face when we walked in. At first, she looks puzzled at his statement.

“My smile. It’s hiding,” he clarifies. 

“Oh,” the patient says, her demeanor shifting as she laughs. “I can see it in your eyes. My smile is hiding, too.” I can feel the room’s atmosphere lighten incrementally. I smile, hoping she can see it in my eyes as well, and introduce myself. It’s going to be a good day.

When I graduated from college, I knew two things: I enjoyed human biology, and I liked helping people. I had thought about being a doctor for a long time, but I didn’t know what it was really like to practice medicine. So, I decided to take 2 gap years, working as a medical scribe to give shape to the abstract ideas in my head about being a physician.

Scribing is unique because it gives a window into doctors’ daily lives, but also makes one a member of the healthcare team. Working side-by-side with an emergency physician for 8 hours a day, I am immersed in the process of diagnosing and decision-making. I’m also gaining a more realistic perspective of the difficulties and rewards of caring for sick patients. Some shifts are exhilarating; I have documented successful resuscitations, life-saving intubations, and STEMIs that were rushed to the cath lab. I’ve experienced the awe of watching color creep back into a patient’s skin when she was stabilized after arriving cyanotic and severely hypoxic. No other feeling can compare to being part of a team that saved someone’s life. I’ve also watched people die, held back tears as a son gently closed his father’s eyelids for the last time.

But perhaps most importantly, I’ve experienced the frustration and disheartenment that comes along with emergency medicine: an overflowing waiting room and a hospital without enough beds, patients who have no insurance and thus no access to primary care, conflicts within the healthcare team, noncompliant patients, and mountains of paperwork. Some shifts left our team drained and exhausted at the end of the night. Yet I always returned, ready for my next shift, knowing that I would continue to enjoy observing the challenges of diagnosing and treating patients. And no matter what specialty I end up in, I now have a more realistic view that my job will include helping patients navigate the complex medical system and educating them about available resources, just as I have watched the attending physicians do in the ER.

Before working as a scribe, I had been a physical therapy aide. Working at an outpatient physical therapy clinic, I developed relationships with some of our regular patients. In particular, I remember a patient with debilitating plantar fasciitis who attended our clinic for management of her chronic pain and difficulty walking. I was able to see her through the treatment process from start to finish. On her first day, I walked her through what to expect from interferential current therapy (IFC), and explained how it would help her with pain management. I saw her trepidation as she eyed the adhesive pads in my hands.

“It won’t hurt,” I was quick to reassure. “It’s just a tingling sensation. And you get to decide how intense you want it to be.” I loved explaining IFC to new patients. Here was a machine that shot electric current through the body, and yet instead of causing pain, it provided pain relief. It was gratifying to see my explanation reassure her.

As I helped her through exercises, I would listen quietly to her sorrow at not being able to walk on the beach anymore. One day, as we discussed her progress, she told me that she realized her healing process was not just physical, but also mental. This was the beginning of my interest in the holistic approach to patient care: viewing the patient as a gestalt, or a whole person, rather than a list of symptoms or a diagnosis.

I am grateful for my experiences, because they’ve allowed me a glimpse into the realities of being a physician, the moments that aren’t portrayed in TV shows. Before working in healthcare, I was a bit of a romantic about medicine. I was a bright-eyed university student sitting in the front row of my anatomy class, ravenously soaking up the names of bones and muscles. I thought that to be a doctor was to have knowledge, that the hardest part of medicine would be deducing a patient’s diagnosis. But I’ve learned through my work experience that scientific knowledge is just part of the foundation. I now understand other factors, such as how socioeconomic barriers prevent many people from having regular access to preventative care. I’ve learned how mind and body are intertwined, and I have come to appreciate that every patient I see is an infinitely complex being with unique circumstances. I can now say realistically that I want to be a doctor. I am determined to devote myself to medicine in all its aspects, including exhilaration, grief, frustration, and satisfaction.","During my internship with Teen Health Outreach in the Santa Cruz County Department of Public Health, my team taught sexual and reproductive health to students in the rural area of Watsonville, CA. They were at an alternative high school, meaning that the traditional school system had failed them, so they all faced unique barriers to learning on top of living in an area with health disparities. Since I attended high school in a more privileged area, I had to be open-minded in situations I was unfamiliar with, such as students not being able to complete their assignments because they needed to help their families during strawberry harvesting season. I liked the gradual process of building trust and rapport with individual students over several months and identifying how we could create a safer space to improve their learning experience. Above all, my experience showed me that it is essential to be open-minded and adaptable in education.","During my volunteer work in Nepal, I helped educate middle school and high school girls on feminine hygiene and distributed hygiene products. This enabled these students to continue their education instead of missing 25% of their school year, as was customary during their periods. Working with a local NGO under the supervision of a nurse, we engaged the students with educational materials to destigmatize their natural body processes. It was a small gesture that had the potential to make a long-term difference because we equipped them with tools to educate other women in their community. Our sessions were always awkward at first because most people were not used to talking about periods so openly. But as time went on, I noticed how students became more comfortable as we bonded over universal experiences. My experience inspired me to be an intern with my local public health department when I returned to the U.S., and I want to continue educating and promoting health in my community.",,,1,,1,0,1

A long-term IV drug user, Sara had been living with open wounds on both of her forearms. We were there with San Antonio Street Medicine to treat them. I held her right elbow in my left hand, my right tending to the wound running from wrist to elbow. She winced as I worked, so I spoke to her about growing up in South Texas and she told me what the Texas Hill Country was like in the ‘80s. She said her dog, “Bitita,” refused to sleep on the floor, and I called her a diva, and we laughed as I carefully rubbed on an antibiotic.

She told us that she had missed her last two appointments because she feared being judged by us, but now that she met us, she was grateful for our time. The doctor offered to put her on a weekly rotation, and she gave us the location where she usually slept. I continued dressing the wound and when the tape stuck to my gloves and I couldn’t remove it, we both laughed. We did not force her to endure a lecture or insist she ascribe to some sort of religious affiliation; rather, I sat there with her and her dog and the doctor as the noontime traffic went by beneath the South Texas sun. 

In 2007 I was on the brink of failing out of college — the result of shirking the responsibilities in every aspect of my life. I realized that I had to change, so I did, getting sober, and pivoting slowly to a life of service to others. I spoke in detoxes and at the Salvation Army, checked people into treatment centers, worked at a halfway house, and spent hours sitting with people who had a desire to change. Sometimes these people were friends of mine, but often they were strangers reaching out to anyone willing to lend a hand. These experiences have shaped my perspective and guided my life. But unexpected developments with my family made me realize the importance of a more integrated approach to support and healing.

In April 2017, my younger brother passed away due to an opioid overdose. The community surrounded us and we were met with love and support, but my family still struggled. It wasn't until a psychiatrist got involved that my mother came back to baseline and our family began to heal. The medical community helped us begin the long climb out of the fog. Watching physicians heal my family was transformative, and spurred me to think deeply about my career and consider how I could be most useful to my medically underserved community.

I had already been exploring a career change before my brother's death and was drawn to medicine even then. At the time, this interest was rooted in positive memories of a semester in high school rotating through the hospital, observing patient-doctor interactions. Seeing how physicians helped my family heal not just medically but holistically after my brother passed reaffirmed my desire to pursue a career in medicine. 

A few weeks ago, while I was volunteering as a clinical assistant at Hopelight Medical Clinic, a resident of a youth home came in for a yearly medication management appointment. He was quiet and seemed to have no interest in speaking with me or anyone else. My questions to him were met with short one-word responses.

As I reached for the blood pressure cuff and complimented his cowboy boots, it was as if a light went on. I told him I had a pair back home in Texas and he asked where I was from. He told me he wanted to get involved with the rodeo, and I told him about working on a horse farm in Arizona. He shared his life with me and I shared mine with him, and when I gave my report to the doctor he shook my hand. I enjoy meeting people where they are and doing my best to render aid.

As an MA, I am oftentimes the first person to interact with the patient past the front desk. They may be in pain; they may be scared, but it is my job to work through this so that the physician can provide the highest level of care. I love this; however, I want to do more. I know that as a physician I will not only be involved in the care of patients, but also trained to manage and monitor the health and wellbeing of my community.

I enjoy being placed on the front lines and falling back upon my humanity as I work with people who are seeking treatment. My experiences have made me adept at active listening, collaborative problem solving, and safety planning. I love working closely with patients, and I know that by approaching wellbeing from a physician's point of view, I will be able to treat and heal from a different perspective.

Switching careers is a decision I came to over a period of time that began with me as a sixteen-year-old in medical scrubs and continued through a life committed to service. My time shadowing, volunteering, and working has helped me reaffirm this commitment. I have spent years volunteering in classrooms teaching English to immigrants, offering conversation and a warm cup of coffee to the homeless and transient community, and I have given my time to help people get their life back on track, but I know there is more work to be done. Becoming a physician would be a continuation of this service work but would also allow me to help in a unique way: by attending to individual and communal suffering, through humanistic and scientific approaches.","‚ÄúRichard, would you mind going and checking in with ‚ÄòJay‚Äô?‚Äù Becky leaned in when she said it, pointing her chin to someone sitting at a table alone, looking exasperated.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed exploring the detail and historical context of each work of art. I took more art history classes, eventually adding the major, and found that it altered and enhanced my view of medicine. My favorite piece is a ceiling fresco in the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. The Franciscan vows – poverty, obedience and chastity – fill three sections of the fresco, and in the fourth St. Francis is seated in heaven. Every richly-hued detail is significant, but also the four sections together create a more powerful message than any of them on their own. This is how I view medicine: requiring knowledge of every detail, but practiced in the greater context of the patient’s life.

I knew I was lucky to be the only non-PhD working in Dr. Ashworth’s cancer genetics lab and was determined to make the most of it. My first task was sequencing cells to confirm whether CRISPR gene-editing had in fact deleted a BRCA2 coding region. I was meticulous at every step, and spent lab meetings googling terms to increase my understanding. I kept track of every research protocol in a notebook and added notes in the margins (like my own Harry Potter potions textbook). Participating in cutting-edge science at the institution where CRISPR originated, for the scientist who discovered BRCA2, felt important, thrilling.

Over four summers I progressed from googling every term during lab meetings, to running projects start to finish and designing my own primers. Figuring out which genetic errors dismantled control of the cell cycle and how to either correct them (eliminating the cancerous error) or damage them further (killing the cancer cells) was an appealing puzzle to solve. I loved the science, but increasingly I found myself drawn to the application of that research, the hope that one day each patient will get a targeted therapy personalized to their tumor.

I wanted to see where my lab work went, the patient side of medicine. As a clinical research coordinator I am where that science rubber meets the proverbial road, I mediate the chaos of clinic for patients on clinical trials. I am a patient’s first call for questions, scheduling requests, or a story about their son’s Halloween costume. Following them through clinic has provided an intimate view of cancer treatment and clinical research and how patients, families and the clinical team work together in search of a cure.

My first patient had recently been diagnosed with colon cancer, and now sat shifting in his seat with a list of questions and fidgeting hands. Dr. Van Loon started, not with cancer, but by learning about the patient's life. When she moved to talk about his particular disease her tone was serious but conversational. He ticked through each of his questions and the shifting and fidgeting stopped. Dr. Van Loon asked about his goals for treatment and what was most important to him. Then she described his treatment options, citing the supporting research and circling back to how each aligned with his priorities and goals. Her encyclopedic knowledge inspired confidence, and she considered every option in the context of his life. At that moment I knew I wanted to be a physician, one like Dr. Van Loon who focuses intently on her patient, sets his mind at ease, and provides that link from despair to hope.

Mia enrolled in my clinical trial and I adored her instantly. Graceful and passionate, I looked forward to hearing about her upcoming art exhibition or granddaughter’s band. Then Mia’s scans showed disease progression. Pain and nausea followed. Dr. Van Loon gently talked through Mia’s remaining treatment options, none of them great; then returned  to earlier conversations about what was important to Mia, what quality of life Mia wanted, and how further treatment was likely inconsistent with those wishes. It was a crushing and humbling reminder that some patients don’t get better, that cutting-edge science often comes up short. When Mia ultimately decided to discontinue treatment and enter hospice, she asked if Dr. Van Loon would still be her doctor. I will never forget the response: “Of course. I’m with you through this whole journey, for all of it.” I learned it’s not about wins and losses, that when cure isn’t possible we measure success by providing comfort, a little more time with family, and help finding peace. I want to show up for my patients, for the whole journey, even when there is nothing left to do but show up.

Working first as a researcher and then in the clinic, I have experienced the science that advances medical treatment and the care of patients who are at the center of it all. I have seen the ‘medical fresco’ - research, clinical care, and compassion - coming together like a 14th century masterpiece, into something more meaningful, something beautiful. And a career in medicine is all I can imagine doing. I want to be the whole picture, to provide patients with the best that medicine has to offer and walk with them for the whole journey, under the entire canopy of options, for all of it.","I didn‚Äôt overcome the distress of my childhood, so much as survived it and found its silver linings. Growing up with a volatile parent, I became adept at reading emotions and diffusing tense interactions. This has been a strength, working with patients facing life-threatening illness. After my father lost his job we wound up living in a friend‚Äôs garage apartment. At my private school no one knew I was on scholarship, let alone that five of us were now sharing 500 square feet. So I don‚Äôt assume to know what others face, I bring an open heart and mind to every room I enter ‚Ä¶ including dorm rooms. As a Sophomore Advisor my role was to support freshmen as they transitioned to college. I attended crisis management training and became suicide-prevention certified, but I didn‚Äôt expect to use those skills, Emory freshmen appeared flawless. I was wrong. Most confided in me things no one would suspect, looking at their shiny exteriors. We all have wounds, but we each scar a little differently.","Three generations of a Middle-Eastern family, six people in all, were packed into the compact car that stopped at my station. I asked who was getting a vaccine and after a minute of charades to overcome the language barrier, the answer was: all of them! I placed six stickers on the car window, and with laughs and smiles, they edged up to the waiting nurses. Helping at Ethne Health‚Äôs Covid vaccine clinic felt historic and fueled my desire to address health disparities. _x000D_

Through my health and non-health related volunteering, I‚Äôve learned that only when everyone has the opportunity to lead a healthy and productive life, will we attain the potential of our society. John Donne‚Äôs famous ‚Äúno man is an island entire of itself‚Äù rings true in that there are both personal and societal consequences to inequity. My experience with Matriculate, mentoring teens hoping to be the first in their families to attend college, reinforced that the issue is not aptitude or desire, but opportunity and access.",,,1,"While I experienced many of the universal challenges and losses of COVID-19 - canceled educational and work experiences, family financial challenges, and the serious illness or death of people I knew - none abruptly nor severely negatively impacted my medical school preparation. But the pandemic did afford me an opportunity I would not have had otherwise. Ethne Health is a community health clinic in Clarkson, GA (the most diverse square mile in America), whose patients frequently face language and other barriers to care. Under normal circumstances, there would be no role for a college student to check patients in and help them fill out forms, but these were unprecedented times. From a personal standpoint, it was a deeply moving experience. After a year of fear, sadness, and isolation, seeing people getting vaccinated was exhilarating. It felt historic, and I was proud to play a (very small) part in moving our country beyond the pandemic.",0,0,1
2023,15264836,,29,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"In 2002, my family and I immigrated from the Philippines to America due to generational poverty and limited socioeconomic opportunities. I began school in the US as a second grader and was placed in an English as a Second Language class until I advanced to regular classes. To provide for my twin sister and I, my single mother worked as a housekeeper during the day and as a caregiver at night. As a result, we were placed in the custody of close relatives and moved between homes often until I was 11 years old. My mother's solution to this was to move us to an elderly residential home where we worked full-time as caregivers. After school, I helped my mother with providing care for the elderly to lessen her workload. At the age of 16, I became a hairstylist to help pay bills. My decision to pursue higher education was shaped by ongoing financial instability and a lack of guidance. Despite these difficulties, I received the 2013 Top Teen Award for my city and graduated from high school with honors. I decided to attend college two hours away from my family in order to discover more opportunities and myself. In order to support my family and afford college, I worked three jobs. My path to success as a first-generation college student and immigrant was not linear, but I took advantage of all my opportunities.",U,0,1,"I was placed on academic probation twice during the Fall Quarters of 2014 and 2016 due to poor academic performance. I was a full-time student, worked two part-time jobs, and traveled home weekly to support my family. These responsibilities made it difficult to maintain my grades. On top of these obligations, I also experienced two unexpected losses where a close family member passed away in each of those quarters. It was also in Fall Quarter 2016 that I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It was overwhelming to accept my diagnosis at such a young age. Due to my immaturity and lack of emotional coping skills, I didn’t seek mental health care nor allocate the appropriate time to study. Consequently, my grades suffered. Reflecting on this experience, I regret not seeking help from my advisors, peers, and healthcare providers. The grades are a constant reminder of my lack of maturity and the sense of isolation and defeat I felt at the time. From this experience, I realized the importance of community support, coping skills, and emotional hygiene. As a result, I sought help from my mentors, family, and peers, which helped me do well in my post-baccalaureate courses. As I get ready for medical school and beyond, I plan to continue to learn and advocate for mental health and coping skills in challenging times.",0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,28970,1280.0,5300.0,363.0,14940.0,,1,5663,1,20240,07/16/2022,University of California-Davis,Biological Sciences,0,,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Less than $25,000",10,1,1,1,5.0,60.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,15,Significant,3,2023,3,1.0,1.0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"My small legs ached as I sprinted to the nearest drug store for those white pills that relieved my “Lola’s”, or grandmother in Tagalog, painful pressure on her chest. The fear of being too late pounded rhythmically to each of my steps. This was a normal occurrence in my childhood. With no doctors nearby, the only treatments were the pills, prayers, and the crushed herbal salves I massaged onto her limbs. In our rural village in the Philippines, it was a struggle to find care for Lola. Since my single mother worked in another village, Lola cared for my twin sister and me. In turn, we took care of her. She entrusted her dream of moving to America to us, in an effort for us to live a life that offered more than what was offered to her. She was my pillar of strength and compassion. With one suitcase and my Lola’s dream, my family and I started a new chapter. Upon departure, I vowed to return to Lola to give her the care and a better quality of life that she desperately needed.

Longing for familiarity, my family chose an agricultural town in the Central Valley of California. Due to poverty and cultural barriers, we lived in an elderly care facility as full-time caregivers. While my mother worked tirelessly, I was left to the warm, tender care of my adopted grandparents. I had the privilege of meeting people from different walks of life and enjoyed listening to stories about their families, dreams, and even their fears. On quiet days, I entertained them by theatrically re-enacting my day at school. In every interaction, I treated them like my own Lola and constantly yearned to learn more about the physiology of aging so that I could help them more. With Beary, a long-time dementia resident, I patiently listened to her love for figurines and her fears about falling. She always used humor to cope when she described falling as a “one way ticket to the funeral home.” Though I shared her fears silently, I eagerly reminded her that I would be honored to be her “personal cane”. Growing up with the elderly taught me how to comfort others by adapting to their language, beliefs, and past experiences. I learned to connect with people beyond their diagnoses. And I learned how it feels to lose someone twice when Beary slowly forgot me before she passed. I never grew accustomed to death, but I grew to accept and value my role in providing comfort and peace during the time I was by their side. 

Eager to continue this role in college, I joined Hmong Lifting Underserved Barriers Clinic, a student-run free clinic in Sacramento that cared for the underserved. I found my place as a patient advocate and translator for the marginalized like my family. There, I met patients like Sonya, whose pain didn’t need any translation. I saw the sweat that glistened on her forehead; brows that furrowed as she rapidly shifted her anxious gaze from me to the restroom. Her chronic urinary tract infection was intensified by her uncontrolled diabetes. I quickly reminded the clinical staff and urged them to check on her at their next available moment. For the next three years, I scheduled my shifts to match Sonya’s and many other vulnerable patients. I wanted them to be supported and heard throughout their visits. As a result, I was able to celebrate many healthcare milestones, like Sonya’s lowered blood sugar. Volunteering at the clinic taught me more than cultural sensitivity. It taught me how years of systemic inequities can manifest into worse health outcomes for minorities. I learned how heartbreaking it was to hear a patient cry because they had to choose between medications or their next meal. I learned how medical mistrust and unfamiliarity can impact treatment compliance. And I saw firsthand how the simplest gestures could inspire hope in patients to improve their health and their lives. 

Through these experiences, I found my life’s meaning in supporting others to live a healthy and quality life. With Lola, I felt proud to be her personal masseuse, believing with every knead and prayer that she would be healed. For Beary, I was grateful to be her personal cane, privileged to be spending her golden years with her. I felt fulfilled as I held Sonya’s hand during her vulnerable times, her gratitude forever engraved on my heart. By becoming a physician, I know I can make the difference I want for my future patients and ensure they get the best care possible. I lived with many elderly patients who suffered from advanced health conditions and who coped with inadequate medical care. I learned about diseases at the free clinic and how cultural empathy and the right medical care can help marginalized people. Because of this, I will advocate for legislation that expands access to high-quality medical care for all. And when I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, I realized there was nothing else I would want to commit my life to than being a doctor to help others go through their own health adversities. I will be there to listen and share in their grief and laughter. I will ensure that my patients are validated in their experiences and receive the quality care they need, despite costs and accessibility. Though I was not able to fulfill all these promises for my own Lola, I am at peace knowing that I will keep true to these promises for many others.","In a corner of our free student-run clinic for the underserved, a Hispanic patient waited for the doctor to see her for her diabetes. A Chinese patient anxiously explained that his ribs hurt to a medical student, while a Mongolian patient paced nervously in line to get checked in. This is what our typical clinic day looked like. Patients of different cultures, languages, and chief complaints come to us because they seek quality, accessible, and culturally sensitive care. In my six years at the clinic, I gained valuable experience in a wide variety of roles. Besides clinical knowledge, I also learned what desperation, abuse, emotional trauma, and fatigue can look like. I learned to meet patients where they are at, in regards to their beliefs. I learned to be patient with those who has never met with a clinician due to their background. Through this, I discovered how much quality care, cultural sensitivity, and respect can accomplish in improving health outcomes for patients.","To me, the inability to pay for healthcare services means that people do not seek preventative care and wait until later when they are symptomatic to seek the care they needed. Because of this, getting insurance is the most important social issue. It is the first step towards everyone's journey towards their optimal level of health. This is why I became a licensed insurance agent that specializes in health and Medicare insurance. In my free time, I offer free education and resources about how to navigate health insurance. I am an insurance agent because I saw first-hand how my family struggled to get and understand affordable medical treatment. It was the fear of the cost that hindered us from being the healthiest we could be. Moving forward, I will continue educating people, including my patients, about different insurance options tailored to their needs. Insurance is an everchanging terrain, and I hope to make navigating insurances easier for my future patients.",,,1,"In March 2020, I was in the midst of my informal post-baccalaureate program. It was a struggle to transition from in-person classes to virtual ones. However, I took the opportunity to connect with my peers and professors virtually and we helped each other stay uplifted. Since my volunteer clinic was closed, I founded a philanthropic group called The Givemas Project and continued to provide for the underserved. I wanted to still make a difference despite the unprecedented circumstances. During this time, I also started studying for the MCAT because I was fortunate to receive an MCAT scholarship. But I delayed my test because it was difficult to keep up with all the last-minute cancellations. I also wasn‚Äôt able to visit my family, who lived two hours away. They work as caregivers in an elderly care home, and most of the residents are vulnerable to COVID-19. I signed up for virtual shadowing through online platforms so I could learn more about the clinical world and stay involved in it.",1,1,2

I do believe my journey to medicine began with one of these moments. At 13 years old, my uncle's suicide left me questioning a lot. My parents and I had always been very open when it came to my mental health and I never felt it was something to be whispered about behind closed doors. When my uncle’s alcoholism and mental state was brought into question, it ensued an eruption of emotions from my grandmother followed by her immediate exit from the room. I was beginning to understand the detrimental effects stigma surrounding mental health had in my family. I noticed the lack in access to mental health resources my cousins living in rural Arkansas had. I wondered why therapy for my cousins, grieving the death of their father, was too expensive or too far away and why counseling through the school did not offer adequate hours for my working aunt. The long-term effects of such unequal access to mental health resources – had costly effects. From school expulsions to arrests, it seems that life for my cousins has been an endless cycle rooted in inequality. This was my first lesson in what I would soon learn to be social determinants of health. 

Shortly thereafter, the pressures of high school guidance counselors and college visits prompted me to seriously consider my future career goals. Being one of the few POC at my high school during polarizing political elections aided in this process. When Obamacare and “socialized medicine” were being debated, I was stunned by the complexity and controversy associated with healthcare in our country and knew it was a sector I wanted to learn more about. I also quickly learned individual biases my peers held towards immigrants like my mother and minorities like myself. When a peer approached me in the hallway and told me to “go back where I came from” I had never felt so helpless and ashamed of who I was. It was a feeling I swore I would never let anyone feel and made me realize I wanted a career where I could be a voice for people who felt they did not belong. 

I entered Northeastern with the hope of one day working in Public Health, uplifting the voices of people falling through our system’s cracks. I chose Health Sciences as a major because it seemed like the perfect mix of science--which I already enjoyed--and public health, my newfound interest. Studying healthcare systems abroad, I learned how differently medicine was provided on a structural level and observed the central role physicians played across every system of health. I learned when conducting public health research, there is only so much a role in public health could allow due to community-level and structural goals of change, but I found fulfillment in working with minority, low-income populations.

My clinical co-op taught me how much I enjoy the intimacy of patient care and interpersonal interaction, something that was missing from my public health experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic could have halted this experience, however, it ended up serving as a defining period of growth and the final deciding factor in my pursuit of a career in medicine. My fellow co-ops all elected to return home, leaving me as the only student co-op in the hospital. The idea of returning home was tempting with my family being over 1400 miles away and the risk of infection given my commute and work, however, I knew it was a decision I could have never made. The hospital was already facing staff shortages and it was a time healthcare workers were needed most. During this time, I was the only person patients would see with some doctors electing virtual appointments and the hospital enforcing a strict, but necessary, no visitor policy. I felt a sense of obligation to assuage patients fears as best I could and help patients who rely on interpreters or family members to attend their visits. Whether it was printing out directions for a patient to get home or color coding patients individual medication lists, I did anything I could to make their days easier to get through. It helped to speak with patients and hear their different stories, but I felt a familiar feeling of helplessness watching patients receive disappointing prognoses alone or listening to patients speak about family members they had lost. The best comfort I could offer was the simplicity of listening and sharing my own similar experiences as a relief. 

I watched as physicians were able to put patients’ worries to ease with their own expertise and experiences. I realized how physicians were put in a position where they not only support patients who are in their most helpless state, but can offer treatment and solutions. This grave responsibility and unspoken duty physicians have to advocate for their patients was what I had been searching for in a profession and what drives my call to pursue medicine. Though I find purpose in medicine, I know I will be a great physician because I have found my passion in people.","I never felt fully accepted by my‚Äô Arkansan family and the political discourse that occurred over the past 8 years only exacerbated our differences. Attending college in Boston but coming ‚Äúhome‚Äù to Arkansas has given me a unique perspective and the space to process my family‚Äô situation in a new light. I‚Äôve realized how vulnerable rural communities are and the effects their abandonment in policy, education and healthcare has had on my family. I realize they, along with many rural communities, reject ideas of ‚Äúprogression‚Äù and technology because of the negative impact manufacturing had on the agricultural industry and farms in their region. I no longer harbor any resentment towards my family, but  instead want to advocate for them and rural communities as a whole in my future medical career. I think we all bring a particular lens to the world and I have learned that being able to understand others' experiences through their own lens is how we foster honest, human connection and change.","My experience as a DREAM mentor gave me the opportunity to grow alongside my mentee Jojo for four years. I was 19 and Jojo was 11 when we first met. We were both navigating a new school year, I was beginning my sophomore year and Jojo had just started middle school‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to believe I‚Äôve now seen her through her first year of high school. Jojo was the oldest kid in the program and with her previous mentor graduating, she was certain it would be her last year attending DREAM with her baby cousins. From making pancakes in my first apartment to conquering Jojo's fear of ice skating, I made sure our time in DREAM was anything but boring. Talking Jojo through her first breakup and, later on this year, being one of the first people she came out to made me proud of the friendship we have built. We have both grown into people our younger selves would be proud of and we have fostered a relationship that will remain past either of our ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù statuses in DREAM. _x000D_
",,,1,"While many saw the COVID-19 pandemic as an obstacle, I saw it as a pivotal learning experience in my journey to medicine. Opting to stay in Boston and work throughout the Spring of 2020, instilled an unwavering feeling of confidence and trust in myself. The responsibilities that come with being a physician can be a heavy burden to bear and individual choices affect the care one provides. I have proven to myself that even in unprecedented times, I‚Äôm willing and able to make the right call- not for myself, but for others. Working full-time with no family or friends a close geographic proximity, was not an easy feat. Like many others, I struggled mentally and emotionally. I was just twenty years old and very scared at the ambiguity of what the future held and when I‚Äôd be able to see my family next.

As I made my way to the next room, I bumped into the oncologist, who notified me that the patient had just received difficult news: Her cancer had metastasized. I entered the room and immediately noticed the patient’s facial expressions were overwhelmingly somber as she grappled with her dismal prognosis. She asked me to sit with her and, to my surprise, reached out for me to hold her hand. As she began to weep, I realized that being a physician required much more than providing patients with a diagnosis and treatment plan. Volunteering in oncology showed me that physicians hold an inherent duty to not only heal the body, but also the human spirit. Working alongside oncologists, I saw how doctors can forge meaningful and trusting relationships that empower them to support and comfort patients facing emotional hardships. I am inspired by physicians’ dedication to constantly adapt and be keenly aware of each patient’s disposition. In turn, I learned how this awareness also allows physicians to assist patients in different facets of their life that cannot be measured by medical devices. This powerful realization shifted my understanding of what it means to heal, motivating me to pursue a career in medicine and to one day support patients in body, mind and soul.

Throughout my clinical experiences, I have seen how physicians can form stronger relationships with their patients when they are able to break through barriers. As an undergraduate student, I volunteered at Riverside Methodist Hospital, where I was eager to learn and use American Sign Language (ASL) to better connect with deaf patients. During one of my shifts, I noticed the nursing staff hastily searching for an interpreter to aid in discharging a deaf patient, Phoebe. I assured the nurses that communication would not be a problem and headed to Phoebe's room. When I introduced myself in ASL, her eyes widened and lit up as she signed back, “I can’t believe you can chat with me!” Conversing with Phoebe illustrated to me how daunting accessing healthcare is for individuals facing various obstacles to their care, such as language barriers, mental disabilities or financial constraints. I came to understand that when physicians and healthcare teams take steps to minimize these hindrances to care, they enhance their ability to truly care for each patients’ individual needs. In cultivating a sincere human connection with Phoebe, my contributions allowed her to feel better supported and ensured she had a positive healthcare experience. Being there for patients like Phoebe taught me to better empathize with patients and how to identify individual circumstances which may impact their ability to receive care and manage medical problems.

After graduating, I moved back home to Illinois, enthused to explore the challenges confronting urban communities and to further grasp how impediments to healthcare affect health outcomes. To this end, I began volunteering with Old Irving Park Community Clinic, which serves the uninsured. When the clinic faced a large patient volume and a shortage of staff, I was quickly trained on how to administer retinal exams, take blood pressures and place leads for EKGs. While taking a patient’s vitals, I was shocked to hear this was the first time he had seen a healthcare provider in six years. He explained that losing his insurance caused an extensive lapse in his medical care, ultimately preventing proper management of his chronic hypertension and diabetes. Assisting the day-to-day operations of the clinic, I saw how physicians can fill the void caused by these systemic factors, such as lack of insurance coverage, that contribute to patients feeling isolated in navigating their medical concerns. Doctors at the clinic taught me the virtue of collaborating with community initiatives to mitigate deficiencies in healthcare access and improving the health of both the individual and community at large. I was moved that this work was capable of changing the health trajectory for many patients, an impact that inspires me to specifically serve and support these populations in my future medical practice.

From ice-water volunteering to serving the uninsured, I have come to appreciate the evolving nature of practicing medicine to best accommodate patients’ unique healthcare situations. My experiences have proven to me the value of constructing strong relationships with patients, the importance of which is only amplified for individuals facing barriers in their care. Throughout my journey to medicine, I have witnessed firsthand the shortcomings of healthcare access for disadvantaged populations. Working alongside healthcare providers and mentors who selflessly address the needs of the community, I am motivated to face this challenge and provide care for those who need it most by joining the next generation of physicians. Moments of vulnerability shared with cancer patients and laughing with deaf patients have prepared me to serve with an open heart and mind. I am impassioned to uphold this ethos in my medical training and practice.","I had the privilege of being accepted to the Global Leadership Initiative (GLI) at Ohio State, an organization of student leaders from domestic and international backgrounds. In GLI, we designed community outreach projects to assist underserved populations in Columbus. Since my project group was composed of students from diverse backgrounds, cultural exchange was important for us to learn to work as a team. Discussing our favorite foods, art and the differences between Asia, Europe and the United States, we came to better understand and appreciate one another. Interacting with students from backgrounds different than my own, I came to realize that our shared values connected us more than our individual differences. GLI helped broaden my worldview and has shown me that genuine collaboration is possible when people from various backgrounds respect their shared experiences. Working with peers from different walks of life has built my confidence in communicating and connecting with others.","Early on in my undergraduate career, I became aware of the large presence of sexual assault and abuse on campus. I joined a student organization, The Unmasked Movement, to bring awareness to the different facets of sexual violence and its increasing prevalence within the lives of my campus community. My work with victims of sexual abuse has opened my eyes to how individuals from different cultures experience and cope with sexual violence and trauma in varying ways. As a result, I have grown in my ability to effectively communicate with individuals facing difficult situations. Seeing how individuals are able to rebuild their confidence and exert greater control over their lives, I have found tremendous fulfillment in supporting others. Having seen the positive outcomes which are possible when disadvantaged individuals are provided with resources that meet their specific needs, I am motivated to continue engaging in social justice work alongside my medical training.",,,1,"When my university shifted to online learning at the onset of the pandemic, I moved home and I forfeited the healthcare volunteering positions which were vital to my preparation for medical school.

Living at home in a medically-underserved area, I was eager to help address the needs of those negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I began volunteering at Old Irving Park Community Clinic (OIPCC) to help support the uninsured populations of Chicago. OIPCC‚Äôs patients harbored distrust in healthcare systems and were hesitant to receive vaccinations against COVID-19.

The room was meticulously organized; tools rested on sterile trays, nearly every surface was engulfed in blue, and the operating table bathed under hanging lights. Once inside, my heartbeat quickened as I looked at the drapes, knowing beneath them lay a patient from my Prosthetics and Orthotics clinical rotation. A transtibial amputation was about to unfold before my eyes. The surgeon called for his scalpel, and the following moments unveiled my purpose: to become a physician. In the OR, I discovered a career that years of my life had been leading me to.

My journey to medicine began on a late summer morning in 2007. My mother and I frantically left our house for the local hospital where my father had been admitted the previous night for chest pain. His condition worsened, and when we arrived at his room, the curtain was drawn, but I could see my father’s feet, stiff at the edge of the bed. Unbeknownst to us, my father’s cancer had returned after years of remission. The tumor in his pericardium stopped his heart. 

My life forever changed at just 13 years old. At an age where a boy looks to his father for direction, mine was taken away in a heartbeat. I yearned to understand how a mass that was so small could affect my family in such a large way. In my free time outside of sports and school, I found myself curled up at my family’s computer, learning about the inner workings of organ systems. I was fascinated by life’s fragility and the human body’s complexity.

After the devastating loss of my father, I began volunteering at City of Hope. I spent my school nights with patients receiving chemotherapy. Sometimes we played cards, while other times, I held their hands and listened to their stories. I saw my father’s reflection in these patients facing the same life-threatening illness. I watched the patients’ care teams quietly and efficiently move around the bulky recliners, adjusting IVs and trying to make each patient feel comfortable despite the heaviness of the room. I contemplated what greater impact I could have in the lives of others when they are most vulnerable.

A few years later, my mother shattered several of her lumbar vertebrae. Her treatment exposed me to the field of Prosthetics and Orthotics (P & O), and I pursued my Master’s in this field, believing that P & O would fulfill my desire to use healthcare as a means to affect the lives of others in a significant way. I thought I had found my calling, but I knew something was missing when I observed that transtibial amputation during my P & O rotation. Witnessing the surgeon cut, cauterize, resect, and sew was an awe-inspiring form of art that left me breathless as the surgeon led the team in their common goal for the patient. In a small way, watching the surgeon work with tools reminded me of precious moments spent with my father, a skilled craftsman who taught me how to use tools to breathe new life into something. This surgery opened my eyes to the breadth of procedural possibilities that are exclusive to a physician. At that moment, I realized what had been missing in my career choice.

I became fixated on medicine and soaked up every exposure to this field presented during my Master’s. On the first day of my cadaver lab elective, I brimmed with anticipation as I held the forceps in my shaking hands, ready to learn more about the structures I saw in surgery. I felt like that 13-year-old boy again, fascinated by the human body, and I daydreamed about a life where I could directly impact these systems as a physician. My curiosity pushed me to ask questions beyond the scope of P & O. I sought answers by attending conferences and symposiums, and reached out to the physicians who participated. After graduation, I shadowed several specialists to gain insight into the daily realities of being a physician. The ability to diagnose patients and use numerous medical modalities was riveting and solidified my choice of medicine. 

Today, I am a clinical assistant and watch our physicians effectively diagnose and treat hundreds of patients. One patient, “Max,” had spent years searching for answers regarding his debilitating back pain. A physician in our office diagnosed his condition and provided treatment for more than a year. Each time we saw Max, he thanked our physician for improving his quality of life. In encounters like this, I am reminded that humanity is one of the most beautiful aspects of medicine; to recognize someone’s suffering and do everything within your power to help them overcome it. While I am proud to support patients as a clinical assistant, I continually aspire to wear and walk in the shoes of a physician, utilizing a wealth of knowledge and expertise to give patients hope. I feel closer than ever to the life I have been dreaming of.

While my journey toward medicine was untraditional, I have confirmed that being a physician is my true calling. As I look toward my future, I believe medicine is the only path for me. I have found not only my passion, but also my purpose.","Working with individuals that have mental and physical disabilities through Outdoors For All is one experience that has broadened my worldview. Throughout my time volunteering with this organization, I have seen how individuals with disabilities are traditionally excluded from everyday activities, including outdoor recreation. It has been rewarding to bond with participants over our love of the outdoors. I relish seeing the joy on participants' faces as we spend the day on the mountain together._x000D_
_x000D_
This experience has given me a greater perspective on my life, helped me better understand the differences of others in my community, and taught me how to address individuals with disabilities without stigma. This experience has also taught me the importance of prioritizing inclusion and embracing the uniqueness of those around us. I want to continue participating in programs supporting this population as a medical student and physician.","Throughout my life, I have had several experiences where I was able to impact communities in need by working to mitigate determinants of health. I traveled to Mexico to help deliver orthotic care to over 100 underserved children with disabilities to increase their activity and participation. During my Master‚Äôs, my classmates and I created adaptive exercise clinics for individuals with physical disabilities to learn workout techniques and increase their activity. Currently, I volunteer with Outdoors For All to help youth with physical and mental disabilities enjoy outdoor sports. I also work with Solid Ground to help provide produce to impoverished communities and those in food deserts. These various experiences have been rewarding and shown me tangible ways I can positively impact the lives of those in my community. I look forward to serving those living in Chicago‚Äôs west side and learning strategies to mitigate the determinants of health for these neighborhoods.",,,1,"I had a job as a personal trainer in March 2020 and the inability to work for several months significantly impacted the savings I hoped to have for my medical school applications and education. At the time, I was also shadowing several physicians to gain insight into medicine, which I could not do after the pandemic began. My connections with these physicians resulted in me accepting a position as a clinical assistant at a physiatry practice in August 2020. Working in this position has given me a deeper understanding of medicine and reaffirmed my desire to become a physician. While this was a stressful period, it taught me how to be resourceful and patient.",1,0,1

In spite of all she was facing, her eyes lit up as she shared the events of her son’s baseball game the night before. Of all the lessons from my volunteering in the St. Barnabas Oncology Wing during high school, the way patients' faces brightened when they spoke about their families remains etched in my memory. The experience of working with patients at their most vulnerable time, as well as learning about the etiology and treatment of various forms of cancer, formed an important foundation for me on my path to medicine.
In college, I continued to explore the medical field by working at the Miller Research Lab, which studies neurodegenerative diseases. I assisted in a project centered on reversing harmful tau isoform ratios in astrocytes, a common phenomenon in illnesses like CTE and dementia. The goal of this research was to develop approaches for new therapeutics for these conditions. Being part of a team focused on this cutting-edge research that will directly impact so many individuals held personal significance because of my own concussion and 11-month recovery. Through this work, I grew in my understanding of astrocyte function and its role in maintaining normal brain function, learning how traumatic injuries like concussions can create degenerative protein ratios as well as the hopeful prospects for treatments in the future. As our research successfully yielded a new path for therapeutics, I saw how developing new treatment approaches could change patient protocols and improve medical care. This observation led to my realization that I wanted to spend my career at the forefront of these medical advances, applying them in a clinical setting.
I entered that clinical environment when I joined Total Access Urgent Care (TAUC) as a scribe and technician. In these roles, I have worked with patients of various backgrounds, from underprivileged communities of inner St. Louis to rural towns far west of the city. In one of our downtown clinics, a new patient presented with extreme thirst, confusion, and severe, diffuse abdominal pain. As I palpated for a vein hiding deep in her arm, I asked if she was okay. As our eyes met, she weepingly opened up about her mother’s passing a few weeks prior and how she was drowning in stress and grief. Most relevant to her eventual diagnosis, though, was a fleeting reference to a condition she had not indicated on her intake forms: diabetes. With the IV in place, I asked to smell her breath, testing a theory I formed from that revelation. Struck by the fruity smell of ketones and guided by both the memories of organic chemistry as well as my understanding of diabetes, the picture started to come into focus. I shared this information with Dr. Hayden, hoping the patient’s diabetes and fruity breath would help solve the mystery of her condition. 
I saw the gears churning in Dr. Hayden’s head as she considered the patient’s presentation with this new information before conducting her exam. Scribing this interaction, I was struck by how Dr. Hayden compassionately placed a hand on the patient’s arm, questioning her further to better understand the patient’s medical history and the events preceding the onset of her symptoms. Dr. Hayden, with the lab results in hand, concluded that through a combination of stress and forgetting to take her medications, the patient entered diabetic ketoacidosis. As she shared these findings with the patient, explaining the treatment plan to rehydrate and rebalance her electrolytes with IV fluids, it was evident that Dr. Hayden reached this diagnosis not only through the clinical presentation and lab work but also through the patient’s personal story. Through this experience, I saw firsthand the impact of a physician’s combining of clues from the patient with medical and clinical training to solve problems and provide quality medical care. 
My experiences supporting patients with cancer, participating in cutting-edge research, and serving at various clinics have both reaffirmed my commitment to medicine and provided me with a deeper understanding of the field. As someone who enjoys solving puzzles, I have come to realize that listening to the patient’s story and taking their circumstances into consideration are the framework for quality medical care. Only when the borders are laid out through the patient's history can doctors best deploy advancements in science and complete the full picture of the patient’s condition. My path to medicine has shown me the importance and complexity of a physician's job in drawing on all the tools available, not only science and experience but also compassion and understanding, to achieve an accurate diagnosis and treatment for a patient. This perspective has become the foundation of my commitment to medicine and will continue to shape my path forward.","By the time we spoke about his depression, my brother had grown increasingly short-tempered and expressed feelings of inadequacy. Whether through game nights or dinners, our family life had become stressful as TJ‚Äôs behavior changed. Speaking openly, TJ shared the challenges in his life and how his outlook on the world always seemed negatively tainted, a viewpoint that was foreign to me. In return, I shared how I had sought therapy in high school to empower myself against my anxiety and encouraged TJ to do the same._x000D_
His choice to seek treatment after our talk was a major step for him and our family, demonstrating the impact of supporting someone during personal turmoil. Supporting TJ in his struggles with mental health has shown me that even when I do not completely grasp one‚Äôs point of view, I should always be respectful of their perspective. Being cognizant of these differences and empowering others to advocate for themselves have become the cornerstones of how I view diversity.","Starting my clinical experiences at Total Access Urgent Care (TAUC) in the middle of the pandemic, I gained an understanding of the social problems affecting access to healthcare for many patients. I distinctly recall the fear in one uninsured COVID patient‚Äôs voice as she relayed how she could not afford the medications for her diabetes or hypertension since the closure of her low-income neighborhood clinic, essentially cutting off her lifeline. She could only afford a visit to TAUC due to the CARES Act, which was unsustainable to manage these chronic conditions. Recognizing how the patient was being forced to leverage her financial well-being against her health, I reached out to other community clinics in hopes of securing her access to affordable long-term care. With the referral in hand, the patient left TAUC not only with a better understanding of how to manage her COVID symptoms but also with the means to take back her agency over her health.",,,1,"I began my undergraduate career planning to graduate a semester early. After experiencing a full semester of virtual learning and upon being notified that my study abroad program had been canceled, I instead pivoted to take a leave of absence in the spring of my junior year.

My heart is racing, and my stomach is turning. The trauma room was stale and cold, yet I worked up a sweat. My only priority was to manually keep her heart beating. With every chest compression, she thuds against the bed from the weight of my hands. Her skin becomes bright red from the friction. The nurse across from me analyzes my depth and rate of compressions. She begins to rectify my declining performance. I'm becoming increasingly tired and frustrated with myself, but I maintain my diligent efforts through her instruction. After the final ""clear"" was exclaimed, the nurse felt a pulse. At this exact moment, I was overwhelmed to witness the impact I could have on another person's life. This relief was temporary as the patient coded again after being transported to the ICU. The physician called the time of death. Walking through those emergency room doors, I never expected to be immediately thrown into such a critical situation during my EMT clinical rotation. I was captivated by the diverse range of emotions, compassion for others, and collaboration with my peers that this field provided. Although this was a routine heart attack for the staff, this experience significantly impacted my career ambitions, becoming the turning point in my dedication to medicine.
My introduction to medicine began as a child with severe asthma and numerous respiratory allergies. I frequently endured extreme exertion on my lungs as my bronchioles constricted. The lack of adequate oxygen would slowly cause me to panic, making me feel as if my life was fleeting. Praying to God, frightened that it may be my last day to spend with my family, we rushed to the hospital for steroids and albuterol treatments. These trips developed into a persistent routine until my asthma became manageable. At such an impressionable young age, physicians became my role models. Although my family deeply cared about my well-being, I saw doctors as my only hope to breathe again. Through their kind-hearted actions, I watched how they could turn my worst days into something tolerable. Being under their care helped me recognize the importance of this relationship and bolstered my desire to provide this for future patients, which ultimately led me to become an EMT.
Next, I found myself posted in an ambulance on the streets of Chicago. My partner and I got a call to transport a patient from the psych unit. The page contained the location, patient identifiers, and permission to use restraints if needed. Arriving at the hospital, nervous about what is to come, we approached the nurse's station. I noticed that security is nearby, but I'm hopeful this was unrelated to the situation. The nurse reiterated potential restraints. As my partner gathers paperwork, I cautiously approached the dimly lit room. The patient was lying in bed, silent upon my entry. The tension escalated until the moment we started conversing. From all the information leading up to this point, I expected him to be a violent, combative patient; however, there was no indication of such. The man I saw had only experienced a rough day. My partner walked in with the stretcher, restraints in hand, and two security guards. Shaking my head, no, we step out of the room. We left without restraints, explaining that I am comfortable being alone with the patient on our trip and do not want to exacerbate the circumstances. He was already there against his will, and I did not want to restrict him further. My partner trusted my plea. In the end, my patient and I had a mutually positive experience. I was confident that showing compassion was more effective than showing unnecessary alarm. Having this autonomy in choices and open communication with my partner, I treated the patient how they presented to me and not how others perceived them.
Wanting to pursue hands-on, procedural-based work, I eventually became a phlebotomist. One early morning, a mother came in with her four-year-old son. He was visibly pale, terrified, and gripping tightly onto his brown, stuffed bear. As they approached, the boy sprinted to the corner with his face towards the wall. After they had a brief bout, she decided to bring him back another day. Recognizing the patient was in an unfamiliar situation, I picked up his stuffed animal from the ground, got down to his level, and explained it to him. I asked if I could glance at his arms with my tourniquet. As he slowly got comfortable with me, I demonstrated what a vein was by having him feel its ""bounce."" Silently signaling to his mother to have a seat back in my phlebotomy chair, he abruptly followed. Within a minute, the procedure was done, the tests were drawn, and they were both pleased. I recalled the faith I had in my physicians as a kid, who eased the panic of my asthma attacks and wanted to do the same for this boy.
My passion for medicine is uniformly tied to my drive to help and serve others: dedicated to improving each of my patients’ lives. Medical school will give me the necessary knowledge and skills to achieve this goal. The moment I helped save another human being with my medical training solidified my pursuit of becoming a physician.","While volunteering at Community Health, a non-profit organization located in West Town, Chicago, I worked closely with the Latinx and Polish communities. This clinic provided care to patients that had limited to no access to healthcare insurance due to their income or documentation status. Although they offered this service, it was severely limited: not offering surgical intervention and relying on volunteer medical students and physicians. On numerous occasions, I had to put myself into the perspective of my patients when it came to concerns about vaccinations. Over time, I could understand why they were reluctant, as many of them were undocumented citizens and mistrusted the government. Many of my attempts to reduce this hesitancy were futile and initially frustrated me. As I was vaccinated, my beliefs shifted from seeing this issue as an obstacle that I needed to rectify to respecting the patient‚Äôs autonomy in their choices and adapting to their concerns.","Becoming an Eagle Scout required a vast amount of community service to obtain: the greatest being a project entirely crafted by myself. This roughly 300-hour time commitment consisted of gathering donations and volunteers to paint curbs bright yellow throughout Schaumburg‚Äôs Public Works Department. Due to the previous lack of visibility at night, injuries and accidents frequently occurred. Although this may seem simple on paper, this project propelled me into a leadership role of over 25 individuals, dictating everyone‚Äôs responsibilities and retaining their focus on the end goal. Once we completed the monumental task at hand, I received periodic updates from the supervisors on the increased visibility. This project was completed seven years ago, but the effects can still be seen today. I am grateful for the opportunity to create such an impactful difference in the safety of my local government employees and for the experience it provided me through leading my peers.",,,1,"At the start of the pandemic, I lived in the UIC dorms. After classes began to switch from in-person to online, they offered me a partial refund to move out. I decided to move back in with my parents because most in-person activities, such as the gym, research, and classes, were shut down. Now living over 50 miles away from Chicago in a rural community, the abrupt lifestyle change created numerous stressors. While transporting COVID-19 patients as an EMT, I contracted the virus and infected my family in April 2020. With the little public information, my family was terrified. My sister had just had her first baby and would not let us visit her if I continued to work there. With this complication and two-hour commute to the city, I left this employment.

Despite the recurrent blows to my morale, I continued to run year after year until, finally, I was elected my senior year. Holding that leadership position was important to me because I knew that I could be the problem solver my peers needed. They asked for non-uniform sweatshirts on Fridays, tampons in the restrooms, and I even remember promising my middle school peers soda at lunch. No matter how trivial the request, I wanted to provide for them. Even then I wanted to be the person that used my skills to benefit others.
This desire followed me to Cornell where I trained on their gymnastics team. There, I experienced a major shift in mindset about my sport. Instead of focusing on my own success, I was driven to help those around me to improve. I supported my teammates through the many challenges that came with being a gymnast; I gave advice about balancing the demands of school and gym, offered guidance regarding overcoming mental blocks, and simply listened when they needed to vent about the pressure of being a collegiate athlete. After being voted captain my senior year, I was eager to bring new ideas to the table, striving to help everyone work together for our collective success. As I watched my teammates reach their goals, I was once again reminded of the satisfaction that comes when helping others.
This same desire to provide leadership and support to others is what drives me to pursue a career in medicine. Being a physician would give me the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience for the benefit of others. During school breaks, I worked as a medical assistant at an OBGYN clinic. My work duties gave me clinical knowledge and showed me firsthand the impact that a doctor can have on people. I appreciated getting to interact personally with the patients, experience how the clinic runs, and see how even a routine gynecological exam can give peace of mind. I witnessed everything from young adults consulting on birth control to the joy of new mothers listening to their baby’s first heartbeat. To practice medicine, combining scientific knowledge with true compassion for others, would be a rare privilege and an honor I hope to experience. 
As an athlete in a physically demanding sport, I relate personally to the patient’s perspective of healthcare. Although gymnastics was tough on my body, sometimes leading to injury, the experience gave me an appreciation for the doctors who treated me. I was treated by doctors who used knowledge and experience to accurately diagnose my problems and recommend an effective plan of care leaving me reassured. Unfortunately, I have seen this special knowledge and experience used for both good and evil, as seen in the case of Dr. Larry Nassar in 2017. Larry Nassar was the USA Gymnastics team doctor for 20 years. Five years ago, he was exposed for sexually abusing gymnasts on the national team. He assaulted at least 265 young girls that came to him for help. This deeply affected me. Gymnastics was my sport. I understood the sense of vulnerability and the call to obedience that this sport demands. The way that this doctor took advantage of these young women disgusted me. I asked myself, “How could someone in a profession that requires compassion and care cause so much destruction and horror?” When this came out, it made me question the practice of medicine. I believed that doctors were fundamentally good, and that those who chose to pursue the profession did so because of their drive to help people. I have come to understand the responsibility that falls on the shoulders of physicians—a responsibility that unfortunately not everyone respects. Reflecting on this made me realize that the only thing I can do is uphold my own beliefs. I can listen patiently, assist responsibly, and care passionately for those in need. 
My mother has been a model in my life for the qualities I will emulate as a future physician. While working as a medical assistant, I have seen my mother at work as an OBGYN. She sees as many as 40 patients per day and she makes an effort to know details from each of their lives. As she listens with compassion to her patients, she gives them a voice and a safe space to open up. She provides support and encouragement as she treats each one with a personal touch. By striving to adopt her curious, caring, and empathetic qualities into my own life today, I am building a strong foundation for my future as a medical professional. 
In many ways, I am pursuing medicine for the same reason I wouldn’t give up as the 8th grader who wanted to be a leader and find ways to help her friends. As a student athlete, I have worked to develop a strong knowledge base aided by my grit and determination. At the same time, I strive to maintain high levels of compassion fueled by my desire to help others and make a difference in their lives. I have seen what a privilege it is to care for others and I know my experiences have prepared me to pursue the most fulfilling career I could imagine, being a physician.","When a new genetics specialist joined our team I was excited to get to know him. Alejandro previously lived in Mexico and France, and told me this was his first time in the United States. I toured him around the medical center, explained our public transportation, and recommended some good restaurants that served authentic Mexican cuisine. After two weeks, Alejandro asked me to explain the U.S. tax system. I thought it was out of the blue, but then realized he probably received his first paycheck and had questions about filing it. At this moment I understood how difficult it must be to move to a new country. I explained what I knew about our tax system, and gave him additional resources to help._x000D_
After speaking with Alejandro, I better understood the cultural shock he was experiencing. Becoming more aware of cultural differences people face and how easily they could feel excluded or misunderstood, I feel compelled to make others feel welcomed and accepted regardless of their background.","‚ÄúI get to choose?‚Äù Josh asks in disbelief as I offer him a Coke or Sprite. Josh is living on the streets of Houston and comes to the Emergency Aid Coalition daily to pick up his sack lunch.

However, on this day I not only got to include a cold soda, but I was also able to give people like Josh a choice in what they wanted. Josh‚Äôs surprise to my question made me realize he doesn't usually get this opportunity. _x000D_
While at the EAC I formed relationships with other people in this community and learned specific things they needed or wanted.

To bridge this gap, I planned COVID safe activities like scavenger hunts and sought out outdoor volunteering opportunities. Connecting with the local YMCA, I planned events for us clearing and building up their wilderness trails. While this was nowhere near the amount of service we had done in the past, I was grateful for the chance to give back to my community. _x000D_

I looked back down at her mother, our patient, and readjusted my palms toward the center of her chest, while I continued firm and fast compressions. The crying and chaos were tuned out. I was focused. After several rounds of CPR, a pulse was detected, and our team lifted the patient off the kitchen floor and transported her from her secluded desert home to the closest hospital. Although the ambulance sped up, the sirens rang louder, and the prognosis grew dimmer, I held my own steady pace when operating the bag-valve mask. Out of the darkness, two headlights approached, inching ever closer to our rear bumper. We raced through dark, sandy roads, and once in the city, ran red lights and stop signs. Dangerously, the two headlights still followed behind us. I knew exactly who it was.

Moments after arrival at the ER, the elderly woman we treated was pronounced dead. For the first time, I lost a patient. I heard our paramedic reprimanding the patient’s daughter, “Never follow an ambulance so closely!” The daughter cried and ran outside with her young son clinging to her leg. I was in Israel volunteering as an EMT with Magen David Adom, Israel’s national ambulance. I was surrounded by strangers, hospital employees, and patients, who were all conversing in a language in which I had only basic proficiency. I followed my instincts and walked outside to our patient's daughter.

I faced her scared, sad eyes once again.

In Hebrew, I expressed my condolences. She corrected my grammatical errors, and asked me where I was from as she wiped away her tears and smiled. We spoke briefly, and she thanked me for traveling to Israel to volunteer. As we drove to headquarters, my partner told me he appreciated that I made sure our patient’s daughter was okay. He told me we were a good team and said I could work with him anytime. This was particularly meaningful as many paramedics did not have confidence in foreign volunteer technicians. For the remainder of the summer, he and I partnered together for nearly every shift.

Days later, short staffed, I was alone in the back of an ambulance monitoring a woman in labor. Upon noticing her contractions were becoming closer together and longer in duration, I alerted the paramedic who was driving. The ambulance immediately accelerated causing my notepad to fall underneath the stretcher and out of reach. After that, I recorded her contraction times on my glove for our report to the ER doctors. Miles away from the closest hospital, our patient was alone, in pain, and becoming anxious. She regained composure when I led her through breathing exercises. It was a long drive from her village to the closest ER, but we made it safely. Once we arrived, the patient requested that my partner and I stay with her, where we witnessed pure joy and the safe delivery of her child. I expected her family and friends to come rushing into the hospital at any moment, but nobody came. For this patient, no headlights followed the ambulance. 

After much self reflection, my experiences with these two particular patients have given me insight. I have learned that we cannot simply ignore the headlights that follow behind our patients. Our responsibility is both to the patient who lies directly before us as well as to those who may follow closely behind. Further, when there are no headlights that follow, establishing rapport and trust can go a long way.

This insight has helped me in my current position at the Hospital for Special Surgery where I serve as the lead research assistant coordinating a double blind Phase II clinical trial which is under FDA oversight. Here, we are investigating the safety and efficacy of off-label use of abaloparatide (a PTH receptor agonist) in patients undergoing spine fusion operations. Due to COVID-19 there was a strict no visitor policy at HSS. This left many of our participants alone before and after their complex operations. While I meticulously recorded medical histories, drew blood, obtained research documentation, and instructed patients how to self-inject the study drug, I also connected with patients in these moments right before entering the OR and after waking in the PACU. When returning for follow-up visits, many participants expressed their appreciation for my support during these moments.

I have been determined never to lose sight of the patient’s experience, whether I directly or indirectly interact with them. During the pandemic, I investigated how COVID-19 affected vulnerable populations. For this, I was awarded a Tufts Research Grant. My research, conducted with a pediatric radiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, investigated the clinical and imaging experience with COVID-19 in unvaccinated children with cancer. While retrospectively analyzing large bodies of data to uncover pertinent patterns, I never forgot the patients and their families who lived beyond my computer screen. 

I plan to forge a career in medicine as it uniquely combines my passion for science with my natural ability for compassion.","The clinical trial I coordinate requires preoperative collection of several tubes of blood for diagnostic testing. During a recruitment conversation, a patient explained she was concerned about providing blood. Specifically, she was concerned that any additional preoperative blood loss would increase her risk of needing a blood transfusion, which as a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness, she could not accept. However, she also explained that she was eager to enroll in the trial as it might help her recovery._x000D_

I advocated for our patient by speaking with both her surgeon and my principal investigator about our patient‚Äôs concerns. The blood draw was deemed safe, and I relayed this information to our patient. Ultimately, the patient felt comfortable enrolling and was thankful that I understood her concerns and respected her religious beliefs. I learned firsthand how advocacy, understanding, and connection with patients of all backgrounds are essential pillars in providing the best clinical care.","Through my work as a research coordinator at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), I have experienced how healthcare providers can be catalysts of change for at-risk patients and communities._x000D_
_x000D_
I have been able to help several candidates participate in our clinical trial who otherwise might not have been able to enroll due to their social and/or financial situations. For example, at first, one patient explained to me that she would be unable to participate as she could not afford to take off the extra days from work and pay for transportation for the extra research follow-up visits. I worked with my team to arrange for transportation and scheduled meetings at different times from our usual schedule to accommodate the patient._x000D_

As the daughter of a domestic abuse counselor and a primary care physician who serves veterans, I grew up immersed in discussions about physical and mental healthcare issues. At 16, I was intrigued by dinner table conversations about the imploding need for greater access to preventive services and streamlined care for all. Especially motivated to find ways to reverse negative health trends attributed to the adoption of riskier behaviors and a lack of social support, I chose to study public health in college. At 21, the lessons I learned in class about enabling individual growth and building sustainable communities further spurred my passion to work at reducing disparate health outcomes as a physician myself one day. At 23, with direct patient care experience under my belt, my drive to become a doctor has been solidified.


While my upbringing coupled with my innate interests in biology and social sciences ignited my passion to pursue this path early on, many subsequent influences and experiences compel me to push through the long and challenging journey it takes to be a physician.


As an undergraduate eager to get involved, I volunteered with Universal Health Aid: Columbus, a grassroots organization dedicated to improving community health through education and preventive medicine. Elected to the executive board, I helped plan and run our annual health screening. This multi-week event grants medically underserved residents access to a diverse set of health care providers and public health resources free of charge. To me, the most meaningful part was assisting patients at the informational booths. By using simple terminology, hand gestures, and even basic Spanish to communicate effectively, I saw the empowered look on their faces when I linked them to the resources they needed. Because medical information can be ambiguous and difficult to process, I aspire to be a doctor who not only treats disease and illness but also facilitates patients’ efforts to manage their own health and well-being.


Upon graduation, I joined the National Health Corps to complete a public health service year. Assigned to Pittsburgh Mercy Family Health Center, a clinic that serves a large and diverse population, I have endless opportunities to learn from the highly skilled and dedicated team of providers as well as from the frequent and direct patient contact I have myself.


One evening while shadowing, a patient presented with an extremely infected forearm due to IV drug use. I assisted the family medicine doctor drain the abscess while engaging the patient in a discussion about his decision to wait days before seeking help. Visibly distraught, the patient admitted to feeling ashamed about his relapse and fearful of being discharged from his abstinence-based supportive housing. Using harm reduction principles and considering how the patient’s built environment impacted his well-being, the doctor strategized a treatment plan with him, relieved his anxiety, and earned his trust. As a result, this high-risk patient left the clinic healthier and agreed to return for a follow-up appointment. Inspired by this successful model, I too strive to practice holistic and patient-centered care.


As Pittsburgh Mercy is generally hectic, rushing from patient to patient ready to zip through the food insecurity screening is normal for me. One day, however, as I entered exam room 3, the apprehensive look on the young woman’s face stunned me. Seeing how nervous she was, I slowed down a bit and commented on the cute dog pictured on her phone case. She immediately began to feel more comfortable as she told me all about “Rudy.” Soon, intimate details about her unsafe and inadequate housing situation, financial struggles, and difficulty acquiring SNAP benefits came pouring out too. I listened without judgment and tried to maintain eye contact while finishing her intake. Having determined that she lived in a food insecure household, I explained how the health center’s food pantry works and arranged groceries for her to take home. As her initially shy smile grew wider, I saw the immeasurable value of my empathy, compassion, and patience and how they can change one’s entire demeanor. Encounters like this motivate me to provide a safe space for others to speak and to be heard, and to be a doctor who meets patients where they are.


Just as my decision to pursue medicine is catalyzed by a unique combination of influences, the physician I plan to be is the sum of who I am plus my experiences and deeply ingrained commitment to improving public health. Whether at the dinner table, volunteering at health fairs, or assisting patients in examination rooms, I have reaffirmed that becoming a doctor is the best path for me. The medical profession will allow me to deliver comprehensive care to individuals and communities while also working to promote health equity. For me, knowledge without action is not enough, which is “Why” I am confidently dedicating myself to building a career as a physician.","Since graduating from Ohio State, I have been serving with the National Health Corps (AmeriCorps) at a community health center in the heart of Pittsburgh. In this role, I have extensive interaction with patients who have low income, disabilities, are experiencing homelessness, and/or are severely mentally ill. Serving in this environment has shown me how complex and multifaceted health really is and that many patients have additional unexpressed needs on top of their presenting symptoms. As a result, I have learned to not make assumptions. Instead, I always ask questions to get a better understanding of the barriers people face in accessing care and try to think outside the box when serving patients with financial, transportation, housing, and other concerns. I have also learned that health care must be individualized, broad-minded, and aimed at treating the individuals who struggle to independently navigate the system.","Throughout college, I volunteered with a student organization called Universal Health Aid: Columbus. As an elected executive board member, I helped organize the annual free health screenings that brought primary care providers, mental health counselors, and local public health organizations to the medically underserved and under-resourced Hilltop neighborhood. As our main goal was to provide holistic care, we also distributed hygiene kits and collaborated with another student organization, Best Food Forward, to provide fresh meals to community members who attended our screenings._x000D_
 _x000D_
While there is still a tremendous amount of work left to be done, our sustained efforts in the Hilltop community increased access to essential health services and education. Additionally, by connecting individuals to the community resources and services they needed to live healthier lives, we ensured that they would continue to be cared for long after our screenings ended.",,,1,"When international travel bans prevented me from going to the Israel-Gaza Strip region to complete EMT training and learn about disaster relief efforts for my senior capstone project, I switched gears and found a position with the Ohio Domestic Violence Network (ODVN) instead. _x000D_

During my internship, I quickly grew to understand that domestic violence touches every corner of our society and that COVID-19 has only exacerbated the problems survivors face. As is the case with many competing health crises, vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected. _x000D_
_x000D_
Ultimately, COVID-19 and my time with ODVN furthered my passion to be a doctor. At a time when the need for quality health care is peaking, a career as a physician will allow me to provide care to survivors and vulnerable populations of all kinds on a much deeper level. I look forward to attending medical school with a trauma-informed lens and learning to treat the evolving clinical manifestations of coexisting health issues.",1,0,2

Sounding frustrated and weary, she explained she was hoping for relief from long COVID symptoms. She had exhausted all of her options and a member of her long COVID Facebook support group reported success with this procedure. For over a year, she had been experiencing bitter taste, a muted sense of smell, and heightened anxiety. Today, this burden seemed especially heavy. I reassured her we would do everything we could to help and made her an appointment for the nerve block.  As I listened to the patient share her story on the phone, I felt heartbroken because I could empathize with health struggles that infringe on everyday life.

Beginning my senior year of high school, I struggled with some residual symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). During this time, my aspirations to become a physician developed. AP Biology was fascinating; the intricacies of science enthralled me. I believed research-based medicine could truly help people. And yet, all doctors could ambiguously offer me was that EBV sometimes persists for unknown reasons. Similarly to my patient, I was discouraged. Did medicine actually have answers? I needed to reconcile medicine’s limitations with the power physicians wield as creative advocates on the cutting-edge of science. Not only did I need a provider to listen and validate my experiences, I wanted someone who would persevere and partner with me to pursue novel solutions to real conditions. I vowed to become exactly that.

I initially met this patient in person when she returned to our office for her second cervical nerve block. I enthusiastically inquired about the results of her first block, in hopes that she found relief. She excitedly reported how much it alleviated the symptoms that she had been experiencing since contracting COVID. She enjoyed food again and her anxiety and panic had lessened. She was thrilled, and so was I. The doctor discussed how cervical sympathetic nerve blocks usually treat chronic pain related to postherpetic neuralgia, however he was happy to try it. That day, I assisted the doctor in performing a fifteen minute procedure that drastically improved her quality of life.

The cervical nerve blocks helped this patient. Even if it had not been successful, I was committed to being there in support. Working as a medical assistant at a pain specialist this past year has given me many opportunities to interact directly with patients in chronic pain.  I heard countless patients express feelings of exasperation and isolation. The physician I work alongside often mentions a phrase he learned from his mentor: “If you listen to the patient long enough, they’ll tell you their diagnosis.” I would never presume to perfectly understand someone else’s struggle, but my own experiences gifted me a uniquely compassionate perspective.

The importance of improving medicine through research first became tangible to me after my immunology professor Dr. Martinez invited me to work in the COVID testing lab at Cal Poly. I helped develop the saliva-based testing program and transitioned all student testing from nasal swabs to saliva. We later progressed to a paper-based microfluidic analytical device that was more accurate and enabled us to detect positive results faster. We processed 4,000 tests together every day with the shared ownership of keeping our Cal Poly family safe. Medicine does not have all the answers, but my experiences showed me how forward progress positively impacts the health of real people in my community.

With a foundation of empathy for patients and a personal commitment to continuous learning, I realized another element is equally crucial in medicine. As a general biology and chemistry study session leader in college, I explained concepts to students and broke down scientific principles into manageable parcels. If I did not know the answer to something, I would find it. This was my first experience making science accessible and understandable. As I began working as a medical assistant, I realized how this valuable skill alleviates patients' worries. Every day, I observe a physician illustrate the principle of simplifying complicated procedures using models and diagrams. My position as a study session leader equipped students with knowledge and eased fears about exams; the role of a physician interprets scientific complexities and empowers patients to understand their health.

To borrow a compelling idea from one of my favorite memoirs, ""Between Two Kingdoms,"" my goal is to “find resonance in someone’s story without reducing [our] suffering to sameness.” My own health challenges clarified my major strengths. I am there to listen with patience, engage with grace, and help to the best of my ability. As others have done for me, I will listen compassionately with unique insight into the patient experience. I have learned through my mentors in medicine that I will not be able to perfectly fix all my patient’s problems. However, I vow to do my best and see patients as whole individuals. I am responsible for ensuring my patients feel heard, understood, and confident knowing I am committed to partner with them to meaningfully improve their lives.","In college, I volunteered in the emergency room of a local hospital. Initially an uncomfortable volunteer standing in the corner, I started to carve out moments of connection and engage in conversation. I learned that many patients came to the ER because they had no other option. I recognized an underserved population right in front of me in my own college town. The problems we saw were as diverse as the community we served: a grandparent who fell, an inmate at the local men‚Äôs prison, a person who was uninsured and unhoused. I listened to each story, resisting assumptions to provide compassionate care. The ER is a busy hub where people from every walk of life converge for a few hours to receive medical intervention. Physicians have the unique ability to meet people wherever they are today and partner with them to achieve a healthier future. Every week for three years, I learned how to respect everyone‚Äôs experiences and provide equitable care to all. ","Growing up in San Diego, I lived a mere 45 minutes from the US-Mexico border. Twice a year, my family partnered with a local organization in Tijuana to build two-room homes. By providing safe housing, the organization‚Äôs goal was to keep families together and give children better access to education. These moments of giving back to the community right across the border formed my childhood. As my family worked alongside families both similar and different from ours, I developed an acute awareness of my own privileges and instilled my belief that everyone inherently deserves safe housing and basic healthcare. Just as it always felt like a great privilege to build someone else a home, it is a great privilege to train to be a physician. I want to continue developing my medical Spanish skills and become a provider who makes care accessible. Physicians create justice by caring for marginalized populations in ways that are relevant and authentic to their communities. ",,,1,"Like many, I struggled with the isolation of online learning. Working in the COVID-19 testing lab at Cal Poly gave me a small community of people and provided much-needed connection. As we worked together to keep our community safe, I realized that focusing on helping others was the perfect antidote to the challenging loneliness of the pandemic. I had been preparing to apply last cycle, but realized I needed to care for my wellbeing in order to lay the groundwork for a holistic, whole-person approach to caring for my patients in the future. After graduating, I recognized my need to heal and rest and took the summer off to reconnect to others and myself. I processed the gravity of both the many lives we had lost and the time we lost with each other. I remembered one of my core reasons for pursuing medicine: it is about caring for people. Resilience is built in small moments and daily choices to reach outside myself and share both the burdens and joys of life with others.",1,1,2

I had just completed a four-mile run and was between breaths as I sucked down some much-needed water. I started taking ibuprofen after completing longer runs as an irritating dull ache would arise in my right hip and persist throughout my run and the following days. Today, like clockwork, the pain began after the halfway point, making it hard not to wince as I sat down to stretch. Reminding myself that relief was just 30 minutes away, I heard my mother, a pharmacist for over 20 years, advise me to take the tablets sparingly ""if I wanted to keep my kidneys."" 

I flashed back to my cross country running days as I read ""acute kidney injury"" and ""adverse effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs"" in Mrs. T's medical history. She sat on the small padded emergency department (ED) bed with three pillows propping her up, but still visibly uncomfortable, twisting and turning about. As Dr. W walked through the sliding glass door, she resigned herself to the discomfort and lifted her head to greet him, summoning as much enthusiasm as possible. Working as his medical scribe, I trailed in behind him and drew the curtain closed. With tears in her eyes, she explained how she endured the last six days without being dialyzed. My heart ached as she relayed her husband's recent passing, her soulmate and sole source of transportation. In addition to managing her acute discomfort and getting her admitted for dialysis, Dr. W spent significant time talking with Mrs. T about how to get to her future appointments. As Mrs. T was wheeled out of the ED, I noticed tears were still in her eyes as she looked at Dr. W, but this time it was with overflowing gratitude. 

This encounter taught me that having access to healthcare means more than just having a hospital nearby or insurance; having the ability to understand and utilize information can have significant effects in the care patients receive. I want to empower my patients by providing them the essential information they need, just as Dr. W had done for Mrs. T. I reflected on how access to information could have helped prevent this ED visit or her chronic kidney disease. Having grown up with a pharmacist at my side, I now realize that this was a privilege most individuals do not have. Had my mom not warned me about overusing medications, I could have experienced a similar fate.

I continued observing crucial conversations the attendings carried out with their patients, such as Mrs. T, or with family members, regarding a devastating new diagnosis or a loved one’s critical status. Recently, I experienced how it felt to receive upsetting news that clouded my mental state with worries and doubt. After weeks of anxiety-filled scheduling with multiple doctors and diagnostic testing, I was apprehensive of the elusive diagnosis my significant other, Kyle, faced. This would be our answer to why he had sudden left-sided visual changes. As a pilot, he could no longer fly, causing him stress, but mostly frustration, as he expected this would be temporary. After hearing that his eye was physically normal, I became terrified at the prospect of his symptoms having a neurological origin. Passing the time between each appointment, I did my best to stay positive and quell his fears, silently hoping this was an isolated occurrence. My uneasiness grew as he was admitted and given high-dose steroids after additional white matter lesions were discovered. 

I remained on edge after Kyle's discharge until the follow-up appointment a week later. We were placed in a small spotless, white-walled room with two chairs and a hospital bed. I took a seat and stared forever at the door we had just passed through until we heard a knock. Dr. S walked in, his shoulders squared but relaxed, exuding a calm confidence that seemed to spread over the room. I was not prepared when he stated, ""Kyle's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis appear[ed] to be more aggressive."" Alarm bells went off in my head, but Dr. S continued, ""but I have many patients who continue doing well on today's medication."" I exhaled the breath I was holding, and with less than 15 words, my trepidation that had built up over two months eased. I appreciated Dr. S's clarity and depth of explanation as he helped us start to understand and cope with this new information. I was awed by his ability to efficiently orchestrate Kyle’s care and develop a meaningful relationship with us in such a brief encounter. 

This emotional journey showed me how easy it was to become frustrated when navigating the healthcare system. From the other side of healthcare, this further enables me to relate more effectively to patients and their family members. I plan to emulate Dr. S's demeanor and continue to build and demonstrate empathy and kindness. Medicine has played a prominent role in shaping who I am today, and I commit myself to a lifetime of learning and meaningful interactions with my future patients and peers. As a caregiver, I hope to continually share with my patients why medication may not always be the answer and, as a patient advocate, ensure they are cared for not only physically but emotionally as well.","I was the teaching assistant when a lecturer made a generalization about Africa. Students expressed concern, but I was confused, my background rarely provoked incendiary comments. To better understand, I spoke with a colleague of African descent. She explained that blanket statements cannot describe the peoples or cultures a continent houses, and these comments perpetuate existing prejudices that may already be in place. I was embarrassed; I believed myself to be open-minded, yet only heard an anecdote, not disparaging remarks. Perhaps more painful, this is not an isolated occurrence; there have likely been past comments I did not recognize and certainly there will be more in the future. Still, it is my obligation to be cognizant of these challenges and suggest solutions. With this experience, I illuminated the vitriolic remarks to my department‚Äôs leadership and shared the new knowledge I acquired. Moving forward, I will continue to educate myself and highlight prejudice to my peers.","I was volunteering at the Illinois COVID Medical Recommendation Hotline when I received a call from a man who was extremely worried about his mother, she was having difficulty breathing.

Partway through our conversation, his demeanor shifted from angry to emotionally spent; my heart broke as he began to cry. I shared with him how he could obtain a test from his mother's primary care provider and provided my direct number in case he had any issues.

At the time I had no idea what being a surgeon entailed nor the dedication required to enter the medical field, but this seed of possibility grew stronger through the years as my understanding of the profession evolved. Medicine is not just a destination to be reached after many years of education but rather a journey whose continuous challenges I look forward to. As an undergraduate and a medical assistant, I came to appreciate the interplay between the empirical and interpersonal aspects of medicine. A physician does more than simply provide medical care; you must become an educator and an ally to your patients, and this is precisely the aspect of medicine that resonates with me most. 

I learned the importance of patient education during my college sophomore year while I was shadowing a pediatric neurologist. The doctor, who was counseling a mother about the results of her child’s DNA test, spent a large portion of the short 30-minute appointment explaining genetics in a way that was simple and understandable. Though the mother had no knowledge of genetics, the doctor made sure she understood what was happening to her child. Because I’ve spent so many years taking biology classes and learning about genetics, the simple explanation of a nonsynonymous base pair substitution made perfect sense to me. However, knowledge does not always translate to the ability to educate. Even though I understood the underlying genetics, I likely would not have been able to teach it so comprehensively. In fact, I would not have even thought to do so and thus would have left this patient in the dark about a major aspect of their medical care. This is somewhat ironic since a lack of understanding is something I have experienced with my own medical history. Over the past decade, I had many reconstructive dental procedures due to an accident in elementary school and I often found myself confused. Why did one of my teeth become infected and require extraction a full year after the accident? Why did I recently need a crown lengthening and why did this require sutures in place for a month that interfered with talking and eating? These gaps in understanding are avoidable and something I will work to prevent.  

Patient education will be an integral part of my medical journey to help patients be autonomous in their care, and this has so far guided the way I practice as a medical assistant. I work directly with patients before, during, and after their visits with the doctor, and much of the patient education falls into my hands after the doctor has left the visit. I always try to explain not only the “what” and “how” but also the “why” when it comes to medications, aftercare, and other questions that arise. It is not enough to simply tell a patient to put Vaseline on their biopsy site but to also explain that it will help the skin heal better and improve the appearance of the scar because it allows the skin cells to swim and thereby prevent scab formation. When patients understand the “why”, their care compliance improves. I have enjoyed learning various tricks of the trade that I can pass on to patients in order to help them understand their own treatment and increase the likelihood of achieving the best possible outcome.

I have also learned that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to medical care. One afternoon I was in a visit with a patient in her 90's. She had a lesion on her hand that the doctor felt needed to be excised that day, rather than just biopsied. After the visit, I bandaged the excision site, ensured that she understood all her aftercare instructions, and helped her get dressed. I chased down her doctor so that she could sign papers required by her care facility, and I made sure the patient’s driver had been contacted to take her home. I then walked her to the lab downstairs so she could complete her blood work. I helped check her in through the lab’s electronic system as nobody was at the front desk. This level of individual care was only possible because I could delegate some work to other members of my team to cover the slack while I helped this patient. I’ve learned to recognize the needs that individual patients carry and the value of a strong and dynamic team. It is our job to ensure that each patient gets the best start-to-finish care, and in this case it meant taking extra steps to ensure this patient was taken care of even after she left the office. 

My experiences have taught me that being a healthcare provider goes far beyond being a distributor of diagnoses and procedures. We must be allies with our patients to maximize the efficacy of our care. When doctors meet patients’ level of understanding and recognize their individual needs, they can act as guides and educators rather than just a steering force. Working in a medical practice has given me the opportunity to utilize my love of science in a way that educates and heals. Developing my ability to improve the lives of others through care and education is something I greatly anticipate as I progress through my medical career.","Performing in plays has bolstered my ability to empathize and connect with those who differ from me as acting requires putting yourself in the shoes of another person vastly different from yourself. I often play characters of different genders, backgrounds, and philosophies than myself, and a convincing performance necessitates understanding and empathy. One show I performed through the UVA Drama department involved a scene in which I played a character with cerebral palsy. While ideally the role should be portrayed by somebody who actually has cerebral palsy, I did a lot of research to make sure I performed in a way that was authentic and respectful of people with this condition. My acting journey has shaped the ways I interact in my current work as a medical assistant and I find that it is easier for me to connect with and understand my patients. This experience will make me well adapted to the types of diverse relationships I must form as a physician.","In Virginia, much like in the nation as a whole, structural inequalities have made it such that people of color are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured. Through my work at the Charlottesville Free Clinic, I aim to contribute to correcting some of these structural inequalities in my community. In one instance when I was scribing for an allergist, the patient had dermatological concerns. The doctor did not have a strong background in dermatology and invited me to discuss with him the various treatment options I‚Äôve become familiar with through my MA work and as such we were able to establish a treatment plan together. Though the problem of systemic discrimination is too large and deeply rooted for any one person to correct, the work of organizations like the Free Clinic are making important progress. I am excited that my background allows me to contribute to this effort and I look forward to the ability to make an even greater impact as my medical career continues",,,1,"Before the pandemic, I was working daily in my research lab, shadowing a pediatric neurologist, volunteering in the children‚Äôs hospital, and rehearsing for a play. I was lucky that the majority of my research could be done remotely, but I was never able to return to shadowing which was disappointing given my interest in the field. Though I could not volunteer in-person, I was still able to contribute to my organization as a program director. As a cast, we adjusted the script to fit an audio production and remotely recorded Shakespeare‚Äôs Twelfth Night as a radio drama. Though COVID did not change my decision to enter a career in medicine, the pandemic put me through challenges that have prepared me for what I will face during my journey. Like many of my peers, I had to work through feelings of fear and hopelessness to successfully complete the hardest year of my education, and I have come to realize how important my work will be and how much impact I can have on public health.",1,0,3

While my parents were away at their 9-5 jobs, my grandparents raised me, teaching me Chinese through stories and nursery rhymes. As a result, I did not realize other languages existed until I began preschool. This language barrier left my classmates as confused and scared of me as I was of them. I felt as though people were constantly talking at me, but I did not understand any of what was going on. Stuck in what seemed like a never-ending game of charades, I would frantically wave and point, while teachers threw out random words, trying to guess if I needed to use the bathroom or was simply throwing a fit. They would often give up and resort to calling my parents, for their limited English, to help translate. Thus, my parents were my voice when I felt as though I did not have my own.

Growing up, I noticed that confusion and dissatisfaction were familiar emotions to my parents as well.  Nobody around them slowed down to explain or to make sure they understood. They often resorted to smiling and nodding through each day, never fully able to grasp what others were saying. My parents lived in a world of distrust and opaqueness—much like I had as a child—wherein there was much noise with little understanding. 

It wasn’t long before I surpassed my parents’ English abilities and took over the role of translator for my family. As a second-generation immigrant, I became a bridge between two worlds. Although it was a challenge holding up lines while I explained ticket prices at amusement parks and asking waiters for their patience while I explained menus in restaurants, I slowly realized this was an opportunity to connect my parents’ thoughts and desires into words. This role taught me to listen, both to the words and the intentions behind them, allowing me to develop a skill for noticing patterns of miscommunication beyond those present in language.

Inspired by my experiences translating for my parents, I trained to become a crisis hotline volunteer to continue advocating for those without a voice. I remember the sharp ringing of the telephone on my very first call in which I was greeted with a shaky “Hello,” full of uncertainty and skepticism. As the caller explained his struggles dealing with depression and OCD all while taking care of his sick mother, I gave him the space to explore his feelings. At first, he simply needed someone to talk to. But as I validated and empathized with his frustrations, he became more comfortable and confided that he felt he could no longer take care of himself. Together, we began exploring different resources from therapy to inpatient hospital services.  By the end of our call, I could sense a shift in his tone. He became more empowered and optimistic as he learned about these opportunities for help. 

I found purpose in helping someone build a path to health and guiding them through their journey. But I found myself wondering what would happen to these callers after hanging up, feeling a sense of unease over their well-being. This sparked my desire to help others through face-to-face interactions and direct patient contact. Joining a volunteer rescue squad as an EMT, I was able to personally treat patients and ensure they received the care they needed. 

One of my most memorable days was when I was dispatched to a motor vehicle accident, where I met “Choe.” I first saw Choe sitting in the driver seat of his wrecked car with a lost expression that I found all too familiar. As I jumped off the ambulance, a group of confused firefighters and medics were quick to inform me he couldn’t speak English. While others around me frantically talked at him, I made my way to him, kneeled to his eye level, and listened. With some patience, I discovered his native tongue was Tibetan, but he spoke some Chinese. Through the comfort of our shared language, I could see the fear dissipate from his eyes. Staying beside him, I quickly directed a firefighter to contact a translator from the hospital, as I explained to Choe what was happening. The more we communicated, the calmer he felt, and the more he trusted me to treat him. It wasn’t just my broken Chinese that made him feel safe, but rather the compassion and effort to truly understand him. I realized that my ability to connect with him was vital in informing him about his physical condition and treatment plan.

Through my experiences with Choe and others like him, I have come to consider communication as a vehicle through which I can break down barriers in medicine. I believe empathetic listening is the heart of medicine and patient care. With each patient I have interacted with, I have had the opportunity to hear their stories and appreciate their fears. I hope to utilize medicine and communication to help patients better understand and take control of their own health. As I continue to enrich my journey through medicine, I want to be a bridge of understanding, making sure others do not have to face the same struggles my parents and I experienced. Through my passion for patient interaction and communication, I envision myself as a doctor that listens to the words and emotions of my patients to guide them towards physical and mental health.","Volunteering in rural Virginia, I have consistently interacted with individuals suffering from untreated chronic health issues. As a healthcare worker, I often found myself wondering how they could allow their conditions to get so bad. However, by listening to these patients‚Äô histories, I realized they didn‚Äôt have much choice in the matter. The more I volunteered, the more I noticed this pattern throughout the community. Patients refused to go to the hospital because they were afraid of the bills. Others lived with undiagnosed mental illnesses as they had no access to mental health services. Witnessing these struggles first-hand has made me more conscious of the problems each patient faces outside of their disease; lack of accessible and affordable health care services perpetuated their conditions. At Rush Medical College, I aim to apply this knowledge and arrive at a better understanding of each patient, treating them in the context of their whole life, beyond their illness alone.","I heard a quiet but persistent knocking coming from outside the rescue station at 2AM. I opened the door to find a man in standing in the cold, anxiously requesting to go to the hospital. Discovering he was homeless, I realized that treating his cough with a transport to the ER was not enough. I informed him of the local homeless shelter I volunteered at and contacted social workers at the hospital, ensuring he received the proper help and resources. At my next shift at the homeless shelter, I was relieved to see him in line getting food, and to hear he had found transitional housing. Throughout my college career, have met several patients like him that needed much more than medical assessments: they needed an advocate. I realized that as a healthcare worker, I had a responsibility to fight for the needs of others, especially those who cannot do so themselves. Through RCSIP clinics, I will advocate for individuals in the underserved Chicago communities, providing accessible healthcare.",,,1,"March of 2020 felt like a nightmare. One day, I was going home for spring break, and the next, the school had shut down and I was told not to return. The pandemic was escalating, and everything was put to a halt. As an EMT, I saw the effects in the healthcare community immediately. Half of my rescue station consisted of student volunteers, myself included, who were all sent home due to the pandemic. Crews were unable to staff even one full ambulance and remaining volunteers were working additional shifts to fill the gaps. At this crucial juncture of the pandemic, I felt a responsibility to help not only the patients but also the healthcare community as they risked their lives every day. This cumulated in my decision to leave home and live off-campus to resume volunteering. Seeing how healthcare workers came together during this crisis and their commitment to those around them has inspired and strengthened my desire to be a part of that community.",1,0,3

My partner and I talked in the ambulance, parked in our usual spot on our graveyard shift. The radio squawked suddenly: a gas station address for a psychiatric call. As we arrived, we saw our patient, barefoot, sitting surrounded by the police and firemen, drinking water. Mascara ran down her face, and her hands shook with fear. She immediately grabbed my arm and wailed, “Please, don't make me go back, please.” I began asking questions, trying to get some context, but she was in shock and mumbled only gibberish. As my partner reached out to take her vitals, she panicked and became extremely hostile. Having experienced similar situations with my mother, when no words would make her think reasonably, I knew what to do. I took a deep breath, knelt down, and began explaining to her exactly what we were doing in as much detail as I could so she would know we weren’t trying to hurt her. “We just want you to make sure you’re OK,” I said calmly. “Would you let me just check your blood pressure? We're not going to hurt you.”
***

My sister held me tight, her soothing voice telling me it was going to be OK. All I could hear was screaming through the locked closet door. My 6-year-old self could only ponder what was happening. We sat on the floor staring at the door as it rattled with the echoes of the loud, muffled screams. “Give me my children, give me my children, don’t steal them from me!” was all I could hear as my mother hurled herself against the door to my room. Her father, husband, and brother tried to calm her, trying to reassure that we weren’t being taken; no words they said could give her peace of mind. This was the first time I encountered my mother’s manic episode. As children, we experience a lot of firsts, your first steps, your first day of school, but there’s nothing quite like the first time you experience a disorder that can often be ‘invisible’ to the physical realm, but so impactful to everyone it touches. But this experience became a turning point to diving into the world of psychosis, for it was certainly not the last time I’d encounter my mother’s bipolar disorder.

As a child I always had a fascination with the sciences. Participating in the HMS MEDscience Simulation Lab program, I found my love for medicine, the human body, and its various physiological systems. I learned the importance of communication in a clinical setting, as well as other medical history and techniques such as suturing, gallbladder surgery simulations, intubation, and more. As I continued my journey as an undergraduate, I discovered Tufts’ Clinical Psychology major and gained research experience in one of the best psychiatric hospitals in the country: McLean Hospital. Suddenly, the complex world of psychiatric disorders became a lot more clear to me, from their origin to their treatment, and I found something I wanted to be a part of, something that my past experiences had shaped me into pursuing.

That night at the gas station, our patient began to relax after my attempt to calm her, which I quickly used to my advantage and took her vitals. The officers told us she and her husband had gotten into an altercation, and when he hit her, she ran to the closest place she felt safe, the gas station. She insisted she didn’t want to press charges, that she loved him and knew he didn’t mean it – a clear sign of a potentially abusive household. But she did not want to go back to her house that night. I reassured her the hospital would be the best place for her to stay for the night as the police handled things, that she would be surrounded by people trying to help her and keep her safe however they could. I was grateful that night for the tactics I learned from my mother's manic episodes, exuding calm and successfully treating the patient when hostility and fear ruled her emotions. We got the patient the help she needed when she wouldn't listen to reason from any other source. 

The complexity of mental disorders has been clear in my studies. My work in McLean’s Pre-Clinical Behavioral Biology Lab has shown the journey pharmacological treatments go through before reaching clinical trials and later becoming established treatments for disorders. I have learned not only the mechanisms of various abused substances to better understand their receptors of action and the behavioral depressive effects they can cause, but also the effects of new and better potential antidepressant treatments being studied. Although psychological therapies are extremely useful, sometimes medication is the only treatment, since the root cause is a chemical imbalance. As a psychiatrist, my goal would be to combine these approaches to help others as my mother’s psychiatrist helped us and to become a resource for those individuals who are standing where I was 18 years ago. Pursuing psychiatry and its capacity for healing not only illness and disorder but the holistic balance of human health will allow me to transform lives and to bring awareness and treatment to the communities I hold so dear. No longer the scared little boy in the closet, I can turn his fear and pain into a passion for restoring peace and hope to patients and families who once suffered as he did.","Shadowing pediatric neurologist Dr. Alcy Torres was a chance to learn more about the neural and cerebral disorders that can lead to a psychiatric referral and better understand the overlap between these fields. As I had no prior exposure to autism, Dr. Torres took the time to educate me on the relationship between ADHD and autism as well as interaction strategies he uses in treating his autistic patients. He explained that autistic patients tend to have a ‚Äúspecial interest,‚Äù a point of hyperfocus that can be an opening to connect with the patient to elicit more trust but can also restrict treatment if they become oblivious to other questions. He explained the need for balance in interacting with these children so they don‚Äôt get lost in the topic, and he alerted me to how quickly they may become overstimulated, teaching me to take things at a pace comfortable for the patient. Expanding my ability to meet my patients where they are like this broadens my ability to be an effective doctor.","Service through the student-led Tufts Kidney Disease Screening and Awareness Club allowed me to provide free healthcare to communities facing challenges accessing such screenings. As someone familiar with the disparity of healthcare in Mexico, I had been unaware of similar disparities here, since the U.S. is always glorified as having ‚Äúbetter‚Äù opportunities and services. This was really a wake up call, and I have made it a goal as an aspiring psychiatrist to have my own practice providing mental health services to those otherwise unable to access such care due to the cost of services. I used cultural empathy and humility in working with these patients, because they were often nervous or embarrassed to be seeking this type of care ‚Äì a clear systemic crisis, for no one should feel less than worthy of medical care. The help I provided through this club solidified not only my goal to be a physician but also my wish to give back to the communities that have given me so much in my life.",,,1,"To me, COVID-19 was an exercise in adaptability. While stuck at home, I found creative outlets in gardening, crocheting, dance, and making art, but Tufts' swift, effective response meant the pandemic had no real impact on the quality of my academic experience. Although I took half of the Biochemistry course online, as well as Physics 1 and 2 in the summer before senior year, my professors made online lessons work well. However, my professional opportunities shifted. I had secured an internship in Summer 2020 to assist on an OCD study, but this was paused due to in-person restrictions, and I participated in a student visitorship program involving OCD instead. Studying for the MCAT during the biggest wave of the pandemic also wasn‚Äôt easy. Unsatisfied with my first score, after refocusing my energies on school for my senior year and beginning to work in research, I reattempted the MCAT.

My mother was diagnosed with a chronic mental disorder and for the first time, I felt incapable of helping her. As her symptoms worsened, she began to spend most of her time isolated in her room, eventually losing her job and any source of income. I offered what I could: getting my younger brother and I ready for school, preparing meals, and cleaning the house. Still, as she was the head of the household, I knew this situation was unsustainable. Bills began to accumulate and my studies faltered. Toward the end of that first semester, I sat down with my mom to have a difficult conversation about her condition. We talked for hours, exploring what felt like every possible solution and alternative, including reaching out to extended family members for help.

“Maybe your brother and I should move to Boston and live with your uncle, while you stay in Pittsburgh with your grandmother for school,” my mother suggested. My uncle lived near resources that he could connect my mother with, including a psychiatrist who specialized in her condition. While I realized this would be the best option for my mother’s health and I agreed with her decision, I also felt uncertain. My mother had previously been my pillar of support. The idea of her leaving made my heart drop, even though I knew it was necessary for her to get better. Witnessing the effects of this chronic illness showed me not only the consequences health could have on a fragile household, but also the impact that I could have. By being a supportive presence during my mother’s ailment and encouraging her to take steps toward receiving the care she needed, I was able to help. While I was not the physician prescribing her medication, I could still assist her by reassuring her. I dream of becoming a physician who can provide both of these means of support for my patients one day.

With the help of her physician and medication, my mother’s condition improved, demonstrating to me the immense impact the medical field could have on an individual and the type of impact I hoped to create. I began to seek out opportunities to pursue my newfound interest in medicine, and realized I wanted to work directly with patients who were under-resourced to help provide avenues of support. I decided to continue my passion of working with patients by volunteering at the UPMC Children’s Hospital before my junior year of college. One day while doing rounds, I came across a young patient and her mother. The only light in their room was coming from the television, and I quickly realized from their surprise that they were not expecting a volunteer. In an effort to lift the girl’s spirits, I asked if I could talk with her, and discovered we had a shared interest in drawing. She mentioned she wanted to draw while being in the hospital but did not have any materials. After hearing this, I assured her we had art supplies in the hospital and went to retrieve some. I’ll never forget the look of delight on her and her mother’s face when I walked in with a notebook and a pencil kit. I could feel the girl’s excitement as we continued our conversation until the end of my volunteering shift. That was the first time I understood the healing impact I could have on a patient's experience by cultivating an environment of compassion and support.

In my path toward becoming a physician, I know that I will not always have the opportunity to sit down and talk for hours with my patients. However, I do hope that my experiences will help me see beyond the hospital gown. As a clinical research assistant, I witnessed neurologist Dr. Harel accomplish just this when working with a patient who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), listening as the patient expressed frustration and hopelessness at the rapid progression of his disease. Dr. Harel chose to make a genuine human connection with the patient through their mutual love of baseball. Suddenly, the energy in the room shifted and it felt as though I was listening to two friends discuss their favorite baseball teams, although eternal rivals, in between discussions of treatment plans. Though the circumstances were quite different, I quickly saw parallels between his ALS patient and the pediatric patients I met while volunteering at UPMC, both of whom had placed their trust in the healthcare team in hopes of navigating their medical situations.

I dream of navigating these situations alongside patients as a physician, offering the comfort I have personally seen change lives. As in the care I saw with my mother and the patients I’ve worked with, I hope to foster a therapeutic alliance by connecting with vulnerable people to enhance their care. Drawing from these experiences, I envision the role of a physician to extend far beyond medicine to encompass leadership, advocacy, and problem-solving, and I am eager to flesh out this vision in my commitment to the journey of lifelong learning as a physician.","At the Bronx VA, I worked daily with former veterans whose experiences varied greatly from mine. While it felt daunting at first to work with people much older than me, I learned how to form connections with these patients. Working with study participants, I often found our conversations veered toward the person‚Äôs life, and that patients wanted medical professionals who were empathetic to their experiences and struggles. I saw the importance of being open-minded and non-judgmental to helping people that I saw everyday. This attribute allowed participants to feel comfortable sharing any symptoms that they had with me so I could provide the best treatment for them during a session. Our interactions also showed me the challenges that people with chronic conditions face such as isolation, especially those from vulnerable populations. Similarly, I hope to form connections with Chicago‚Äôs diverse patient population to understand how I can address their needs.","Having studied the determinants of health at the School of Social Work, I wanted to apply my understanding of health disparities to create projects to improve local health outcomes during the pandemic. Through Columbia‚Äôs United Against Inequities in Disease (UAID) chapter, I helped organize a drive to create 160 COVID kits for people in Harlem experiencing homelessness. Witnessing the impact our chapter of 20 students could create underscored for me the importance of collaboration in addressing the needs of others. I‚Äôm eager to see what UAID continues to do and know that as long as our mission of helping the surrounding community stays strong, our impact will be sustained. I hope to create a similar impact on the Chicago community as a student at Rush through its Road Home Program, where I can learn how to practice as a physician who addresses the needs of my patients. I know Rush will provide me with the resources to make tangible change through partnerships and active communication.",,,1,"Once Columbia‚Äôs campus closed due to the pandemic, I moved back home to complete classes online.

Despite only meeting him thirty minutes ago, I accost my youngest half-sibling with questions: “what is that? What about that? And that?” We pull up to the second window, and my stepmom hands each of us a box of fries. At that moment, I had already forgotten the horrific 10-hour flight where I had cried myself to sleep on the shoulder of my oldest half-brother whom, like the other two, I had met a few months before that flight. I moved to Massachusetts from Ghana in 2008, leaving my mom and two maternal half-siblings behind to live with my dad, who was also nearly a stranger to me. It was the hardest thing I have done, and the only justification my dad gave me was that this was the “American Dream.” The idea of limitless potential and opportunities to do or become anything, but as a nine-year-old it did not feel like it.
 
I struggled for the first few years in America as I tried to assimilate to western culture. I fell behind in classes as I tried to understand the intricacies of the English language. I couldn’t find anything I enjoyed learning until I started the human anatomy and physiology unit in my life science class in 7th grade. During those few weeks, I found myself more engaged in my studies than ever before. It was not until my 3rd oldest sibling fell ill to pneumonia and had to be hospitalized for several days that I witnessed and appreciated how resilient the human body can be in its ever-changing environment. Visiting my brother in the hospital, I was overwhelmed with the sight of him lying motionless and lethargic. I observed as the physicians and nurses did their best to bring my brother from near death to his joyful self. I saw my brother garner more energy each day to talk and play with me. It was during that time that I discovered my interest in medicine. I hoped to one day help bring someone else’s brother or sister back home.
 
Fast forward to the summer of 2017, I began the 6-month journey to become a Combat Medic in the Massachusetts Army National Guard. In training, presented with various medical and trauma scenarios, I worked to save the lives of my simulation patients while adapting and improvising with limited to non-existent supplies. I learned to treat sucking chest wounds using plastic packaging and tape to prepare for combat situations where commercial chest seals are not available. I learned a lot from working with simulators but making the transition to real patients was a welcomed challenge. Following a training exercise in the scorching summer heat of Texas, a trainee collapsed to the ground. As other medics worked to pack them with ice sheets, I struggled to establish an IV line on an arm without ideal mannequin veins. After a successful second stick, I unclamped the IV tubing and let the lactated ringers run bolus. Within minutes EMS arrived and the trainee was sent off to a higher echelon of care. As the ambulance sped away, I wished I had the knowledge and skill set to ensure their recovery. I used this experience to fuel my already burning passion to become a physician.
 
My training experience opened many doors and opportunities. My first hospital job as a patient care technician was at Emerson Hospital, a small community hospital in Concord, Massachusetts surrounded by several nursing homes. Spending countless shifts sitting with patients with dementia, I try to emulate the professionalism, candor, and empathy of the physicians and nurses with whom I worked with as I reassure patients they are safe. In room 544 bed 1 in a medical/surgical unit, the wife of a retired Stanford professor and I gently stroke the chest, arms, and legs of her husband to make him aware of our presence. Although he did not close his eyes to rest that night, our hands kept him calm through the night. No matter how distant your consciousness may be, the touch of another human on your body brings you to a present stimulus. I recognized how difficult it can be to care for patients with dementia or altered mental status. Nights like these taught me little lessons that I will bring with me while caring for my patients as a future physician.
 
Since I discovered my interest in medicine at my brother’s hospital bedside, I have worked tirelessly to achieve the “American Dream” I could not envision as a nine-year-old. From the first time I treated a soldier with a severely blistered foot, to the time I cleaned up a dementia patient covered with urine and stool, I’ve met numerous individuals from different walks of life. During people’s trying times, I’ve had the pleasure of making many laugh when they are feeling down, being a calming hand in times of uncertainty, a listening ear, and a shoulder to cry on. The moments I have shared with these individuals during their most vulnerable state, has drawn me further into medicine. As I continue my journey, I hope to draw on these experiences to help me provide exceptional care for my patients.","‚ÄúThe only colors you have to worry about are green and red because at the end of the day, we are all in the same green uniform and we all bleed red.‚Äù Drill Sergeant Tucker lectured my platoon several times during the first couple weeks of basic training whenever he noticed racial cliques. To address this issue, our platoon spent a few nights trying to get to know each other. Sitting on the floor in an open bay, we took turns discussing our motivation to join the Army. A few people like myself joined for the educational benefits. Some joined for citizenship, while others joined for family benefits. Some joined to escape their old habits and lifestyles, while others joined to serve their country. By the end of the training cycle, although we had different backgrounds and motivations, we trained and excelled together. I learned to value our collective differences because it was often a strength that complimented our individual weaknesses.","Two years ago, my close friend, Tate, expressed that he felt lost in life and had no idea what to do with himself. During high school, he was a part of the machine tool technology program offered through our school. Post-grad he realized that he had no interest in the field, so he was unsure what to do. He spent the first few years after high school, moving from job to job with zero interest in any of them.  In the Army, I knew several individuals who at some point felt similarly who now have civil service careers. After a few late night conversations with Tate, he expressed that he would see himself as a fire-fighter. I helped him apply to the fire protection and safety program at Bunker Hill Community College. Since then, he has had two successful semesters and has recently completed an EMT course. He is on track to complete the remaining two semesters of the program before he plans to take the civil service exam. It is rewarding to see my friend excel in his newly found passion.   _x000D_

Working at a high school in “Southside” Phoenix, however, this idea is seldom evident. As a gender nonconforming racial minority, I’ve become adept at disregarding whispered indignities about my clothing choices and sideways glares from people that don’t look like me, but nothing can match the brazenly weaponized ignorance of teenagers. Walking the hallways expands one’s vocabulary; there are slurs for every color of the rainbow, doubled for those of us that understand some Spanish. The words disappoint more than they sting.

I had taken a position working with students that required behavioral interventions, naïvely expecting to shepherd every would-be dropout, bathroom smoker, and cafeteria brawler back onto a track of academic and interpersonal success while hopefully improving the school’s culture. A few weeks after starting, my optimistic intentions and I took a stroll through the “M” building and were splintered by the verbal warzone that succinctly demonstrated my impotence at the school level. My beliefs held firm, but I was disturbed by the realization of my inefficacy.
Desperate to provide what respite I could for students, I started a weekly LGBT+ support group. The group’s aim was simple: to provide a safe space for students to escape the hostility they faced in class, at home, or in the community. It wasn’t long after the group began that I was assigned to meet a student that went by “Z”. With their bright green hair and shaved eyebrows, Z had a unique appearance—a valiant gamble for a tenth grader. After we bonded over not fitting expected gender roles, they opened up about their trauma from home, their suicide attempts, and how they felt alienated at school. Having been personally affected by suicide, I wanted to do everything in my power to improve Z’s mental health to avoid tragedy. Not able to address their illness directly, I recommended they join the support group.

After a few weeks of gentle convincing and reminding, Z was finally introduced to the group. When given the floor, Z’s downcast eyes were locked on their black combat boots while they feebly shared their experiences of domestic nonacceptance and internal turmoil. They sorrowfully concluded with “…and I have no friends.” To Z’s bewilderment, this declaration was met with defiance: “That’s not true!” A voice warmly rang. “I’ll be your friend!” For the first time, Z’s eyes lifted, and in them I saw hope. I fought back tears as the movie moment unfolded. All tribulations of ignorance were forgotten. I felt an immense sense of pride in the environment that I had provided. Strangers showed one another love—all it took was an opportunity. After that experience I’ve become sensitive to these instances, where regardless of circumstance or demographic, people can show true compassion.
Hospitals provide the setting for a wealth of these opportunities. As a patient resource tech, I spent most of my time “sitting” with high-risk patients. Not only did this allow me to observe the full interdisciplinary care process, but I also felt like an integral team member, and had the unique position of focusing all my attention on one patient for a full twelve hours. There was the occasional TBI patient that mistook my shoes for a urinal, but overall I did as much as I could to improve patients’ moods, which had ripple effects throughout their stay.

I was most impacted by my first solo sitting assignment: a paranoid schizophrenic around my age named Don. Though unable to hold a conversation, we were able to chat and get to understand one another. In between bouts of fighting demons only visible to him, he told me of his likes and dislikes, his hobbies, why Giannis was his favorite basketball player, and how much he loved his mom. When his mom came to visit, the years of exhaustion were clearly identifiable from her face and tone. I was tortured by a familiar feeling of inefficacy. I could comfort Don and assure him that it wasn’t his fault that he was in the hospital, but I couldn't help quiet the haunting voices or tell his mother why her baby mistook a hospital room for hell. As I left my shift that day, I thanked Don for sharing his story with me and let him know how much I had enjoyed his company. Remembering the sincerity of the smile he gave in return still brings tears. The hopeful look in his eyes was the same that I had seen in Z’s. Don demonstrated that the worse one’s circumstances, the more they blossom when shown kindness. Albeit small, I was glad to have seized the opportunity.

I formed a space where Z could find a friend, but couldn’t treat their depression. I consoled Don when he feared damnation, but couldn’t ameliorate his symptoms. I provided opportunities for these people to be shown love for a moment, but they deserve the power to create opportunities for themselves throughout their own lives. I believe that medicine is the most direct means through which we can restore others’ self-efficacy in this regard. I hope to build a career of spreading the privilege of seeing the same expression Z and Don showed, and above all, I am determined to spend my life creating opportunities by utilizing medicine to reclaim and preserve others’ control over their lives.","My sensitivity to the homelessness crisis developed as a patient resource technician at St. Joseph‚Äôs Medical Center in downtown Phoenix. Throughout the pandemic, I noticed an increase in ER cases of suicidal ideation requiring a patient sitter. Unfortunately, the majority of my sitter assignments were individuals that lacked stable housing. After connecting with many patients, it became clear that the most vulnerable populations suffered the most severe economic consequences. To make matters worse, many of my patients had additional health conditions that were left untreated. Between a lack of affordable housing, a lack of accessible healthcare, and a rampant lethal virus, it became understandable why our cases of suicidality had increased. The supports in place are overcrowded and underfunded, while seeking help is still stigmatized. I believe that through research and community education it may be possible to lessen the stigma, and increase momentum for forward-thinking legislation.","I have worked to improve high school dropout rates by overwriting my school‚Äôs discipline practices._x000D_
_x000D_
South Mountain High School‚Äôs graduation rate is 12% below national average due to many pushout factors such as punitive behavioral management policies. I accepted a position that oversaw in-school suspension (ISS), and had the unique opportunity to modernize the program. When I filled the vacancy, ISS became an option that replaced many off-school suspensions. More importantly, I used the classroom to perform behavioral interventions, teach social/emotional learning, tutor all subjects, and provide a cooldown space for students with impulse management issues. _x000D_
_x000D_
Outside the classroom, I‚Äôve pushed to update our practices according to research evidence to include restorative processes and minimize suspension time. I believe my contributions have mitigated dropouts while improving the culture surrounding how students‚Äô behavior is addressed. ",,,1,"After graduating, I landed the perfect job as a school nutrition manager. My family‚Äôs needs were met, my MCAT study schedule inked out, and my plan felt flawless. _x000D_

I took a second job at a COVID-19 testing site, and began to spend all my hours either at work or caring for my family. Medical school applications were my top career priority, but the needs of my loved ones were greater. I delayed my MCAT and had no time to study. In addition, physicians weren‚Äôt allowing shadowing due to safety precautions, and in-person volunteering saw the same treatment. The robustness of my application suffered as a result, but I‚Äôm proud to have stood in the face of uncertainty to serve my community as a tester and vaccine administrator.

The grandiose fish tanks. The glittering, cityscape mosaics. The ball machine designed by George Rhoads. These memorable features seemed to welcome me back with each new injury: a wrist shattered on the basketball court; an ankle snapped on the soccer field; a finger bent in the entirely wrong direction, when I refused to fumble on the football field; and an arm fractured by a classmate, who thought the playground offered the perfect venue to practice her new karate moves.
When the physicians arrived, I studied their handling of my swollen joints, turning them over, pressing, and asking, “Does this hurt? What about here?” I squealed in pain. Sometimes I was met with a smile. Sometimes, an apology. I was confused. Did I pass the test? Was this a good thing, or a bad thing, this confirmation of pain? I saw so many physicians, I began recognizing individual personalities reflected in their responses. One doctor, in particular, stood out. I was not greeted by the usual “...so I’ve looked at your X-rays…” Instead, he introduced himself, looked me in the eye, and probed: “How are you feeling?” 
I was stunned. Why was this physician asking how I felt? What about the pain test? I was caught off guard by the question, and within it, an unspoken understanding contrived of simplicity and decency. I felt recognized. Seen. Vulnerable in my injured state, yet cared for and in the presence of someone who understood that I was more than my injury. 
I don’t remember how I answered his question, but I do remember carrying its significance with me to UCLA. While heading to a freshmen orientation event promising “2 for 1 Diddy Riese” cookie dough sandwiches, as I walked along the Westwood sidewalk, instead of chocolate baked goodness, I smelled urine. Then I noticed a seemingly endless row of tents, blistered swollen feet poking through. Ice cream scoopers half-smiled behind cookie dough counters, unsure of whether or not to acknowledge the people camped in makeshift homes. 
Suddenly, I was brought back to my doctor’s visit; my physician had made a choice to recognize me, and I could choose to do the same for these people. I wasn’t yet trained to treat injuries, but I had been shown how to treat a patient. Instead of ignoring the homeless as a symptom of Westwood’s inequity, I wanted to help.
So I joined MEDLIFE, an organization offering medical, social, and legal services to the Los Angeles homeless population. I jumped into the Bruin van and cruised down the 405, arriving at the local McDonalds parking lot to slap together peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. John, a Skid Row resident, greeted me with five simple words: “It smells like ass here.” He wasn’t lying. While I handed out sandwiches, our chat evolved, and in between stories of his son’s escapades, I noticed him jumping from foot to foot. I saw my moment. Glancing at his feet and then back up to his eyes, I asked, “How are you feeling? He looked down and whispered, “Well it feels like I’m walking on fire honestly.” As I directed him to primary care services, I was both grateful and motivated. The opportunity to connect with John and create a safe space where he felt comfortable sharing with me how he felt is something I will never forget. As his feet were being examined, I realized my interaction with John was just the beginning. I knew I was capable of more.
 As I rode back to UCLA, I recalled moments in the hospital when my only understanding of suffering was a broken bone. And the bones hurt, believe me. But I didn’t have to worry about access to medical care, and I didn’t know that others did. I could always count on my mom to get me to the ER, where I received elite medical care, before returning to the comforts of home. A hot, nutritious meal. Relieved siblings signing my casts. A warm, cozy bed to climb into. All integral to healing. Exiting the van, I felt my lens readjust: I now saw medicine seeped in social nuance, and the need to address both social and biological factors to help patients like John.
Today, I reflect on that physician’s acknowledgement of me, as both patient and person, and recognize what I couldn’t as a young kid. That he, one of the doctors I used to think of as an all-knowing entity, was also a person, continuing to grow and learn in his practice, just like me. When I think about pursuing medicine today, I know my views, my goals, and my self-awareness have grown immensely from that first visit to Boston Children’s. Not only have I graduated from backyard ice jumps to park halfpipes, but I’ve found new means of promoting health. I question how to ethically serve people, I look for new ways to recognize social factors and biological differences among individual patients, and I continue to hold close that moment when I was first treated as a patient, not as an injury. I know that my medical philosophy will continually be challenged and amended. And that’s perhaps what excites me most about pursuing a career in medicine.","After revealing her HIV+ status, the patient addressed the circumstances that had necessitated a visit to the clinic: a swollen belly and nausea. With two children at home and no partner present, the mother explained that she could not support another baby. The problem: South Africa required women to file a request to abort if past the twelve-week mark. I stood in silence, nodding at the patient to put her at ease and watching the physician to see how he would respond to a difficult situation. _x000D_
Finally he spoke, offering her a scrap piece of paper with scribbled digits. ‚ÄúIf you run into any issues, give them this.‚Äù_x000D_
My mind reeled. Is this wrong? Is this ethical? This interaction in Khayelitsha, South Africa, made me realize that the physician‚Äôs job is more than treating a patient‚Äôs physical symptoms; proper health care embodies a balancing act of autonomy and beneficence, of social awareness and attention to psychological health. ","Lining the road to Table Mountain, piles of newspapers warned of the recent escalation in violence: ‚Äú56 killed in Khayelitsha‚Äù, ‚ÄúTourists killed hiking‚Äù. The University of Cape Town canceled outdoor activities and professors advised students to stick in pairs. Fearing for my safety, I questioned if I should forgo my studies in South Africa._x000D_
Then in August, international news publicized the horrific killing of student Uyinene Mrwetyana. The university canceled classes and coordinated a memorial. Local organizers planned a march to protest the senseless violence. I felt out of place, alone, and scared. As both an outsider and a member of the student body, I didn‚Äôt know whether to give the locals space or to grieve alongside them. Torn, I asked Kevin, a Capetonian, for advice._x000D_
‚ÄúNo one would blame you for not going, but if international students participate, it draws attention to how serious this is.‚Äù With Kevin‚Äôs help, I overcame my fears and marched for the right to feel safe. ",,,1,"The pandemic raised dozens of new problems I didn‚Äôt have answers to. I knew bioethical principles should guide how American society acted; yet, it was not until COVID-19 overwhelmed state hospitals and underscored national health disparities that I understood how the set of ethical guidelines I clung to failed to remedy novel dilemmas. In this way, the pandemic forced me to re-examine my commitment to medicine. _x000D_

I enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Masters of Science in Bioethics. I familiarized myself with the ethical questions surrounding clinical practice. I learned case-based approaches for ethical dilemmas and applications of biotechnology for real-life scenarios.

As I learned more, I realized the scale of his unspoken struggles, as Jacob was quietly battling against anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. This was the start of my pursuit of medicine. Reflecting on how the pervasive stigma of mental health conditions further isolated him and worsened his health, I wanted to help Jacob and others like him.
It was out of this desire that I decided to volunteer for the Crisis Text Line, where texters are often suffering from mental health disorders and reach out in times of crisis. As a counselor, I’ve witnessed the effects that complex backgrounds and identities can have on mental health as well as the inequity in mental healthcare accessibility. I feel privileged to help narrow the equity gap by providing a service that does not turn anyone away. While I am continuously learning how to best support each texter, I have found that approaching the conversation with compassion and without judgment is always the start. I learned that in my future, I want to provide healthcare to communities of people who are historically underserved. As a physician, I will advocate for those facing healthcare injustices, knowing that many patients are struggling with systemic discrimination that is outside their control.
To broaden my experience, I became a certified nursing assistant (CNA) and started working in a nursing home. The geriatric population is notoriously under-supported, and I saw this problem worsen dramatically during the pandemic. With constant understaffing, my first few shifts left me feeling overwhelmed, but I soon learned to manage my time and promote the team environment. I enjoyed maximizing the strengths of the other CNAs and dividing the workload for the essentials, such as getting each resident out of bed, changed, and taken to the bathroom. This required constant communication among CNAs and the floor nurse, and over time our team worked more efficiently. My ability to work in a team was recognized by our CNA coordinator, and I was assigned to train new CNAs on the floor, teaching them the specific care for each resident and how to manage their many responsibilities. I instilled in new trainees the importance of fundamentals like using a gait belt to assist residents and finding a second person when needed. In my future, I will strive to be a strong leader who prioritizes safety and won’t cut corners. I will continue to value all team members and promote communication and collaboration within our team.
Through my work in the nursing home, I witnessed that medicine is moving toward a more wholistic approach that develops care unique to a patient’s needs and priorities. I once accompanied “Jane” to her neurology appointment. Jane had Parkinson’s Disease, and she exhibited severe symptoms of dementia and responded slowly to questions. At first, her neurologist skipped over her when asking questions, looking instead to me for answers. But he quickly learned she just needed extra time and was patient with her after each question. He caught his assumptions of her abilities and adjusted his communication technique. I admired his humility, flexibility, and attention to the subtleties of an individual. Like the neurologist, I demonstrated patience toward the residents, listening to them and designing my care to their individual needs. Some residents needed me to speak or move slower when helping them, while others preferred that I move quickly to let them get back to what they were doing. I enjoyed learning who each resident was and customizing their care. I found deep connections with them, seeing each resident as a unique individual and the shortcomings of a one-size-fits-all approach. I plan to continue this practice in medicine through developing personalized care for each patient.
After caring for the nursing home residents, I wanted to participate in scientific research, so I began working as a research technician at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. I have had the opportunity to lead a project to investigate how the histone chaperone SET assists in adenovirus infection, an infection which can be dangerous for elderly patients like Jane. I aim to better understand the intricacies of how this virus interrupts host cell function. From my research experience, I appreciate the long pipeline that connects research with clinical treatments and am excited to create therapies for aggressive disease. As a physician, I will apply my knowledge of disease to guide the care of my patients and continue my own research to develop better treatments.
Through my experiences as a Crisis Counselor and CNA, I have a sense of the qualities needed to succeed as a compassionate physician and collegial part of a medical team. My research experiences have added to my understanding of the science of medicine and helped me better appreciate research as the foundation of new therapies. In my future, I hope to use my voice to build toward equitable medicine, help create better treatments for patients like Jane, and design unique care to the needs of my patients.","I spent a week in Morocco with two friends in 2019. When we first walked around Casablanca, I felt unprepared for the extreme cultural transition. However, my perception changed when we visited the Hassan II Mosque. Our tour guide, a Casablanca local, enlightened us to the importance of the Mosque for the Sunni people. After our tour, we sat outside near a group of women and children playing. Several times, children came over with balls and wanted to play with us. The children laughed with us, and the women smiled at us. I felt grateful to be exactly where I was. As I learned more about the Islamic religion and Moroccan culture, both during our travels and after, I began to appreciate its complexity, tradition, and values. I learned the importance of understanding another culture before forming judgments about it. I minored in history to learn about the history and culture of Islam and continue to grow past my stereotypes and cultural lens to consider other cultures more thoughtfully.","When I worked at a nursing home during the Covid-19 pandemic, I witnessed the mental harm of social isolation. Patients were unable to visit with families or leave their rooms. I was one of only a few faces they saw each day. While this sometimes felt like a lot of responsibility, I felt privileged to be trusted by them for their care. One patient, ‚ÄúMarcy,‚Äù had severe dementia and rolled down the hall in her wheelchair, talking to herself and staring ahead in a daze. On one rare sunny day in Bellingham, Washington, I rolled Marcy outside into the sun. She didn‚Äôt answer whether she wanted to stay outside or not, so I put sunscreen on her face and went inside. When I checked on her, Marcy had tilted her face upward toward the sun with a slight smile and eyes closed. I was overjoyed that I could provide her with a brief respite from the nursing home hallway. Small moments like these motivate me to continue helping others find wellness and support, particularly as they age. ",,,1,"During the pandemic, I served urban and rural members of my community by performing Covid-19 testing. While not true for all individuals living in rural areas, I found that many of the rural patients I served held different views than myself regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. I valued the opportunity to listen and connect during these interactions and learned that my rural upbringing prepared me for these conversations. I had practice speaking with my parents about the pandemic, opening my mind to their perspective and providing the background science to help them understand mine. While the Covid-19 pandemic has brought substantial hardship, I‚Äôm grateful for the experience of talking with my family and patients about it, because as a physician I will serve patients who have different backgrounds and views from me.",1,1,2

I wanted to reassure her, but I wasn’t sure how. All I could do was squeeze her hand and say “I’m here”. Though I had seen medicine cure patients from illness, this hopelessness and lack of energy to continue was something that I could not fix. Two weeks later, Millie died of COVID. As a dialysis tech, I have learned the importance of walking with patients through their healthcare journeys, even if there is no simple resolution. My role was not to fix the problem, but rather to help, to make her feel cared for, and to support her. Similarly, the role of a physician goes far beyond medicine and science. I seek to be a physician who takes the time to get to know my patients and walks with them on their health journey.
        	My commitment to becoming a compassionate physician evolved over many years, with two main driving forces. I have always loved science as it feeds my knowledge, allowing my curiosity to persist. Secondly, I knew I wanted a career that would positively impact society. I fell in love with volunteering in high school, and caring for people in need was a necessity when choosing a career path. Throughout college, I was involved in a service organization, Alpha Phi Omega. I was able to grow that love for volunteering, for giving back to my community in any possible way. The sense of fulfillment this gave me kept me grounded throughout the stressors of college. Upon graduating college, I had taken all of my pre-med classes, researched endlessly about the medical profession, and volunteered for various health organizations. However, I wanted to gain a greater handle on the day to day life of a physician. Thus, I decided to take 2 gap years to further explore by working various jobs. 
          As I reflect on why I want to be a physician, I think about the amazing providers I’ve gotten to work with and learn from. I think about the orthopedic surgeons I currently work with, going the extra mile for every patient. I admire their selflessness, willing to do whatever it takes to provide the best care. I think about the physician willing to pay for an Uber to get her patient to their scheduled treatment. I think about the trauma surgeon, who runs a very hectic clinic, and I admire her always being a team player. One Friday, after the staff had been overwhelmed and overworked, I decided to seek an alternate solution. I suggested switching some clinic placements for a better balance, and it was decided that we would try my idea. The physicians appreciated the efficiency and it ultimately allowed the office to run smoother. The opportunity to apply my problem-solving skills in the context of patient encounters is another aspect that draws me to medicine.
 	My desire to pursue medicine has grown over time and continued to motivate me to move forward. Working directly with patients has allowed me to learn how to use emotional intelligence to determine the best approach—whether the patient needs support, a listening ear, or advice. I have seen admirable physicians work directly with patients throughout their medical journeys, helping to encourage and aid them at every step. The look of relief when a patient’s pain is alleviated, or the grateful smile when they feel that their concerns were listened to and their feelings were validating inspires me each day to continue on this path.","Growing up in a predominantly white, Christian, middle class community, diversity was not something I knew much about. Once I started working, I watched my best friend experience racism in the workplace, and I promised myself to always educate myself on these issues. This was taken to a new level when I studied abroad in Chile. I learned what it was like to be a minority, and experienced prejudice/stereotypes, with the luxury of it not being permanent. I can candidly say this was one of the hardest experiences, and oftentimes found myself in uncomfortable situations. Now, I continually incorporate these experiences into my patient care. I was casting a very frightened 4 year old, recently immigrated from Honduras. While everyone was annoyed at the screaming, I pointed out how scary it must be to be in pain and not understand anything the people around you are saying. My experiences and personal traits push me to work at creating a healthcare system that values diversity and inclusion.","In college I decided to take a course with a service learning project, Human Genetics. For this project, we worked with the organization Urban Dreams, a nonprofit working for equal opportunity and access to people in the Des Moines community. They provide Des Moines‚Äô inner city with ‚Äúa wide range of human service programs that break down barriers for underserved and underrepresented populations.‚Äù We collaborated with the directors to develop a health survey to help them gather health information on the community they were serving, then went to Urban Dreams throughout the semester to administer the survey. Once we had enough data, we compiled all of the answers and helped to analyze the information we received. This service analysis changed the way they delivered health related services, allowing them to better and more efficiently serve the community. I hope to do projects like this in medical school, using my knowledge for the good of my community. ",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted my preparation for medical school in many different ways. I would have loved to shadow a variety of different specialties to help better understand myself in medicine. Volunteering is also a huge part of my life, and I believe experiencing it in the hospital setting would have been wonderful for myself and my preparation. Furthermore, the pandemic has affected my planning and preparation for the MCAT and applications on a more personal level. Like most people, it affected my mental health and I felt as though my life was on pause. I saw on a personal level how it affected my relationships, as well as the severe impact on my community. I was very lucky to be able to stay in my apartment and keep my job, but working throughout the pandemic was grueling. Listening to physicians, I realized how this has exposed the harsh, and oftentimes dangerous, realities of medicine.

Spending time with my family is medicinal for me, something I wish everybody could have. I was taught to always be kind and compassionate towards others, whether it was shoveling our neighbor’s driveway during the brutal New England blizzards, smiling at someone who looks sad, or volunteering at food pantries.

Having volunteered at Hope 7 Food Pantry in Troy, NY through my service fraternity in college, I am acutely aware of the effects that food insecurity can have on a family. Food insecurity has peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic, a situation that has been exacerbated by the inability of food pantries to sustain themselves with increased demands. To help, I co-founded a nonprofit, Healthy KITchen, which provides nutritious meal kits to the local Boston community. My days after work are spent constructing meal kits and distributing them at partnering food pantries. As I distributed meals, it became increasingly evident how strong social insecurity is linked to mental and physical health. One night, Hunter, a single father of four, came to the pantry with a look of despair on his face marked with skin lesions that were a result of his liver disease. His son was suffering from Marasmus, a disease caused by severe malnutrition. After hearing this news, I became frustrated that the best I could do in that moment was hand him a meal kit and say, “I’m so sorry to hear that.” Witnessing firsthand the devastating effects that food insecurity and inadequate nutrition can have on family health and more specifically children’s health at the very beginning of life, I wasn’t satisfied with my service; I wanted to treat patients directly.

Eager to better understand the direct role of medical professionals in treating children’s disease, I began shadowing Dr. Paul Lerou, the Division Chief of Neonatology and Newborn Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) rounds. Parents would occasionally join rounds, many with bags under their eyes, looking like they hadn’t slept in days. One couple, whose baby was suffering from a severe congenital lung disease, was noticeably despondent, as they had been informed that their baby was coughing up blood. The physical and emotional strain that illness had on the family was palpable as their baby was being taken to the operating room. A week after the operation, Dr. Lerou announced that their baby’s condition was improving. The mother breathed a sigh of relief and hugged her husband tightly – it was as if Dr. Lerou’s optimistic words healed the family in seemingly bleak circumstances. The value of being a physician became clear to me and I fell more in love with the role: leadership, service, and compassion.

As my shadowing experience solidified my interest in medicine, I aspired to understand why lung disease was so prevalent in newborns. After graduation, I joined the Pediatric Surgical Research Labs of Drs. Patricia K. Donahoe and Xingbin Ai at MGH, where I was able to integrate clinical and research duties. I have spent two years investigating Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, a congenital lung disease, using an innovative, non-invasive method of deriving neonatal lung stem cells from tracheal aspirate samples of intubated newborns. This manuscript is currently under review at Science Translational Medicine, where I am a co-first author. As some CDH patients also have known genetic mutations, my other project focuses on characterizing the lung specific role of a CDH associated genetic variant in the ZFHX4 gene. As part of my clinical duties, I recruit patients into the tracheal aspirate collection study and perform consents. A few weeks into the job, I visited the NICU to speak to the parents of a 25-week-old premature baby about our research. I could only imagine the devastation the parents must have felt to see their baby in critical condition with a dozen tubes sticking out of him, stripping away from them the beautiful moments that parents are supposed to share with their child upon birth. Nonetheless, I was impressed by the intricate personal care demonstrated by the medical team for a patient only the size of my forearm. A few months later in the NICU, I ran into the same family who approached me with exuberance. “Look how chubby he is now!” the mother exclaimed, pointing to her baby. It filled me with joy to see the baby’s health improving; the agony of being separated from her baby at birth was finally relieved. The loving look on the mother’s face as she lifted the baby into her arms is what draws me to medicine – the ability to heal not only a person but also their family. 

At an early age, I was taught by my family to always help others and treat everybody with kindness. These lessons encouraged me to pursue numerous scientific and social service projects throughout my life. As a physician, I will strive to serve the community and heal fractured families, so they can have a chance to spend the next special occasion together as one.","Running my nonprofit, Healthy KITchen, has been extremely challenging. After reaping the benefits of eating a high fat and protein diet, I was inspired to provide the food-insecure communities with high quality food during the dire time of the pandemic. As Co-Founder of Healthy KITchen, my role is to manage meal kit distribution, tax paperwork, volunteer activity, corporate partnerships, and market research for new meal ideas. After struggling with finding a balance between food quality and price, we were able to bring our costs down to $2.50 per kit, providing over 1000 meals across my and my partners‚Äô states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Wisconsin._x000D_
_x000D_
Converting my frustration over the pandemic into something that has helped my community has been incredibly rewarding. Food insecurity is only one example of the serious flaws in healthcare that exist outside of the hospital. I want to use my power and resources as a physician to fight food insecurity as I proceed in my career.","I initially pursued a position as a Kumon tutor to pay for my textbook expenses. During the summer of my first year of college, I noticed that ‚ÄúRohit,‚Äù a junior in high school, was struggling with the curriculum. I got to know Rohit as a brilliant kid from an impoverished background. His family relied on food stamps and didn‚Äôt have money to buy new clothes. Rohit was beginning to think he was not meant to go to college, and was considering dropping out of high school entirely._x000D_
_x000D_
Rohit‚Äôs story resonated with me, as I run a nonprofit to help the food insecure. I made it my mission to help him improve in algebra. I set up separate one-on-one meetings to diagnose the pre-algebra competencies he was missing and worked through custom lesson plans with him. Helping Rohit pass Algebra with a B+ is my proudest achievement as a Kumon tutor. Tutoring helped me discover an intense love of mentorship and education, and I want to carry this passion both into my class at Rush and into physicianship.",,,1,"I was not prepared for the frustration, anger, and fear in my family when my mother was furloughed from her banking job due to the pandemic.

_x000D_
We had to learn to process that stress and fear in a way that didn't tear the three of us apart. I challenged myself to re-frame hurtful and angry words from two of the people I love the most.

As the son of two Latino primary care doctors, my medical 'education' began early. The honest look into the inspiring and heartbreaking challenges of being a physician combined with my Latino background has shaped the doctor I want to become, one who will speak to patients in their native language and build immediate trust through understanding a shared heritage. My dad was born in Mexico and immigrated to the U.S. when he was three years old. He established and runs the Clinica Latina at the Santa Rosa, CA Kaiser, where he primarily sees Spanish-speaking patients. My mom’s heritage is Mexican and Nicaraguan. She specialized in women's health as an OBGYN. Seeing my parents' impact has given me hope that I, too, can become the third Dr. Garcia, adding to the growing pool of Latin American doctors. I yearn to make the same connections and difference they have made in their communities.
 
The peak experiences of my undergrad years were my trips with Medical Brigades to Ghana and Panama. Working with Dr. Jonah in the temporary one-week Ghanaian clinic was awe-inspiring. He instantly became my hero. I was amazed by his poise in all the surrounding chaos of the crush of people who had perhaps never seen a doctor before. Dr. Jonah had no resources, no fancy equipment, and few medicines, yet he was able to show me how to treat each patient as if they were the only one there - the feeling of giving the patient his undivided attention. So inspiring. It was also my first opportunity to provide direct care to patients, which was energizing and left me craving more. It became clear that nothing else would satisfy me more than to become a doctor. The patients' unique experiences reinforced my belief that healthcare looks different for everyone and should be tailored accordingly for each person. In other words, it's crucial to have a cultural-centered approach when providing health resources.
 
As soon as I completed my Bachelor’s degree, where my minor in Biomedical Ethics was the highlight, I immediately became an EMT to practice medicine. As part of a team, I lead patient assessments and analyze information. Building that rapport and making patients comfortable on what could be the worst day of their lives is highly gratifying. In an emergency, I'm at my best: time is of the essence, direct yet thoughtful communication, quick thinking, assessment, and always learning more.  I love processing tons of information and coming up with an optimal course of care in my role as an EMT. 
 
Being an EMT is gratifying in another way because it calls on me to interact with various populations. Besides the occasional trauma situation, about 99% of the calls in our community are either for homeless cases – specifically addictions and overdoses, uninsured -- or helping the elderly.  I come face to face with ethical dilemmas that continue to reinforce my desire to improve individuals’ health. My past volunteering with unsheltered individuals while at the University of  San Diego helped open my eyes and expand my perspective. In talking with the participants, I realized that non-judgemental conversations help you see the person behind the label, the human being behind the circumstance. Doing one's best not to judge why people are having issues has helped me do my best work every day with an open mind. 
 
A person's mental and physical health are inextricably intertwined. My maternal grandfather passed away from alcoholism when I was 14. He was a Harvard graduate and brilliant Chicano Studies professor who, by the end of his life, was defined by his alcoholism, a sad truth that overshadowed his many accomplishments. His addiction was a formative experience that shaped my outlook on medicine and the physician's role. Many saw his struggle with addiction as a character flaw. This stigma made it difficult to get him the support and treatment he needed. Doctors have an essential role in educating and breaking down stereotypes, supporting patients and their families, and caring for individuals holistically. Beyond this, it's vital to acknowledge that mental health affects everyone of all backgrounds and achievement levels.
 
I love cooking and have many memories of making traditional Latin dishes with my family. Nutritious food was a must in our home. I hope to combine this emphasis with the information I am learning from my Integrative Nutrition certificate to inspire people to make beneficial choices for their health and wellbeing. I'm passionate about food and the social power of bringing people together, and how food can be used as medicine. I hope to get people as excited about food and nutrition as I am.
 
I'm bringing all of myself towards the challenges of providing effective and caring medicine in my future as a doctor. My upbringing, Latino heritage, and life experiences propel me toward a career in medicine, caring for vulnerable communities. People are complex, and their health needs to reflect that. I plan to combine all of the skills and lessons I've learned thus far with continuous learning about the human side of medicine to provide people with the healthcare they deserve.","While serving pancakes in the community, I talked to one guy who had a string of bad luck, starting with losing his job and his sister getting sick at the same time. He was living out of his car and wanted to do better. It was inspiring to hear him say that this was only a temporary solution as he tried to seek out the services he needed. He was frustrated yet determined to turn his luck around. _x000D_
_x000D_
He gave me great insight into what life on the streets is like and how a few violent/addicted people ruin the image of all homeless people. He said that many homeless women are raped or beaten up by homeless men daily, most of which are unreported to the police and go untreated. It was heartbreaking to hear him express the victims‚Äô helplessness. And tragic to learn that much of the time, they would succumb to their untreated wounds. This sickened me. Better access to health care could prevent this unnecessary outcome. This stuck with me and changed my perspective on the homeless population. _x000D_
","As a contact tracer, I witnessed how the large Latino population in Sonoma County was disproportionately affected by COVID. Despite this, the service announcements offered in Spanish by Public Health were severely lacking. A prime example was the text message we would send when we couldn‚Äôt get ahold of someone. It was all in English, and then at the end of the long paragraph, it said, ‚ÄúEnter 2 for Spanish‚Äù. This was unacceptable. It made Latino patients seem like an afterthought. I imagine this would discourage this population from following up with us, which is unfortunate as they needed the help. I sent an email to my bosses saying either there needs to be a Spanish version or the Spanish option needs to be moved to the top. They responded by creating a Spanish text that we could send, allowing for the inclusion of the often forgotten 26.5% of our population in this county. It felt great to see my solution come to improve access for my fellow Latinos. _x000D_

Also, COVID canceled the Scripps trauma internship, where I could shadow ER physicians in a level 1 trauma center. Additionally, I was looking forward to my third Medical Brigade trip, unique in that we would have treated refugees in the camps located in Greece. _x000D_

COVID was not all bad. It brought out the need for contact tracers, so I applied to work as one with my local public health department. Additionally, I participated in virtual tutoring, a marvelous way to connect with youth in a time when we were distanced. I am lucky and thankful that I wasn‚Äôt affected healthwise by COVID. _x000D_

2023,15297831,,45,Woman,USA,0,,0,0,,U,0,1,"Twenty-two years ago, in the spring of 2000, I plagiarized a paragraph of text on an essay. I was running out of time to submit the essay for a class that I had deprioritized in favor of writing my undergraduate thesis. The violation was obvious and in a meeting with the professor and the dean, I received the punishment of a failing grade in the class and a one-year hold on my diploma. This disrupted my post-graduate plans considerably and led to much soul-searching about how I could reach such a low point in my previously unblemished academic life. More than two decades later I can call up these feelings of shame and regret easily.

I believe I emerged from this episode a better student and a more compassionate person. First, I learned to overcome my natural timidity and reach out to my instructors for help when I was struggling in a class. Second, I took responsibility for my terrible decision and lived with the consequences of getting an F in a class and not graduating on time. Third, I learned to forgive myself and move forward, eventually earning three other degrees with zero academic integrity issues.

I am a palliative care nurse practitioner embedded in an oncology clinic. It is my job to facilitate tough conversations. Yet the thought of having to tell Ann that she was dying after caring for her for years was devastating. Her oncologist, Dr. V., and I lingered outside the exam room before entering together, knowing what was about to happen. We sat down with Ann and ""Jim,"" her husband, who had been by her side throughout her arduous treatments.

I started by asking Ann how she was doing. She shared her concerns about emerging symptoms and asked what they meant. Why were her legs stubbornly swollen and not responding to diuretics? Why were the whites of her eyes gradually turning yellow? Why was she becoming increasingly fatigued? Dr. V. explained calmly. Then Ann asked us point-blank: how long? The question hung in the air. Dr. V. paused for a moment before slowly saying, ""I think a few weeks, maybe a month.""

Seconds felt like hours as we sat together in the dense silence of realization. In palliative care we call this ""bearing witness,"" because all one can do in a moment like this is to try to meet the patient where they are, silently acknowledging an unfathomable reality.

The visit ultimately ended the way many of our encounters do in the oncology clinic--with a discussion about Ann's hopes and fears. Dr. V., leading the conversation, masterfully kept the focus on what we could do at that point to relieve Ann's symptoms. After Dr. V. left to attend to other patients, I spent a long time with Ann and Jim, helping them process this difficult prognosis. I explored with them how they could break the news to their young daughters and extended family. Finally, I explained that hospice care could help Ann stay comfortable at home, minimizing the need for repeated trips to the hospital.

Conversations like this stay with me--not only because they are emotionally fraught--but also because they reveal how relational medicine can be. As a nurse I learned how to care for patients at the bedside, an experience I will forever cherish. As a nurse practitioner I learned how to build rapport with patients and support them through some of the most difficult moments in their lives. There was no single moment when I decided to pursue medicine--my interest evolved organically and gradually through caring for patients living with serious illness as well as working alongside patient-centered physicians like Dr. V.

Patients like Ann, who had the audacity to live well in the face of terminal illness, inspire me daily to learn and grow as much as I can in order to help patients make sense of their illness experiences. I now seek a deeper understanding of the ""why"" behind the pathology I see every day, down to the molecular level, so that I can, in turn, use this knowledge to empower patients to make informed decisions about their health.

Physicians such as Dr. V. inspire me by bringing their humanity to every patient encounter, listening carefully, responding thoughtfully, and acting with resolve. The strength of the patient-physician relationship can be the deciding factor in whether someone skeptical of Western medicine decides to trust their oncologist's expertise and accept a standard of care treatment that has the best chance of prolonging their life. It can also determine whether someone who is desperate to live at all costs can, with enduring guidance from their primary care physician, realistically accept that they are nearing the end of their disease trajectory. In observing my physician mentors' meticulous attention to patient needs and their persistence in fulfilling those needs, I recognize my own aspirations to medicine.

Working with seriously ill patients throughout my nursing career, both in geriatrics and oncology, has crystallized my calling to serve this population. What shape this takes after medical school is yet to be determined. I am most interested in the intersection of primary care and psychiatry, as improving health among the seriously ill requires a multidimensional approach: physical, mental, and social determinants of health must be addressed. As a physician I hope to lead inter-professional health care teams where all of these domains are represented.

Like Dr. V. compassionately breaking bad news to Ann and Jim, I want to be that trusted and expert guide who understands the disease process at the deepest level, walking alongside patients and families, keeping watch over their health, and leading the health care team through whatever challenges arise. I want to listen deeply to patients' priorities through countless conversations so we can decide together how to proceed when times are tough. Above all, I want patients to feel that I have truly cared for and about them. I know the path ahead in medicine will be lengthy and challenging. I also know how painful it is to lose a patient suddenly, as well as the unexpected joy of seeing a patient with metastatic cancer have an excellent response to treatment. In pursuing medicine I choose to lean into the long hours, the tough decisions, the joys of healing, and the sorrows of loss.","Danny was a young Latino man who had lost his dishwashing job during the pandemic and was unable to find work. He was behind on his rent and was worried about becoming homeless. He was spending most of his day staying inside and drinking alcohol, not talking with anyone, withdrawing from friends and family.

As a volunteer crisis counselor for 988/Lifeline, I took Danny's call that night. Though I could not solve all of Danny's problems, I could provide empathic emotional support and help him identify ways to stay safe from suicide. I connected him with Alcoholics Anonymous and a free mental health clinic for therapy. Calls like this one bring into sharp relief the disparate ways in which the pandemic has economically and socially crushed a population already vulnerable to economic insecurity and racial injustice. Callers like Danny inspire me to serve the community as much as I can since the needs are so great.","In my work as an outpatient palliative care provider, I try to address the primary care needs of some of our underinsured patients within the limits of my training. Julio was a 50 year old man with metastatic cancer who presented to clinic with left scrotal pain and dysuria. He had Medicaid insurance, but it only covered oncologic care in our clinic. After work-up revealed chlamydia causing acute epididymitis, we realized that per CDC guidelines, we needed to give Julio an intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone plus oral antibiotics, but his insurance would not cover the injection in our clinic or any of the primary care clinics in our system. I did not want to send Julio to the ED to get a single dose of a cheap, generic antibiotic, so I conferred with my supervising physician. We decided to give the dose ourselves at Julio's visit--and the clinic pharmacy donated the dose (~90 cents). We were glad that Julio did not have to go to the ED for a single shot due to insurance reasons.",,,1,"My post-bacc program moved to remote live learning, which made it challenging to engage with professors.

As a palliative care nurse practitioner I worked throughout the pandemic seeing oncology patients as they came in for chemotherapy infusions. Goals of care conversations took on special urgency. We proactively talked with patients about how aggressively we should treat a severe COVID-19-related illness based on their preferences about using life support. I also had to advise patients that dying in the hospital could mean dying alone due to strict visitation restrictions. Many patients were adamant about not wanting to die in the hospital under these circumstances. To honor these preferences I worked alongside our team to minimize hospitalizations and ensure that patients who wanted it were able to have in-home hospice care at the end of life.",1,1,1

To me, good care takes into account the whole person and their changing needs. It is scientifically sound, and works around institutional barriers in order to tend to a patient in their real-world context. As a volunteer community health care worker at the Berkeley Free Clinic, I have been providing essential preventative care to low-income patients in the East Bay for two years. This fulfilling work has allowed me to provide holistic care to my community while combining my love of biology and community connection. In addition to my clinical work, my family’s personal medical experiences have taught me that health is about more than pathology, and that evidence-based, radically inclusive care is lifesaving. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue to impact others’ lives in the best way I know how—with my hands and heart in the medical field.
Growing up with two physician parents has taught first hand me that being a physician is an intense commitment. As a child I breastfed, played, and grew up in on-call rooms. Some of my strongest childhood memories are of my parents caring for me when I got sick. Their kitchen table discussions—about which antibiotic to prescribe, whether or not I needed an x-ray following a bike crash, or if they needed a third consult with one of their colleagues—not only actively included me (“What do you think, Sahra?”), but also gave me valuable opportunities to ask questions and learn about my health. This was the first place I learned, through their example, that my own thoughts about my health were valued, and that patients deserve to be explicitly involved with their own care and treatment plans.
Helping two of my siblings through health crises of their own reinforced the importance of holistic, patient-centered care in my world. My younger brother was recently treated for epiglottitis and this life threatening infection rocked my family’s world. I’ve never seen my parents so stressed, but the physicians that my dad interacted with at the hospital were calm and kind; they cared for my family when we desperately needed them. Later, when we learned about this infection in EMT school, I was struck by how empowering this knowledge was—without my parents’ quick thinking and the technical know-how of the physicians and nurses in the emergency room, my little brother would have died. Another sibling has faced different struggles related to gender identity and their experiences at school. Watching this sibling’s gender identity be questioned, disparaged, and mocked in school (leaving them afraid to go to kindergarten) has bolstered my belief that all aspects of a patient’s health are important and worthy of attention. In helping them navigate the school system, I have found that the inclusive care and compassion provided by educational professionals has improved my sibling’s lived experience as a genderqueer person and positively impacted their health. Just as technical knowledge of disease saved one brother's life, the inclusive care my other sibling received was also instrumental in shaping their health outcomes. This experience, coupled with my work experience at the Berkeley Free Clinic, has reified my belief that inclusive and equitable care saves lives  
The Berkeley Free Clinic’s philosophy revolves around the idea that health care and health knowledge should be free and accessible to all, and that the homeless, undocumented, low income, and queer communities, as well as communities of color who we serve deserve exceptional care where they feel safe and comfortable. I was recently able to provide this accessible care during a routine tuberculosis screening for a patient. The blood test came up positive, and the patient needed to be connected to a sputum test and physician to determine if she had latent TB. This proved quite challenging because, like many during the pandemic, she was recently laid off, without health insurance, and living in a crowded household. The care plan I crafted for this patient included sliding scale referrals, signing her up for state insurance, and a follow-up timeline. Being able to tangibly help this patient and ensure she wasn’t left behind by a quickly moving, profit-based health care system was fulfilling and gave me hope. The future of health care does not have to be bleak—there are good people who care deeply about the people they help everywhere. After working in the clinic for two years, I am impassioned to continue providing care to underserved populations, and I hope to use my power and autonomy as a physician to give people the best compassionate, evidence-based care possible.
I’ve learned firsthand that interactions with doctors can be life changing. What is likely a small, routine moment for a doctor can be a deeply impactful encounter that a patient remembers forever. This is both the burden and blessing of being a physician—you are always short on time but never on responsibility or impact. Due to my time providing thoughtful, affirming, and scientifically-sound collaborative care at the Berkeley Free Clinic, as well as my personal experiences of caring for my brothers, I believe I would be a positive part of a patient's health journey and an empathetic and informed physician.","Across age, sexuality, gender, ethnicity, and life experience I‚Äôve been able to effectively build rapport with each and every patient I see to provide more effective and personable STI health information. One example of this is when a transgender and polyamorous woman came in for an STI panel. This patient had previously avoided getting screened because visiting the doctor was extremely uncomfortable for her; she was often subject to unnecessary and invasive questioning, misgendering, and awkward fumbling as providers figured out how to deal with a trans person practicing a non-monogamous relationship structure. By making this patient comfortable she was able to ask every question on her mind, have needs outside of the STI panel met, and was enthusiastic about returning for frequent screening. I learned from this encounter that rapport building is a valuable tool for providing patient care across populations.","I have volunteered hundreds of hours to provide healthcare with a team of diverse healthcare professionals in an urban setting, the Bay Area, for the past two years. In my time at the Clinic I have pushed for more comprehensive Mgen and Hepatitis testing, more inclusive language for patient care, and updated HIV care referrals. This persistence in pursuing the best care possible for our patients shows that I prioritize clinical excellence for all. Being a healthcare professional in this particular geographic location has made me especially sensitive to the needs of the unhoused, undocumented, and queer communities of color I interact with every day. These groups have been the primary focus of the advocacy work I do in the East Bay and I plan to continue emphasizing healthcare equity and access in my medical career.",,,1,"Throughout the pandemic, community need for preventive care increased. When people were unable to see their physicians for regular appointments they still needed PPE supplies, TB tests, and flu shots. I continued to work at the Berkeley Free Clinic during the pandemic and was able to provide these resources. Our tuberculosis (TB) testing shifted entirely to telehealth; I became very comfortable navigating digital appointments and outside lab testing. When I had a patient test positive for TB via a blood test I needed to connect her to a physician for further care. This proved quite challenging because, like many during the pandemic, she was recently laid off, without health insurance, and living in a crowded household. The care plan I crafted for this patient included sliding scale referrals, signing her up for state insurance, and a follow-up timeline. During the pandemic I was still actively serving my community‚Äôs healthcare needs.",1,0,2

The charge nurse during my shift asked if one of the volunteers would assist in serving a patient their meal. Amongst the silent crowd, my hand bolted up and I picked up the meal tray before walking over to the patient’s room. I knocked and entered with a smile as I put the tray down and revealed a display of bow tie pasta. As I sat down and began cutting each pasta piece into two even triangles before serving it to Len, I couldn’t help but comment on the golf channel on the TV while we were chatting. Len’s face immediately lit up as he delved into how much he loved to play before his illness. We quickly bonded over his most memorable hole-in-ones to long drives and risky bunker shots. He was an avid PGA follower and lived for the miles of grassy fairways. I spent the next few days pondering whether Len would ever return to the sport he so dearly loved. I felt for his situation and was happy to have been able to comfort him during a time of physical distress through the game of golf. This was a lasting interaction which first sparked my aspiration of becoming a physician grounded in compassion and shared experiences. 
          My passion for volunteering and interacting with others led me abroad to Ecuador on a medical service trip. Between triaging patients, teaching children how to brush their teeth during my dental rotation, and observing Pap smears, I immersed myself into a variety of healthcare roles. I distinctly remember during my shift at the OB/GYN clinic, our first patient was a middle-aged woman who came in visibly distressed and anxious about her visit. I recalled the stigmas around women’s health within many South American rural communities I researched, such as their spouses often dismissing the importance of these preventative measures. When I led our first patient to the examination room, I greeted her warmly in hopes to ease her nervousness of the novel environment. The OB/GYN carefully talked through treatment regimens and thoughtfully answered her questions before proceeding with her examination. I was relieved at how the patient felt more at ease once she met the physician, who took her time getting to know her patient.  
          I was in awe of the role of the physician after observing how these women were receptive to such life-saving examinations. It truly would not have been possible without the physician’s patience and awareness of cultural barriers, which really made their responsibilities stand out to me. There was no one formula that the physician followed when seeing each patient by the way she prioritized listening to their concerns. The rawness I witnessed in the examination rooms and the role I had in improving the lives of patients were lasting sentiments that made me even more proud to have been a part of this team. I left Ecuador excited and inspired as I knew I wanted to dedicate a lifetime of responsibility towards diagnosing and serving others through healing. 
          Community service has constantly been an important part of my identity and it was through acts of service that I discovered my desire to become a physician. My role as a volunteer in the hospital taught me the importance of interpersonal connections in the physician-patient relationship. Further, working in the mobile clinic taught me about the various roles a physician must take on to provide empathetic and lasting care for their patients. Even now, my observations in the oncology clinic at the National Institutes of Health put a smile on my face under my mask as the physicians naturally intertwine personal conversations with their patients’ scheduled visits. My passion for service, particularly within underrepresented minority groups, has led me to currently serve my local Washington D.C. community as a tutor for low-income elementary school students outside of my day job researching biological differences between races in prostate cancer. 
          I often envision my own future conversations with my patients and am motivated by the thought of serving as their primary advocate for their health. There is no greater act of service that I can see for myself other than the role of a physician, who has the highest responsibility of fighting for a patient’s life. My service-oriented background continues to motivate my desires to comfort and heal others through the power of medicine. I believe that lasting treatment is grounded in prioritizing open dialogue and shared human experiences. The countless interactions with diverse individuals I’ve had along my journey to physician-hood not only leave memorable conversations, but also valuable experiences that I will bring with me as I move forward. It is because of these interpersonal relationships that I feel committed towards diagnosing and treating future patients by serving as a bridge between medicine and individualized care.","When I volunteered in Ecuador with medical clinics, I recognized how drastically underserved rural populations were as I could see the relief that many of these patients felt to receive long-awaited care by the physicians. I also became aware of the cultural stigmas surrounding preventative care as the physicians empathetically navigated these conversations with their patients. Being immersed in the rural communities of Ecuador strengthened my understanding of the cultural and socioeconomic barriers that are vital for enhancing patient-centered care to eliminate healthcare disparities. I hope to participate in global health initiatives throughout my medical training by continuing community outreach and keeping these issues in active conversation to encourage positive changes. In particular, I look forward to participating in the many clinics that care for underserved populations in the Chicago area to continue educating myself on how to better serve these communities. _x000D_
","At the beginning of the pandemic, I was inspired to support my local communities through virtual tutoring for students from low-income households as I recognized the challenges of social distancing learning. My love for working with children motivated me to come up with engaging ways to teach my students as I recognized their learning environments were oftentimes distracting and had limited resources. Not only did I get to help each of my students improve academically, but I was excited by how diversifying learning approaches inspired them to enjoy learning rather than fear it. The patience and communication I showed my students is what I intend to draw from as a future physician committed to demystifying medicine within underserved communities. I hope to participate in similar opportunities at Rush Medical College such as the Buddies program and the RCSIP youth advocates program to continue empowering younger generations. _x000D_
",,,1,"After graduating, my desire to gain more clinical and research exposure before applying to medical programs led me to a research fellow position at the National Institutes of Health. My research interest in health disparities inspired me to pilot several projects on the genomics of race in prostate cancer which I look forward to progressing until my matriculation in 2023. The pandemic set back my productivity as our laboratory was operating as partially remote for the majority of 2020 and into 2021. Further, the effects of social distancing within the clinical centers limited the number of shadowing hours I was able to achieve as well as opportunities for in-person community outreach. In lieu of this, I have been volunteering as a virtual tutor and also educating my community as a blood donor ambassador for the American Red Cross since 2020. Further, I plan to continue these extracurricular endeavors throughout the next year.",1,0,2

Throughout high school I played guitar and saxophone and after graduating, I was recruited into several rock bands and quickly became the primary composer for these groups. Our bands published several albums and were doing quite well financially with royalties and booked venues. But life on the stage ended when our trailer was stolen the night before leaving for a nationwide tour. Under the cover of darkness, all of our instruments and gear were taken. Life had taken a turn for the worst. 
Oh, woe is me!

As if that wasn’t enough of a harbinger, fate chose once again to intervene soon after we had replaced our belongings. 
While laying down a new hit at our favorite music studio, a rooftop maintenance man accidentally dropped a cigarette into the building’s insulation and the entire place ignited. My bandmates and I each scrambled out, coughing and wheezing, as we watched the local firemen spray destructive foam all over our favorite instruments and recording equipment. Our dreams truly went up in smoke that day.

I decided then, that such a lifestyle wasn’t sustainable. I love music, but I felt I needed to do something more meaningful with my time on Earth. I decided to travel abroad, not only to practice and learn more Spanish, but to experience another culture and to perhaps gain some much needed clarity. So a solo ticket to Buenos Aires was bought and I climbed aboard an overnight flight to Argentina.
 
We have a tendency, I suppose, before a vacation to expect smiling faces, cleanliness, rays of sunshine, and a general pleasantness at our destination. Right? 

What I saw after hailing a cab from Ezeiza International Airport left me speechless.

As I peered out the window of my taxi along the route to the hostel, at the sidewalks and byways, I noticed some things I'll never forget. What I saw were not just the homeless collecting scraps of cardboard for recycling, but families garbed in patchwork fabric sitting outside of buildings begging from those entering and leaving. I witnessed genuine “shanty towns”, neighborhoods composed of corrugated roofing panels with dirt floors and wandering stray animals. Barefoot, shirtless children approaching vehicles at the interim between red and green lights with dirty outstretched hands and elderly people ravaged by disease attempting to climb onto over-crowded buses.

I left the airport with a grin of positive expectation, and left my cab with a sunken heart. 
The wind was taken out of my sails.

My interest in medicine was truly cemented after witnessing these conditions in parts of South America. The countries there are beautiful, but they also have levels of poverty we frankly do not see here in the United States. We have our problems, but they are worse elsewhere. There is much greatness in the world but also much darkness swept into its corners.

Seeing the disparity in healthcare between these countries and our own helped me to recognize what an important role that medicine and public health play in a community. It made me appreciate what we have, and made me want to contribute.

Perhaps it is hubris, but my interest in medicine is simply a desire to serve. To pitch in and make a difference. This may sound cliché, but we all need to do something significant with our lives. Over the past year I've endured the untimely death of a very close friend, and watched my grandparents fall victim to dementia and physical disability. I sincerely wish there were more I could do for them or could have done for him.

It was in this spirit that I elected to enroll in an accelerated EMT course and began working for my county's local ambulance service earlier this year. I have since seen some grim things, but also experienced some emotions I have never felt. Regardless of what happens in my life, I am certain I will not forget the pulseless, apneic patient my partner and I managed to bring back. His was the first life I had ever saved, and it only bolstered my interest in healthcare.

Medicine seems like the best place for me to do good in the world, and that sentiment is a heartfelt one.

I know that my pathway to this point is not as traditional as some - I did not jump straight into college with a pre-med track like many of my colleagues.  I like to think, however, that some of my unconventional adventures (music, working, marrying outside the country) will give me a fresh perspective on my medical journey and have allowed me to build up a working discipline that will carry me through medical school, residency, and beyond.

My hope is to rise to the occasion and to the high standards of becoming a physician. I believe that medicine is the noblest profession and I eagerly await my turn to contribute.

Thank you for your consideration.","Nine years ago I met a girl in Argentina. Our backgrounds couldn‚Äôt have been further apart. We grew up with different languages, different customs, holidays, diets, the people there even took ‚Äúsiestas‚Äù! I spent much time in the country and soon became familiar with many of these changes. People are people. My spanish improved, and I grew to know and enjoy her family and their part of the world. She and I eventually became engaged and finally married last year. She moved here and is now learning more about our own culture. There are still a great many things we do differently, but we‚Äôve learned to love the asymmetry. I drink coffee in the morning, she drinks yerba mate with a funny straw out of a dried out gourd. I primarily use the Imperial system, she almost exclusively uses the superior metric system. Our relationship wouldn‚Äôt be the same if we came from similar backgrounds, I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing!","RMC's emphasis on supporting and providing for the under-served communities dovetails with what I've come to appreciate through my experiences local and abroad. In my own home state of Florida, there is a disparity in healthcare availability I was not acutely aware of until I began volunteering at a free clinic in a disadvantaged nearby city just this past year. _x000D_
_x000D_
Volunteering here has opened my eyes to some of the public health issues we face in medicine. The patients we see are poor, uninsured, and often have a difficult time navigating our healthcare system. I have a keen interest in serving these segments, and helping facilitate a community-centered education environment, and am curious as to what other roles that doctors can take to help at the population level._x000D_
",,,1,"I feel that I am fortunate. None of my friends or immediate family have died from COVID-19.

As the individuals in society with the knowledge to help the sick and injured, it is the responsibility and duty of providers to serve.

My parents, siblings, and many aunts and uncles work in healthcare: surgeons, anesthesiologists, and pharmacists. I remember many holiday dinners in which my family would share stories about exciting surgeries, rare medical anomalies, and even heart-warming patient encounters. I would just listen in awe, eyes darting back-and-forth, trying to follow the conversation. Despite all of them specializing in different fields, one thing is consistent: everyone exudes passion for the art of medicine and taking care of others. My father would often tell me that going to work never felt like a job because of how fulfilling it was to leave work making patients happy. Naturally, as a teenager, I gravitated toward experiences focused on medicine. Being a twin brother, one also pursuing medicine, I have learned how important individuality is to me. I feel so fortunate to have a family that casts medicine in a positive light, but it’s important that I discover my own reasons for pursuing it.

One of my first eye-opening experiences was when a base runner slid into my brother’s leg during a baseball game. As soon as his leg started looking more swollen and purple, we took him to the doctor’s office. We were approached by a physician, who, after asking my brother what happened, intervened right away. I know my brother was trying to be tough, but I could see that he was worried (twin telepathy). But with the doctor at the bedside, the concerned look on my brother’s face dissipated. After the culture results came back as S. aureus, he debrided the area, made a small incision, and drained out all of the blood. After I got home, I looked up some of the doctor’s words—S. aureus, necrotic tissue, and hematoma—to understand why he did what he did. I tried to apply what I learned in my biology classes to understand how the hematoma and infection even began.
	
As a high schooler, I was intrigued by this experience. In addition to having a wonderful learning opportunity, I learned that medicine isn’t just an interdisciplinary evidence-based science. My brother had a meaningful interaction with the physician who reassured him, provided him with quality service, and guided him on a road toward recovery. Physicians need empathy and compassion, along with an endless intellectual curiosity to treat their patients. As I realized I aspired to embody these characteristics, what was initially a fleeting interest became a dream.

Fast forward two years, my sister told me that there was an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) program at our local fire company. I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to build upon my interest in medicine. I found myself immersed in the didactic lessons and fascinated to learn about human anatomy. When I obtained my certification, I took away more than just my certification and a job opportunity: a wealth of medical knowledge I was so eager to continue growing and applying. 

One of my most memorable experiences in EMS occurred at a gymnastics competition. A 15 year-old girl got on a bar, flipped, and landed on the back of her neck, lying in pain. My fellow EMT and I arrived promptly on the scene. As trained, I performed my trauma assessment. I could see that the patient was scared and crying, asking whether she would be paralyzed. I tried to console her like the physician did to my brother. Despite the uncertainty, I told her she would be okay. As we arrived at the hospital, I was relieved to put her in the great hands of the emergency room (ER) doctors. I was filled with satisfaction. I was able to use my knowledge and training to help someone. However, I left the hospital never knowing whether the patient was able to make a full recovery. I wanted to see the X-ray of her C-spine. I wanted to have the knowledge to understand why she felt lethargic and tingly. I left wanting to do more than help the physician; I desired to help heal, to learn.

As I continued my experiences as a health coach and ER technician at the end of college, I gained a newfound appreciation for the importance of service to the community, especially for low-income and homeless populations. I was able to understand their challenges by conversing with them 1:1. I gained a better perspective on why they had trouble maintaining their weight and why some come into the ER every night. Since obtaining the Eagle Scout rank, I hold myself to a standard of finding innovative ways to improve the lives of my surrounding community. I hope that by becoming a physician, I can continue this life-long goal and exude passion for the vulnerable patients I have had extensive exposure to.

As a child, my vision for becoming a doctor was a distant dream. With more life experiences, I was able to gradually relate to why my family loves being physicians so much. My own, unique reasons have become more refined as I have learned the role of empathy, higher-order thinking, and compassion in crafting a successful physician. Given my clinical experiences and curiosity in medicine, I think I can build a long-lasting profession that I am passionate about passing the knowledge I learn to patients.","My experiences as a weight-loss health coach have broadened my perspective on obesity and allowed me to understand the unique social challenges that many minorities face. ‚ÄúPatty‚Äù was a low-SES black woman who explained to me how hard it was to manage her weight. She worked 6 days a week and had little time to exercise while caring for her family. With my training in nutrition and motivational interviewing, it was my job to provide her advice and positive affirmations. I would try to be considerate of her time and money by suggesting easy and cheap organic foods. I would also find fun ways to teach unhealthy vs healthy foods from a nutrition label. With these strategies, we were able to collectively work through solving her problems. Weight loss is not one-size-fits-all. It‚Äôs important to cater to their needs and be conscious of their background and capabilities. In the end, Patty lost 20 pounds, and it was satisfying to be part of her journey. ","Occasionally when I come home during college breaks, I would drive with my dad to my local church to investigate the condition of the six park benches around the playground. The burgundy paint was chipped and the wood was cracked, but the benches were still in great condition for the several years they have been here. I had a personal connection to these benches‚ÄîI built them for my Eagle Scout project. Part of my motivation to build these benches was to express my gratitude for my local church - the home base for my troop meetings. I have formed incredible memories with other scouts and other church members such as holding ceremonies, cooking, and playing dodgeball in the parking lot. Seeing a need for church kids to congregate by the playground, I realized that park benches were just one way to give back. It is warming to know after several years that my work was appreciated by those that helped me and the kids and parents that continue to use them.",,,1,"In the spring of 2020, my virtual organic chemistry lab consisted of watching YouTube experiments and my professor narrating along the way. I was used to donning my yellow-tinted lab coat, sitting next to my lab partner, and eagerly waiting for the next step in my lab manual. With all of this gone, I took the initiative to find external online resources that were able to supplement the class material. As an active, kinesthetic learner, I looked up simulations of the experiments to get a more immersive experience. While it was not the same as an in-person class, the simulation resource helped me get a better sense of the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù compared to the passive learning my professor provided me. I was therefore able to teach my lab group what I learned, spreading the knowledge in ways they said made a lot more sense. COVID-19 taught me to improvise and maximize my learning potential as much as I can even when my learning environment isn‚Äôt optimal.",1,1,2

My aunt pulled me aside at a family hot pot night to explain in detail how women had little tadpoles in their bodies that would turn into babies, with no mention of the role of the male partner. Growing up, my mother always told me to avoid “cool” fruits and iced drinks because that was what caused vaginal discharge, which was to be avoided because it is considered dirty. My brother and I laughed at how silly they were. It wasn’t until college that I realized that the lack of reproductive health knowledge was anything but laughable. I see the shame they carry about their bodies, the way my mother would snap at me whenever I had a question about my own body with a “wut dut; hm ho gong” [that is impolite; don’t speak of this]. I learned to avoid asking her health-related questions, automatically assuming that I would be met with a cultural myth, false information, or disgust. At university, I realized that my other first-generation American friends had similar experiences with their own mothers, where certain issues with their bodies were taboo. Experiences at home and working with communities very different from mine have taught me to acknowledge and address the stigma and barriers that exist within healthcare. After discovering this prevalent issue, I want to become a physician to deliver culturally sensitive care while creating a safe space for patients to learn about taking preventative measures and long term sustainable plans to improve their health outcomes. 

The Ecuadorian physician I shadowed called in a boy of eight complaining about stomach pain. Seeing the horror on my face after allowing me to hear the rice krispie sounds of the parasites, the doctor casually explained that this was common. Dewormers needed to be prescribed frequently, but the boy didn’t have access to treatment given his location in the rainforest. Dozens of malnourishment and diabetes cases later, I began to notice a pattern in the patients. With the two physicians, a few nurses and the hundreds of patients we saw during those two weeks, I looked around and wondered how this was sustainable. Most of the patients came in with chronic conditions that could not be solved in a single clinic visit. I had the realization that this clinic trip most likely would not have a significant impact without long term care. As exciting as it was to witness dedicated professionals working tirelessly to provide for these patients with conditions I had never seen, the experience triggered a deep, introspective questioning into how I wanted to approach medicine. I realized that patients require consistent care with physicians who can dedicate time to not only treat conditions but also prevent them from arising. I now understand that I want to pursue a career in community medicine where I can build long-term relationships and work on preventative measures to address the chronic diseases facing the community I’m serving. 

Similar to how rural communities in developing countries can be negatively impacted from a lack of health literacy and access, our patients in Oak Park, Sacramento were afflicted with the same conditions due to socio-economic barriers and a historical distrust of medicine. I had a new awareness of parallels reflected in my patients’ lives at Imani Clinic, a free student-run clinic serving the Black community. As a response, I trained to become a Health Educator at Imani to work alongside these community members like “Beth” whose son told me she was at a loss with managing her diabetes. In the beginning, I could tell she was reluctant to listen to my advice on nutrition given that I came from a different background. I patiently explained that I wasn’t going to discourage cultural foods, but simply suggest alternative ingredients, like greek yogurt instead of sour cream, as a first step. Once she saw she could still enjoy fish tacos, I noticed a shift in her body language as she began offering her own ideas. We ended the session with a small list of recipes and a plan to take the stairs to her job instead of taking the elevator for a bit of exercise, showing me the importance of working with the patient by listening to their narratives to achieve sustainable health goals and guide the care I provide. Both abroad and locally, I’ve learned that a key factor of medicine is being mindful of those I will serve and mindful of how my own presence and identity as someone wearing a white coat will affect others, especially in underserved communities. 

During quieter moments, I explained  normal bodily processes to my mother and saw the flash of realization on her face. The same look appeared on a patient’s face after I listened to her concerns. These moments were where I discovered that my strengths lie in individual communication. I take pride in being a safe space for patients to explain their concerns, ask questions, and take control of their health. Seeing how Imani physicians can bring hope to patients who have none has been a great model for the physician I want to become. It brings me great joy being able to help patients who were initially intimidated by the road to recovery become confident in taking charge of their health.","The diversity of experiences growing up in San Francisco allowed me to take multiple perspectives from a different culture. I felt the fear of western medicine through my immigrant parents‚Äô eyes while I educated my parents about why their childhood foods could make them sick. While serving Black and Latinx communities in Sacramento by leading events, initiating the mental health clinic, and intaking patients, I gained many creative solutions for communicating with English learners that I used with my own family. The experience also gave me the information and confidence to speak with my parents during the height of the BLM protests. Without education on implicit bias or social determinants of health, my parents held onto ignorant views, but we were ultimately able to cultivate a safe environment for discussion. From this experience, I learned to lead with patience and compassion when approaching diverse populations, which I hope to incorporate into my interactions with future patients.","Imani Clinic had targeted services for diabetes management, cardiovascular health, and dermatology among many. I noticed that one was missing and in great need, especially for our patient population battling a lack of health insurance and even homelessness. I started the Imani Mental Health initiative with the Behavioral Health Team in response to signs of depression and anxiety in our patients. Firstly, I made sure to incorporate advice from others who were successful in my position, secure training for our clinic volunteers on how to approach potential patients, and formulate a working protocol for screening and referral to services. After I left the position, I implemented my data science skills from my MPH program to analyze screening data to better understand the prevalence of mental health needs in our population. Hopefully, my work could inform our efforts to provide patient-specific mental health services to our patient population.",,,1,"I was fortunate that personal challenges of COVID-19 were limited to difficulties in the virtual transition of school. As a TA, I used creative solutions to effectively communicate the material while learning my own course material. The pandemic was most impactful in how it exposed deficiencies in our health care and education systems. Learning for kids on the autism spectrum suffered, as seen through the rows of missing assignments for my clients. Yolo County experienced severe underreporting of STDs since testing is largely done in person. Many Imani patients canceled their appointments because of the bumpy transition to telemedicine. COVID-19 exposed the gaps in these systems, revealing that we must adapt to our changing landscape to ensure that those most vulnerable do not suffer.",1,0,2

In the act of removing a polyp, the physician punctured his colon. After being unable to stand due to severe pain following the colonoscopy, my dad was rushed back to the hospital for an emergency surgery that removed one-third of his colon. Throughout this ordeal, my dad feared voicing his concerns despite his declining medical and emotional state. As an immigrant with only a sixth-grade education, he felt incapable of questioning his physician’s authority. Despite the severity of his injuries  and growing fears, his physician offered no thorough explanation, sincere apology, or words of comfort. For both of my parents, this traumatic experience began a life-long refusal to seek preventative care, until bothersome symptoms escalated to chronic illnesses that required medical interventions. At 7 years old and without the ability to speak English, I felt helpless as I watched my parents -- models  of strength and perseverance in an unfamiliar country -- appear small and defeated in a room surrounded by doctors. I could only offer empty words of comfort from the side of my dad’s hospital bed. As a physician, I will no longer be powerless. Instead, I will actively reclaim a space in healthcare for low-income immigrant families like my own.  

As I grew older, I strove to ensure that my parents were not dismissed like this again. I learned English and quickly became the representative for my entire family. When my dad needed refills on medications or when my mom searched for affordable insurance plans, I was there to communicate on their behalf. However, by speaking for them, my parents were once again stripped of the resilient independence they showed at home. I tried to remedy this by functioning as their interpreter instead. Although it was a slow and imperfect process, I saw my parents come closer to the animated storytellers that confidently expressed their emotions and demanded rightful treatment in Spanish. I am confident that as a bilingual physician, I will bridge the language gap faced by non-English speaking patients that hinders their quality of care. By eliminating the need to interpret at all, I will reaffirm my patients' capacity to actively play a role in their care - ultimately empowering historically disadvantaged individuals.

When I started college, I worked toward this mission by joining HAVEN, a free clinic that predominantly serves Spanish-speaking patients like my parents. In my role as a Patient Services director, I saw that the mistreatment my parents experienced in healthcare spaces was not unique, and in fact plagued many immigrant narratives. However, cultural and linguistic differences were only partially to blame: financial inaccessibility of medical care was particularly devastating among the undocumented population obtaining care at HAVEN. When patients worried more about their crushing medical debt than their critical illness, it reminded me of the months’ worth of paychecks spent on my dad’s emergency surgery. I felt frustrated that after so many years, access to healthcare for families like my own had not changed.  In my position at HAVEN, I could begin to address this by offering financial assistance from the clinic. However, I realized that being an advocate for vulnerable patients, just as I wish my dad’s physicians had, required using my voice inside and outside the clinic. 

In one instance, I interpreted an encounter where the attending physician failed to insert an IUD twice due to a manufacturing error, repeatedly telling the assisting student, “It’s broken!” I translated these remarks, even though the physician reprimanded me for doing so both times.  Witnessing the patient’s confusion about why a simple procedure was causing so much pain and taking so much time, I saw my own dad. I understood the traumatic consequences of weaponizing language to exclude a patient from knowing what was occurring to their own body.  In seeing the parallels between low-income patients and my own parents, I am driven by a personal commitment to health equity: regardless of language, education, or financial capabilities, everyone should have access to high-quality healthcare. As a physician, I will ensure that patients, such as those from my Latinx community, are not denied this right. 

My experiences have shown me that provision of medical care is not enough by itself. Many families, including my own, face socio-economic insecurity that hinders health despite the most rigorous treatments. To actively combat health disparities, these systemic issues must be addressed. Thus, I want to be a physician that also reforms health at the systemic level by using my voice to advocate  for public policy that dismantles structures oppressing communities of color. Through this work and dedication to culturally accessible care, I will ceaselessly empower low-income immigrant patients as we work together to access the highest attainable standard of care. I will make my parents’ experience the exception rather than the norm.","As a first year college student, I was embarrassed watching my roommates pick out things for our common room at Target that I knew I couldn‚Äôt afford. To my affluent roommates, choosing between paying for decorations or for textbooks was never a worry. _x000D_
At Yale, I continued to be reminded of the wealth and status that surrounded me that I was not privy to understanding. Whereas I initially felt intimidated by this privilege, I eventually pushed myself to engage with my classmates‚Äô complex stories ‚Äî as a First Year Counselor, I listened to students from all socioeconomic backgrounds struggle with imposter syndrome and dream of positively impacting the world. By guiding them through their individual difficulties adjusting to college life, I realized that although I couldn‚Äôt fully empathize with their lived experiences, I could still listen and grow from them. Thus, I learned to navigate these differences while feeling empowered in my own status as a low-income student. _x000D_
","During one of my HAVEN shifts, a Latinx patient refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine. After her medical team conceded and left, she expressed concerns over side effects and fear of exposure of her documentation status. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt get it, but you do,‚Äù she said in Spanish. Understanding her distrust of the healthcare system as a Latina, I spent the rest of the visit reassuring her of the vaccine‚Äôs benefits, confidentiality of her status, and offered translation support scheduling the shot._x000D_
Through these efforts, that patient eventually agreed to get the vaccine. Her medical team then incorporated the same assurances I provided the patient to their future visits. Thus, I was able to use my shared immigrant experiences with medical neglect and state discrimination to rebuild the patient‚Äôs trust towards the life-saving vaccine. Through this practice of culturally competent care, I helped increase vaccine access to this patient and other members of my Latinx community at HAVEN._x000D_

I was born with a lactose intolerance so severe the doctor said I would die without a soy-based formula. My parents found a connection who sold it out of a basement, but the supply was inconsistent. After reading about a child who died of the same disease, my parents decided to use their green card at the ages of 40. Healthcare troubles continued; with a persistent fever and no health insurance, I was rushed to a Boston clinic, where my parents’ fear was calmed by Dr. Leader. As they tried to explain the lack of insurance, Dr. Leader interrupted to say there would be no charge, having intuitively understood our immigrant status. While too young to remember, I spent my bedtimes begging my mom to tell me these stories. Even now, I’ll request a retelling, moved by how much my parents and Dr. Leader did to prevent me from falling through the cracks in healthcare systems.

In high school, we hosted a dinner for Bulgarian students, where I met Ivan, a college student and EMT. His face lit up when talking about patients and the EMS adrenaline rush as I hung on every word. Later, I researched how to become an EMT while still in high school. My parents were frustrated with my interest, worried I would be traumatized, but they were also worried that if something were to happen to them, I might not finish college due to a lack of any other familial or financial support. I took EMT night classes to establish a back-up career, but secretly I hoped to do more, like save a life or help a family.

EMS became my first true love. I even spent my time off-call thinking about patients, like “Jan,” who had suddenly fainted during a funeral. By the time Clay, my paramedic partner, and I arrived, Jan was awake, insisting she was fine. Clay knew something was wrong, and I knew to trust his 20-years-in-EMS gut instinct. So I asked Jan about her manicure and where she got it done, easing us into a conversation. I helped her into the ambulance, where the EKG showed that Jan was having a major STEMI. While panic set into me, I held Jan’s hand, reassuring her. Once we arrived at the hospital, I let out a sigh of relief, thankful that Clay had caught a diagnosis I might have missed. Driving back to the station, I interrogated Clay about how he knew it was cardiac. He gave me the best advice I’ve heard: protocols might be unambiguous, but patients are not. It was like putting on a new pair of glasses—I began to see all the cracks patients could slip through and grew determined to prevent such slips.

In college, I balanced my on-call EMS schedule with computer science classes. I chose my major with the intent of closing healthcare gaps via tech solutions. Medtech was rewarding as a programmer, but I was enticed by the broad scope physicians held. I was coding multiple algorithms for various stroke scales, but I was also bound by a single EMS stroke protocol while physicians had the education and authority to make more nuanced decisions. This feeling, combined with sitting at a computer instead of interacting with patients, left me restless, wanting to do more.

Sitting in Lion Tavern, Tom, a classmate, and I were trading EMS stories, but his were from his Army medic days. He described a cauterizing agent they used in the field that I had only recently read about being added to civilian protocols. The Army seemed likely to provide new challenges, the ability to use my college degree, and the possibility of commissioning as a medical officer. It would also provide financial stability, something still needed years after immigrating, and time to figure out what might come next. After enlisting, there were unfortunately no medical slots. Motivated to serve, I chose a tactical IT position—even hospitals need internet.

The COVID pandemic afforded me a position in the Army’s COVID response team while stationed in South Korea. Working 72 hours a week was tiring, but being adjacent to our unit physicians, like Dr. Ric, was energizing. At each shift change, he answered my eager questions about the rapidly evolving research; even if he wasn’t a Commander, he led from the front. After a slew of night shifts, I picked up the newest patient list for our data analysis, as was routine. This time, I stared at the pieces of paper in my hands, suddenly aware that this was the closest I had been to patients in months. The papers felt heavy. Working to better healthcare systems was not enough for me; I wanted to treat patients too, while leading improvements in healthcare and inspiring others to do the same. In short, I wanted to be a physician.

EMS is still my first love, but now, I can do more. Empowered by the fact that for the first time I know exactly what I want to do with my life, I have retaken classes I once took as a naïve 18-year-old feeling a familial pressure to study science. Every step I take to become a physician is meaningful as it leads me to be able to make the kind of impact Dr. Leader had on my family while contributing to medtech solutions and caring for patients. It’s not just ensuring immigrants feel safe to seek medical care, or even soy milk, but that all patients susceptible to slipping through the cracks receive the care they deserve.","When we moved to New Hampshire from a diverse Boston, I was the only immigrant student. Although I lacked an accent, I had a foreign name, weird lunches, and secondhand clothes. Not always understanding why I wasn‚Äôt accepted, I went through a phase of difficult assimilation during which I rejected anything Bulgarian. The ongoing reality of proofreading my parents‚Äô English and explaining cultural differences bought me time, however, to proudly grow into my ethnicity. I am grateful every day that I never lost this integral part of who I am._x000D_

This experience showed me that if you don‚Äôt fit into the mainstream majority, forming an identity and advocating for yourself become daily, unavoidable challenges. That stress can be alleviated by others taking the time to understand, or acknowledging they have misconceptions. Every individual has their own story; my experiences have taught me to remember that the picture I see is one-dimensional and the truth is much more complex.","As an EMT, I volunteered and worked throughout rural New England, sometimes responding to patients over an hour away.

Not all underserved populations look the same, but they all face health inequities. Having grown up medically underserved as part of a Bulgarian immigrant family, I became more sensitive to these inequities. In my region, EMS had a shortage of Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers, who could be paramedics or Advanced-EMTs. I felt this shortage as an EMT-Basic, radioing for ALS support for critical patients during understaffed night shifts. While conducting a programming internship at Dartmouth College, I successfully took an Advanced-EMT class and earned my certification as a small step towards closing a gap in healthcare access within my community.",,,1,"The pandemic has significantly restricted my ability to volunteer or moonlight in EMS.

Before I knew it, light from the hallway flooded the room as the physician slid the curtain back. The physician directed their attention to my parents and my focus shifted to the dinosaurs and colorful fish adorning the walls, making my 16-year-old self feel out of place. I had overheard the words “blood clots” and the rest of the conversation fell silent to my heart beating in my ears. The physician and their students seemed like shadows at the edge of my ICU bed. I heard the physician ask the residents what indications would be present to move forward with an amputation of my left leg. Working diagnosis: unclear. 

From that day forward, I became fearlessly inquisitive and deeply involved with my physicians and care team. I kept the door open during rounds so I could listen to conversations and plans, seeking the deeper meaning beyond the oversimplifications often presented to me. After an extensive clinical work up I would finally have a tangible term that would explain why deep vein thrombi had ravaged my body. Diagnosis: May Thurner Syndrome. This held deep meaning to me.  I finally had my first cue to explore the vast field of medicine. I dove headfirst into anatomy and physiology, seeking to understand the human form and its anomalies. When it was time for me to apply to college, I knew I wanted to study human physiology. 

Shortly after I launched my academic career, I craved to be a part of the healthcare team.  I distinctly remember one night, working as a pharmacy technician, I was asked to send trauma kits to the Emergency Department. Through the double doors of the Emergency Department trauma bays, I was captivated by the multitude of hospital staff in yellow contact gowns surrounding a confused and fearful patient. The panicked face of the patient contrasted the calm and confident demeanor of the attending physician. The emergency room physician orchestrated the diverse medical team like a master conductor, each specialty taking their solo when the conductor signaled. Diagnosis: hypovolemic shock due to rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Then it clicked for me. A patient, plagued with a vascular condition like I was years ago, laid in front of me. This moment assisted in my realization that I was one step closer to the opportunity of providing care to patients just like me.

I yearned to be closer to physicians and patients, an opportunity that was not present in my time as a pharmacy technician. I pursued a position practicing clinical research within the Emergency Department, where I could be more directly involved in the evolution of treatment and progression of medicine. Peering over more shoulders, working alongside physicians, and interacting with patients daily were highlights of my new position. I was finally able to not only observe, but also participate in the clinical setting by using hands on training.

Despite learning technical skills such as phlebotomy, obtaining vitals, and point of care testing, I still felt as though I was not as involved as I wanted to be. I watched attendings and residents huddle together to practice case studies. They would walk through each case in meticulous detail starting with the physical exam, exploring the pathology, pharmacological options, collaborating with outside specialties, diagnosis, following with patient education. The complexity of each case would increase, requiring the residents to work as a team. I envisioned myself within this team, gaining knowledge, unfolding patient mysteries through the ever-improving tools of modern medicine.

My curiosity led me to a study exploring early sepsis detection in the Emergency Department using infrared technology. New clinical research continues to provide tools to help serve patients faster and more effectively than ever before. Through research, I was not only learning about the process of clinical research, but potentially shaping the way physicians will identify sepsis in their patients. Sepsis may not have been their final diagnosis and may have originated from a multitude of pathologies, but the suspicion of sepsis opens the door for necessary and timely interventions for patients. Ultimately, sepsis taught me that an initial diagnosis can be uncertain and may be discovered over time. This ambiguity calls for early intervention and management through pattern recognition. 

The diagnostic process gives a patient a way to learn about medicine and their own physiology - a gateway to engaging with the healthcare system and promotes shared decision making between physician and patient. It not only paves the way for treatment but gives the patient hope and understanding within medicine. My diagnosis connected me to the field of medicine and allowed me to take part in my care. It served as a catalyst for my passion and instilled me with ceaseless curiosity. It helped me understand what was happening to me. I strive to give this understanding, peace of mind, and hope for resolution for my future patients. Ultimately, I hold the strong belief that my 16-year-old self would be immensely proud of the unlimited potential I wield to further explore medicine and serve others just like me.","When entering a role as a public servant, being competent, respectful, understanding, and empathetic to the ever-diverse population is crucial. When I was diagnosed with my disability, I entered a community of dissimilar individuals that taught me so much about myself and others. I grew to understand that one‚Äôs potential for growth is not limited by the confines of others and that the key to understanding others is being an active listener. Being an inquisitive and attentive listener to others makes others feel heard. This is crucial for building rapport with those unlike yourself as you show an interest in learning about that individual. When working with people of different abilities, I learned how to support others while being extremely flexible and adaptable. I hope to continue my growth and understanding of others and apply it in my medical education as it will help physicians create stronger bonds with their patients and improve the way physicians work with each other.","In my leadership position as Program Outreach Coordinator and Instructor within the ‚ÄúSave MO Hearts‚Äù initiative, I provide free hands-only CPR training to anyone in our community during outreach efforts.

I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Adolescent Scoliosis at the age of 13. As my spine curved unrestrictedly, so did my curiosity for the word “idiopathic.” Is IAS genetic? I did not have a family history. I grew interested in uncovering the biological mechanisms of IAS and through reading countless articles, I discovered there were possible environmental causes. Although I was unable to ascertain the cause of my IAS, I had opened doors to a dimension of human health I had never encountered - environmental health. My following experiences as a researcher and environmentalist opened my eyes to the power of preventive medicine, particularly from the perspective of environmental health, and impassioned me to pursue a career in medicine.

As an undergraduate at Cornell, I immersed myself in the intersection between human and environmental health as a field researcher for Jane Goodall’s One Health Initiative in Uganda. One of my tasks consisted of collecting fecal samples from livestock and villagers to obtain data to map paths of disease transmission between organisms. I recall ascending 3000 feet to reach isolated communities and rambling in broken Rukiga to obtain consent. I spent afternoons in the lab, conducting centrifugal fecal flotations with intermittent solar power and water that I fetched from a local stream. Our objective was to implement prophylactic measures to combat a disease outbreak. The zoonotic disease research I conducted helped me understand just how much human health is influenced by a variety of factors, including those environmental.

I will always remember “Enos,” an 11-year-old I met in rural Uganda. Every morning, I observed him herding goats to the local pond. He caught my attention, as he looked too young to be out of school. As our paths crossed one day, I greeted him in Swahili. “Hujambo!” The language barrier motivated me to spend a few hours each day learning new words and phrases in Swahili. Curious, I questioned why he was not attending the local school. He explained when he was nine, his mother had passed away due to complications related to COPD. “It was charcoal cooking,” he said. His mother had worked as a vendor, grilling maize over charcoal fire for decades. Her doctor had advised her to limit her exposure but the damage had already been done. Recognizing the environmental hazards that adversely affected Enos and other villagers motivated me to combat such disparities as a future physician. Perhaps if his mother’s untimely death could have been prevented, I would have known Enos as an 11-year-old student instead of as a goat herder. Upon each subsequent encounter with street vendors, I made it my mission to spread awareness about increasing ventilation. I even harvested and distributed local palm leaves to be used as ventilating fans. My experiences in Uganda taught me invaluable lessons about health inequities and the importance of prevention, but I yearned to learn more.

While working as a scribe at Long Beach Memorial Emergency Department, I met “Fernando,” who arrived at the ED for evaluation of chest pain. He was a construction worker with a history of smoking and pleural mesothelioma due to workplace asbestos exposure. He had been advised to quit smoking after his diagnosis but was never successful. As Fernando prepared for discharge, I asked the physician if a social worker could place a referral for tobacco cessation behavioral counseling. To my anticipation, the referral was placed. Fernando’s case confirmed that the environmental health disparities, as seen in Uganda, are very much present in my own community and made me cognizant of other drivers of health inequity. It was apparent that the amalgamation of social, environmental, and socioeconomic factors can transcend the pathophysiology of diseases, such as cancer. I understood the role of a physician extends beyond diagnosing and clinically treating patients to include addressing external factors at play.

My experiences affirmed the tenuous nature of our relationship with the environment. To achieve health equity as a future physician, I will strive to contextualize environmental burdens within each patient’s course of care. Environmental change is a pervasive, yet silent disease and I believe multidisciplinary efforts are necessary to tackle imminent health challenges. The confluence of human medicine and environmental health presents a unique opportunity for physicians to better understand drivers of health inequities, particularly in underserved communities. By enlisting my experiences, I hope to not only treat, but also prevent illnesses from a holistic perspective and to push a dialogue in which environmental health is inextricable from human health.

With a spinal curve of 55 degrees, partially corrected with a posterior spinal fusion, I have experienced how medical interventions can profoundly change one’s life for the better. I have seen how systemic health inequities, compounded by environmental factors, detrimentally affect health outcomes. Guided by laughs with Enos and a relationship with Fernando, I aspire to unite medical intervention with holistic, empathetic patient care in order to prevent diseases, promote well-being, and achieve health equity.","While volunteering in Uganda, I observed various obstacles that women face in safeguarding their health. Given polygamy is accepted, many women expressed fear of banishment from their marital homes if they didn‚Äôt bear children. I tried to mask my initial shock when assisting numerous pregnant adolescent girls. However, with research and conversations with local practitioners, I recognized that many of the barriers that women face are due to the socio-cultural realities of the region. My experiences challenged me to not only reevaluate my biases, but also to examine how such biases can influence patients in the US. To work towards achieving health equity, I must acknowledge that I am not immune from implicit biases. I will educate myself on pertinent social issues, participate in discourse, and aspire to create a respectful environment for patients. I want to play an active role in my community to build the cultural competence to treat diverse, patient populations with effective care.","I had the opportunity to conduct a state-funded, community health assessment of an underserved neighborhood in California. We utilized key community based participatory research (CBPR) principles to inform our project design and goals. While working around the initial challenges the COVID-19 pandemic, I virtually interviewed senior residents, performed qualitative analysis of transcripts, and compiled a final report based on feedback. At each step of the research process, we collaborated with key stakeholders to ensure we were accurately capturing their perspective. During a bi-monthly city council meeting, we elevated the resident‚Äôs concerns to the mayor. I recognized that community engagement allows for communities to develop their own research goals and promote culturally relevant research.

We had been out all day and eventually found a spot to relax and eat lunch in a small cove. As we sat and ate, a group of cliff jumpers stood about thirty feet above our heads. My brothers and I begged my dad to join the fun. Initially hesitant, he gave in and allowed us to go, taking comfort in that we were all competitive swimmers and lifeguards. Our longtime family friend, Ruthie, was also visiting for the weekend and decided she wanted to jump.

We all jumped off the cliff into the icy water and swam back to the boat, laughing. The splashes echoing below increased the adrenaline in each jumper waiting to go. It was Ruthie's turn, and everyone cheered her on from the boat, ""Three, two, one, go!"" Ruthie stepped and propelled herself through the air, hurtling towards the emerald green lake. Complete silence followed the thundering smack. We stood there stunned, waiting for anything. Suddenly, a gasp for air echoed through the cove. Ruthie surfaced, shrieking, ""My back!"" My lifeguard training immediately kicked in. I dove in and swiftly put her into a spinal stabilizing hold, keeping her airway above water. I began treading water to keep her horizontal in hopes of minimizing further injury. I comforted her as I helped her through the water, ensuring she would be okay. I continued to tread with her while awaiting the rescue boat to assist. The EMS personnel and I boarded her onto the rescue boat before they raced back to the docks, sirens blaring and lights flashing. A helicopter evacuated Ruthie to the nearest hospital, where she received treatment. While visiting her, the attending physician told us she fractured her spine in multiple places. Had it not been for my life-saving actions, there could have been a much more devastating injury. Although this experience was Ruthie's, through this event, I realized I could make an impact in the world. The outcome could have been much worse without my quick thinking and willingness to act. This experience was the first domino in the line pushing me into the field of medicine.

A few years later, I began scribing at the CHOC emergency department while completing my undergraduate degree. At first, I was overwhelmed by the speed and intensity of the job. I had to learn quickly and adapt to the flow of the ER. I dreaded the shifts and felt great anxiety being responsible for over 65 patient charts daily, each with crucial information. Starting this job in the middle of record-high patient numbers at the hospital was a lot to add to my already stressful schedule of schoolwork and swim practices. Still, I knew if I overcame the challenges, the experience would be worth it. After a few months of late nights in the ER, I became more comfortable and grew to love it. The skills of typing up visits quickly, keeping track of a list of patients, and monitoring lab/imaging results became second nature. This allowed me to dive deeper into medicine, asking questions about reasons for specific orders and understanding why certain results can paint a picture of a diagnosis. I would test myself on the differential diagnoses based on histories and exams before the physicians would tell me, which felt like solving puzzles. Scribing brought me to the center of the physician's thought process, which further fueled my passion for medicine. 

One shift that stands out above all began with a code-critical overhead. We waited outside an exam room for a few seconds until a crying mother was pushed in on a gurney, holding her infant in a swaddle. I saw the baby's pale blue skin as the nurses yelled, ""No pulse, no breathing!"" My heart sank. I knew that a patient arriving with no signs of life had a slim chance of leaving with them. Immersed in the chaos, I still needed to do my job. I remained calm and listened carefully while a brief history was shouted above the noises of IV placement and beginning CPR. Amidst the whirlwind of activity, I watched and recorded timestamps as the physician completed multiple rounds of compressions, pulse checks, and medication pushes. While many of us stood close by, fearing the worst for the baby, hope for survival was fleeting. When I thought the team could do nothing more, the infant started crying. The noise was weak at first but gradually grew to a loud, piercing cry. I never thought I would be so happy to hear screaming, but it meant this child was finally breathing. Joy rushed over me as I thought about the mother being able to go home and hold her baby again. I will never forget waving to the happy baby over the mom's shoulder as they walked out of the ER that day. As I waved, I reflected on the contrast between their arrival and departure. The physician's leadership in saving the child's life greatly inspired me to want to help others in such a way. Although there will be stressful moments, I am eager for the day I can help those in need, just as I witnessed firsthand.

My life's journey has prepared me to succeed in medical school and as a physician. My personal and professional experiences have added to my passion for medicine, which will never leave.","My collegiate swim program developed a relationship with Ceres Elementary in Whittier, California, during my undergraduate career. We volunteered monthly to help with fitness activities, homework problems, and classroom learning. In this underserved community, many children lacked a supportive family structure and came from violence in the household, so they often had trouble focusing in class and gaining self-confidence. During our time together, we helped them through homework problems with positive reinforcement and provided them with the one-on-one attention that nurtured learning habits. Being granted this opportunity to make an impact in these children‚Äôs lives is something I will cherish forever. This experience taught me that you might never know what is happening in anyone‚Äôs life. I plan to take what I learned from my time with these kids and apply it to my care as a physician, treating everyone with respect and reserving judgment for every patient I encounter.","While scribing and researching at CHOC Children's emergency department, I played a significant role in projects that aimed to improve the health of residents surrounding the area. The ACEs project is a tool that identifies adverse experiences linked to negative health outcomes later in life. With this, I screened for child neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional abuse. After the screening, I worked with our in-house social workers to assist when needed. The Social Determinants of Health project was another tool I used in the emergency department to screen families for food or housing insecurities. We provided families access to food pantries, food banks, and affordable housing programs. During my work on these projects, several families told me how impactful these programs were in easing the burdens of raising a family. I am eager to continue my education at an institution where I share these values and further improve the health of my surrounding community.",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, I was finishing my last semester of college in 2020 and excited to move on to my next chapter in life. During this last semester, I had difficulty when all my classes transitioned to online. I had previously taken online courses, so I knew I preferred in-person learning in the classroom. This was an unfavorable change for me, but I was able to prosper by working on organizational skills and self-discipline to maintain good grades. I also worked as a scribe in an emergency department, allowing me to see firsthand what many only heard about on the news. Mask shortages, busy nights spent seeing high acuity patients in pop-up overflow tents, and the high tension of the looming pandemic made this period especially stressful. I am grateful for these experiences in the hospital because they have prepared me for the highs and lows of the duties of a physician that have kept me motivated in my preparation for medical school.",1,0,2

Winds exceed 155 miles per hour and 30 inches of rain fall in eighteen hours. Sitting in my college room, 2000 miles north of Puerto Rico, I wait with my phone on my nightstand. Heartbreaking videos show houses ripped apart and power lines toppled across streets. I think of my grandparents hunkering down in their old house and my young cousins holding their terrified dogs close. Soon after, my father leaves for Puerto Rico, to the home where we had lived, to help our family and bring medical supplies to the community. Given Abuelo’s progressing Alzheimer’s disease and Abuela’s fragile health, I hope that my grandparents might return with my father. However, I know in my heart they will not, and I respect their unwavering love for and loyalty to their island. 

Watching helplessly as the death toll increases, I am keenly aware of how different it is for me to seek healthcare in Massachusetts, than for my family in Puerto Rico. The hurricane exacerbates a growing issue on the island - access to high-quality healthcare - and the destruction causes 70% of hospitals to immediately shut down. That said, I am mindful that my own family’s struggle represents only one among many healthcare disparities. Every day in the U.S., marginalized groups struggle to access high-quality and culturally competent healthcare. After Maria, a deep conviction grows inside of me. Short-term, I will travel to Puerto Rico to assist the rebuilding efforts. Long-term, consistent with my goal of becoming a physician, I will devote my career to improving healthcare equity.

My desire to become a physician took flight in high school when I conducted research investigating the impact of exercise upon the longevity of C. elegans using an electrotactic flow chamber or “worm treadmill.” While presenting at the International Science and Engineering Fair, I was inspired by conversations with fellow students about their work on assistive devices for Alzheimer’s and with NASA researchers about their efforts to decrease astronauts’ muscle degeneration through space exercise. In college, I eagerly reviewed data and wrote countless drafts of presentations to describe the effects of glucose upon fertility in C. elegans. Today, I delight in the opportunity to coordinate all aspects of a clinical research study for patients with testicular cancer at Dana-Farber. Facilitating monthly meetings for oncologists across the globe, I excitedly anticipate the development of new treatment options for the patients that I have come to know. From these experiences, I have developed a deep passion for applying principles of science to help patients live healthy and where possible, disease-free lives.

While research led me to the field of medicine, it is my ongoing experiences with patients that underscore my deep desire to provide culturally competent care. This desire first became clear while working at a large pediatric practice that struggled to recruit Spanish-speaking pediatricians. Frequently asked to translate for patients, I could not help but feel the happiness of families when provided with someone who “spoke their language,” both in words and background. Questions about ear infections often blossomed into conversations about shared heritage. These conversations revealed how important it is to understand and appreciate patients’ cultural beliefs and ideologies when developing patient-provider relationships.      	

Another milestone in my health professions’ journey has been my recent role at Dana-Farber helping to launch a prostate health literacy study. Regrettably, for millions, limited health literacy diminishes access to high-quality medical care. Illustrative of this, I can vividly remember offering to walk a patient line-by-line through a dense consent form because there were no other ways for them to take in the information. Seeking to overcome this issue with high-risk prostate cancer patients, I developed pictograms and handouts that display a patient’s treatment timeline and associated side effects. With each educational interview I conduct, I am filled with a hope that these materials may positively impact at least one patient’s cancer journey.  		        	

It has been almost five years since Maria stormed across Puerto Rico, and over two years since the hurricane of COVID-19 began its wrath. Sadly, my worries about my grandparents came true. Abuelo lost his battle with Alzheimer’s shortly after the hurricane, and Abuela succumbed to COVID-19 after 38 days on a ventilator. Although devastating, these losses have only strengthened the commitment that I made in my first-year dormitory room. Since that time, I have continued to engage in research that nurtures my enthusiasm for applying scientific principles to help individuals live the healthiest lives possible. I hope to continue channeling my passion for promoting healthcare equity, having had the opportunity to provide culturally competent care and to develop health literacy interventions. I cannot imagine a more suitable role for me than to become someone who can provide the expertise and the resources needed to help the most challenged among us as they work to overcome the storms that buffet their lives.","At Dana Farber, I am working on a health literacy project which involves a range of custom handouts and pictograms for high-risk prostate cancer patients. Through this study, I have spoken with patients from a wide range of backgrounds. Some common misconceptions have arisen throughout interviews with patients from all literacy levels; for instance, few know where DNA is found. As most of our patients do not have a science background like I do, I have realized that I may enter these discussions with preconceived notions. For me, a double helix immediately denotes DNA, and the knowledge that cells are the building blocks of all tissue is fundamental. Entire genetic consults have been based off similar assumptions, and these may leave patients feeling lost. Observing this confusion has taught me never to assume that a patient possesses what I believed was ‚Äòbaseline knowledge.‚Äô I have learned to abandon any assumptions, as excellent patient education is the key to providing quality care.","As a Hispanic American, I can share cultural knowledge and traditions with the ever-growing Spanish population in the United States. I first realized the power of a shared background as a camp counselor welcoming a new student, Jav√≠, into our group. I will never forget his sudden burst of excitement when he realized that he was talking to ‚Äúsomeone with an accent in their name like him.‚Äù Our connection allowed him to feel more comfortable in a group of strangers as he shed his previous shy state and grew into an outgoing individual. Learning from this experience, I have used my background with patients at work as it helps to make them feel more comfortable when answering sensitive questions. That said, I acknowledge that I do not share a background with everyone and therefore seek to constantly educate myself on other cultures, traditions, and experiences. In doing so, my goal is to always be culturally humble and welcoming to those of differing backgrounds. ",,,1,"When COVID-19 hit, classes were moved fully online, where they remained for the following year.

Most importantly, my family was directly affected by COVID-19. My grandmother lost her life to COVID-19 after being exposed in her assisted living facility in Puerto Rico.

However, COVID-19 did provide the opportunity for reflection and growth as I strengthened my abilities to communicate, remain adaptable, and practice resiliency in difficult circumstances. These are skills I have put into practice at Dana-Farber, and ones I will continue to use in medical school.",0,0,1

Each morning when I woke up feeling numb and disoriented due to low blood sugar, I felt severe disappointment settle in the pit of my stomach. My endocrinologist eventually confirmed it during an appointment as I sat on the table, staring at the floor: diabetes was here to stay.  
Years went by, but I still dreaded the searing burn of the needle hitting my skin and the ache after every bolus. My dread compounded when I thought about all the other little things: the way my pump tubing would catch every door knob that I passed, how I wouldn’t be able to sleep on my right side, that I would inevitably wake up that night wrapped up in the tubing, and how all these things would hurt so much. While I grappled with my new normal, my pediatric endocrinologist became one of my greatest encouragements, even going so far as to wear an insulin pump, like me. Since my diagnosis, I had frequently been told to “have a good attitude” and had seen my peers cringe when I drew a needle before each meal, but no one had ever tried to experience what I endured on a daily basis. Seeing Dr. Daniels try to appreciate the frustration that came with a pump’s discomfort brought intense relief and profound comfort from no longer feeling so very isolated and misunderstood. This experience first sparked my interest in medicine, transforming diabetes from the worst thing to happen to me into a gift that could allow me to empathize with and encourage my fellow patients. 
The understanding of healthcare that I’d developed from my own diagnosis was challenged when my grandma was diagnosed with end-stage pancreatic cancer during my junior year of college. I went home to be with her as often as I could, regularly flushing her port-a-cath or injecting her blood thinners. By this time, I had spent over a decade giving myself insulin with similar needles and could do it with my eyes closed, but I always felt hesitant as I plunged the needle into her skin, knowing that it was painful. As I watched my once vibrant, fun-loving, and often mischievous grandmother deteriorate until she lay weak and listless in her dimly lit room, I felt desperate to do something. All I could do was lie next to her and hold her hand.  It was in these quiet moments that I resolved to become a physician. I realized that the hope Dr. Daniels had inspired in me as a child had been reinforced by the careful adjustments he made to my regimen and the practical strategies he taught me so that I could live a fuller life.  Where I stood, I had already begun to develop the ability and insight to emotionally support others as they suffered, but I wanted to have the knowledge and authority of the physician to be able to affect change in a tangible, physical way.
With this goal in mind, I sought to experience more of the physician-patient interaction in a hospital setting and began scribing in an emergency department.  During one encounter, Dr. O’Connell examined Emma, a 12-year-old girl who presented with leg swelling. After feeling her legs and listening to her heart, Dr. O’Connell promptly ordered an EKG and chest X-ray which confirmed her suspicion for heart failure. Impressed as I was by her quick and accurate diagnosis, I was more touched by Dr. O’Connell’s ensuing firm yet gentle discussions with Emma's mother, who wanted to take her child home rather than pursue any interventions. As Emma’s mother listened to detailed explanations of Emma’s current symptoms and the repercussions of deferring treatment, I watched her stubborn expression melt into one of concern, then calm understanding as the doctor reassured her that Emma could be well again. This interaction was one of many to reinforce my understanding that with both health and illness come uncertainty, fear, and vulnerability. A physician can address and alleviate each of these by virtue of their insight into the intricacies of a patient’s condition combined with compassionate application of their knowledge. It is this unique coupling of physical and emotional care that has helped empower me to take charge of my own illness, and motivates me to pursue a career as a physician. 
Living with a chronic illness is like running a marathon without knowing exactly where or when the end is. One of its greatest struggles is knowing that few people around me understand the daily physical, mental, and emotional battles I’m fighting to keep running.  Having experienced this deep loneliness and fear, I want to be a person who imparts comfort and instills hope. Furthermore, like Dr. Daniels, who sat beside me as I grieved my lost freedom while also treating my disease, and Dr. O’Connell, who offered understanding and patience along with science-based reasoning to save a young girl’s life, I aspire to have the medical expertise that will allow me to tangibly impact the people that I serve.  Even now, after 15 years, I hold onto a quiet hope that one day I might be healed. The daily longings and disappointments that I face, though unchanged since my diagnosis, now serve to fuel a deeper desire in me: to heal the sick and encourage those who are suffering.","Nausea, dizziness, numbness, tingling, chills - a wave of confusion washes over me while I try to process what my friends are saying.

Hypoglycemic events have been a regular part of my week for 15 years. Not wanting to attract excessive attention, I do my best to mask my discomfort and disorientation. So I‚Äôm thankful that while most will dismiss me, my friends have learned not only to recognize my symptoms, but that they understand my intention isn‚Äôt to ignore them or to be capricious whenever I withdraw from a group. This grace that I receive from my friends is such that I wish to extend to others. I realize that many people have parts of their lives that are uncomfortable or even painful to disclose, and I believe my role is to react with understanding and to offer support should they seek it.","During my junior year of high school, my aunt passed away after a year-long battle with ovarian cancer. Soon after, my 3 young cousins came to live with us, and because I was homeschooled, I joined my mother in caring for them during the daylight hours. Seeking to minimize any pain we might cause, I agreed with my siblings to refrain from embracing our mom or even calling her ‚ÄúMom‚Äù. When school began in January, I looked for the ways I could help to fill in for my aunt, helping the girls with homework, making the food Olivia wanted for her lunch bag, and holding a despondent Ella while she grieved. I knew that I could never replace my cousins‚Äô mother, but I felt that by identifying the situations where they would feel her loss the most acutely, I would be able to help them the most effectively. Watching my girls learn to smile again and thrive in their respective communities was great reward, and I count it among my greatest joys to have loved them during their greatest need.",,,1,"Because of COVID, most of my post-baccalaureate classes were held remotely. Thanks to these online options, I had the flexibility to slowly add on classes or other responsibilities at my own pace. Later in 2020, when hiring freezes were lifted, I was able to work up to 30 or 40 hours a week in the ER while I studied for classes and the MCAT. _x000D_
Being in the hospital throughout COVID taught me many lessons that I believe would not have been as stark in a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù time. I saw the rampant fear that people had when it came to health and wellness, and the high vulnerability patients offered when they chose to seek medical attention. The ER in particular is a place where patients are often at their lowest points, where they come because there is nowhere else to go. Listening to their stories and observing their interactions with providers grew my heart not only for the sick and suffering, but also for the average person who dreads sickness and suffering.",1,0,2
2023,15345167,,23,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"I come from a low-income, second-generation immigrant background. When I was six, my dad switched jobs and his new job did not cover family health insurance. In 2012, I helped my parents apply to Covered California, which allowed us to get basic healthcare coverage. However, due to rising premiums and volatile income, we were forced to switched insurance networks almost annually. My parents also actively discouraged us from going to the doctor's unless there was a severe medical emergency because of co-pay costs. Thus, my siblings and I did not experience longitudinal primary care. As a result of these various factors, I did not realize I had a medical issue (severe sleep apnea) until I was in college. In college, I often waited until my roommate slept before going to bed to not disrupt him with my loud snoring. Since my first year, I have also worked multiple student jobs to cover the cost of attendance so my parents can afford to help my two siblings with their college expenses.

It wasn’t until I was 12 years old and helping my immigrant parents enroll in Covered California that I understood the harsh caveats of the American healthcare system: if you couldn’t afford the insurance premiums, you had no choice in who cared for you. Thus, I learned to expect nothing more from my healthcare than the annual, cursory 15-minute vitals evaluation, conducted by a complete stranger each time. Such disillusionment only intensified when seeing my parents’ healthcare struggles.
One day in 10th grade, my dad came home with his lab results and asked for help Google-ing acronyms such as “A1C,” foreign terms that were never explained to him. That was how we found out he was pre-diabetic. When we called his physician for advice, she told my dad to stop eating carbohydrates like rice if he wanted to avoid developing full-blown diabetes in a few years. Though he did his best to comply, he felt like he was giving up a part of his identity. Watching my father struggle to adapt his lifestyle to his physician’s detached guidance cemented the idea that doctor’s visits were merely a formality rather than genuine opportunities to receive informed care. Thus, while I gravitated towards the biological sciences in college, my conceptualization of healthcare as impersonal and antiseptic made it difficult to see myself as a future physician.
It wasn’t until I started volunteering at HAVEN, a student-run free clinic in New Haven, while at Yale that I realized healthcare did not have to be impersonal and discovered my potential to make meaningful contributions as a healthcare provider and advocate. During my term as Pharmacy Director, I noticed one patient recurringly failed to take his medications. While he was dismissed as irresponsible by his medical team, I thought about my father, whose frustration with his physician’s instructions had led him to ultimately give up on altering his diet. So, I probed the patient as to why he had not been adhering to his treatment. I found out the last time he had gone to pick up his medications at a retail pharmacy, his citizenship status had been questioned, and so he was scared to return. Discovering this – in a way that I wished my father’s physician had considered my father’s background – I picked up the patient’s medications for him and provided clear Spanish instructions for taking them. Recognizing the importance of addressing his concerns, I also clarified the forms of identification necessary and checked in with him periodically to ensure he did not face additional challenges. In doing so, I helped the patient understand that in the future, he could rely on his providers to support him. However, I knew that many in HAVEN’s low-income, largely Latinx patient population were affected by similar systemic challenges. To ease this burden on other patients, I pushed a clinic-wide training to ensure our medical volunteers intimately understood the cultural, social, and political factors that colored our patients’ lives. As a lifelong patient advocate, I will empower my patients by tailoring medical guidance to their personal experiences.
While some situations could be solved with a stronger provider-patient relationship, I also realized that systemic barriers made access to certain life-changing treatments near impossible for many patients. For instance, one patient with Type II diabetes was recommended by attendings to start on SGLT-2 inhibitors, a highly effective treatment. However, without insurance, the medication cost over $600/month, which neither the patient nor the clinic could afford. I knew personally how crushing medical costs could be, since I myself struggled  with costly out-of-pocket expenses associated with sleep apnea treatment. Faced with immense financial burden, many low-income patients were forced to choose between paying for basic necessities (housing and food) and paying for medical treatment; our clinic needed to systematically address this financial barrier to truly provide effective long-term care. Therefore, I spearheaded partnerships with nonprofit organizations and pharmaceutical companies to provide free and subsidized medications to our patients, in hopes that affording treatment would become one less worry in their lives. In finding collaborative solutions to HAVEN’s limited resources, I realized the importance of questioning the status quo and now strive to use my future platform as a physician to open doors to accessible medical care for disadvantaged communities.
Currently, I continue to deepen my understanding of the complex, nuanced interactions between health systems and underserved patient populations. This summer, I am working with Covered California to investigate health outcome disparities among racial and ethnic groups under different health insurance plans. In doing so, we hope to hold insurance providers accountable for key insufficiencies and ultimately create a more equitable standard of healthcare for all. As a physician, I will ceaselessly challenge health institutions to raise the bar on the quality of healthcare provision - so that families like mine can receive the medical attention and informed care they deserve.","‚ÄúBlack people are so lazy.

At Yale, I sought out a better understanding of race relations. Befriending other Yalies of color, I learned about the unique challenges my Black and Brown friends faced due to racialized, structural violence. This gave me a more critical perspective to consider my implicit biases. I realized that my race and upbringing had sheltered me from the threats of policing, widespread poverty, and educational inaccessibility faced by other minorities._x000D_
Acknowledging these critical differences alongside similarities in struggle with other minorities has helped me build a political consciousness integral to my identity.

Cinderella!” I see a 5-year-old girl running at me, unable to control her excitement. An ordinary reaction of any little girl meeting a real-life princess for the first time. Sparkly pink dress, white shoes, and a bald head. Not so ordinary. “Ava” was diagnosed 6 months earlier with Leukemia, having undergone numerous rounds of chemotherapy treatment and procedures. But for the next hour, Ava was able to just be a kid again: dancing, singing, playing games, and even having a princess tea party. Her mother was in tears, saying it had been weeks since she heard her baby girl laugh. Hoping to provide comfort, I embraced her and a soft “thank you” in reply hit me with an intensity of joy I didn’t know possible. Being able to alleviate their pain, even for a moment, is what ignited my interest in medicine. Not only do I want to improve peoples’ lives through compassion, but I seek the knowledge of the fundamental workings of the human body to provide care beyond support.

Working as an in-home caregiver is where I discovered my passion for direct patient care and the value of human interaction. Through this experience I met “Esther”, an 89-year-old woman who I worked with for over a year. When I first met Esther, it appeared that she suffered from loneliness and the grief of her husband’s death. I saw an emptiness in her eyes that indicated she had lost the desire to live and take care of herself. At first, all Esther wanted to do was sleep and watch TV, but with enough time and established trust, I eventually helped her rediscover a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Whether it was talking about her family, going on walks in the garden, or cooking together, my presence seemed to offer a resounding message of encouragement, comfort, and support that she was missing. While the companionship I provided improved her mental state, there were times when my ability to help was limited. Due to her osteoarthritis, Esther often became frustrated at her decreasing mobility and independence. I want to be a doctor because I want to gain the medical knowledge and training to expand the ways in which I can help others. For example, while shadowing Dr. Choles, I learned that reducing sodium intake can help reduce water retention, which lessens the swelling of joints.

To satisfy my curiosity and thirst for knowledge, I joined a research lab for the UW Department of Psychiatry where I became fascinated with the intimate, intersecting relationship between science and patient care. My last year in the lab focused on a study investigating the use of the drug L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine, on enhancing a process in the brain called fear-extinction learning to help reduce symptoms of PTSD in women. Part of my role was to develop trauma narratives based on participants’ experiences of interpersonal violence to be used during MRI brain scans. At first, it was extremely difficult for me to witness firsthand the abuse and pain these women endured, but then it empowered me. I want to become a doctor for them. For those who have lost their voice, living in a constant state of fear and paranoia. This experience taught me the importance of innovation and comprehensive care on improving the human condition, which I plan to incorporate as a physician.

What really attracts me to medicine is that it is a career not only dedicated to continual learning and problem solving, but also to teaching—a combination of leadership and mentorship. Working as a phlebotomist has required me to obtain adequate knowledge about the circulatory system through trial and error and actively seeking out mentor guidance. This knowledge is essential in my ability to explain the plasmapheresis process and to address and provide reassurance to donors during unexpected adverse events. Being able to describe what is happening inside the body in a way that can be commonly understood has taught me the necessity of effective communication with diverse patients in providing exceptional care. Through shadowing, I have observed how Dr. Choles utilizes her in-depth knowledge of the human body systems to explain causes of symptoms, lab results, disease prevention, diagnostic tests, and treatments. The role of teaching in medicine is undeniable as patient clarity is essential for establishing trust, respect, and dignity, which I hope to instill in my patients to provide better care.

Medicine is a hard science, but it is also a practice of treating people. To be an excellent physician requires more than knowledge and professionalism—it requires compassion, empathy, curiosity, a love for problem solving, and effective communication. This is the physician I aspire to be. A physician who recognizes and respects the humanity and individuality of patients to provide sensitive, comprehensive care. A physician who advocates for patients, seeks out alternative solutions to problems, and utilizes innovation to improve the human condition. I know medicine is for me because it is a holistic discipline that demands all of me and continuously challenges me to be a better person, allowing for the most rewarding patient relationships. In the meantime, I can be found changing lives one needle at a time—dreaming of the day I get to exchange the blue dress for the white coat.","Working as a phlebotomist at a plasma donation center has provided me with the opportunity to interact with many individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, which has furthered my awareness of my own privilege and bias, and has deepened my understanding of the social determinants of health. For example, a young African American woman shared with me that the reason she donates is because she needs the money to pay for a car repair that she cannot afford since she is a single mother and does not have a full-time job. As a medical scribe, I have also witnessed patients in the ED who are hesitant or worried about receiving care due to lack of health insurance and monetary concerns. Prior to college, I used to believe that illness and health were solely defined by biological and individual factors, but I now understand how cultural, social, and economic factors can disproportionately impact underrepresented populations to influence access to healthcare and the likelihood of disease.","Through my volunteer work with A Moment of Magic, I have served medically vulnerable and underserved children to improve quality of life by inspiring them to be brave, strong, and fearless through fun and engaging social wellness activities. Dressing up as princesses and superheroes gives these children a unique opportunity to interact with the people they look up to most, which is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Being able to provide imagination and joy to sick children and communities who do not often have similar opportunities is an invaluable gift that I am so honored to have been a part of. One experience I particularly remember is surprising a little girl with Down Syndrome at her birthday party. The smile and amusement on her face when we walked in is a reflection of the impact that we have. The girl‚Äôs mother sent us a message a few days after our visit to tell us that her daughter cannot stop talking about it and brags to everyone she knows about her new magical friends.",,,1,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was unable to continue volunteering at American Family Children‚Äôs hospital, which is still suspended at this time. I have attempted to find other health related volunteer opportunities since, but they have been difficult to come by. To continue gaining medical experience and serving the community, I applied to a CNA program at SSM Health St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital in March of 2020. I got invited to interview, but unfortunately the position was withdrawn afterwards due to the pandemic._x000D_
_x000D_
It was difficult to find medical related jobs that were still going when the pandemic first hit, which was frustrating at times because all I wanted was to be able to help in some way during a much needed time. Nonetheless, I was determined to keep looking, and eventually found a position as an in-home caregiver with Comfort Keepers. I am very thankful for this opportunity to serve such a vulnerable population during a time when they needed it most.",1,0,2

My mother held my hand as we rushed into the emergency department. To distract myself from the aching abdominal pain, I closed my eyes and imagined myself at my next track meet. My appendicitis diagnosis felt like my biggest hurdle yet. 

At that moment, my only fear was missing track practice. My naturally anxious parents had worries of their own. “Dr. Li” maintained a calm demeanor and adapted to address our individual concerns. “In no time you’ll be able to cross the finish line.” Strangely, this statement brought me instant relief. I was not seen as another patient with appendicitis, but as a young girl who was passionate about running. Dr. Li’s inclination to consider not only my diagnosis but also my personal circumstances served as a source of comfort during a time of pain. Here, I realized the importance of forming human connections in medicine. I grew determined to replicate this feeling of unconditional support for other patients and their families.

Eager to connect with patients, I became a volunteer in the child life department at CHOC. One memorable patient, “Amy,” was hospitalized for leukemia. I was responsible for ensuring that Amy completed her math homework. Unfortunately, she began seeing me as a daunting reminder of her unfinished homework. It became my personal mission to make math enjoyable for Amy by introducing fun methods such as art and games. Day by day, Amy's smile grew as I would come by her room. It was a warming reminder that medicine is not only about treating illnesses but also about building relationships. As I drew parallels between my experience with Dr. Li and with Amy, my desire to become a physician who appreciates the “human” quality of medicine was reaffirmed.  

I learned a similar lesson working with pre-collegiate students as a Campus Representative for my university. One day, I led a tour for students from East LA. As I began to recite my meticulously rehearsed script, I noticed that my group was not engaged. I decided to start an open conversation about college with them and learned that many of these students had never thought of higher education as an option before due to cost or other factors. I then asked them all to share a hobby they had. One student, “Joe,” told me he liked to write stories. I explained to him the opportunity to pursue an english degree through financial aid and scholarships. At the same time, I made sure to acknowledge that while college could be a path he chose, it was not his only option. These special conversations transformed the way I saw patients during my clinical experiences as each patient has a unique story that must be understood. My goal is to clearly educate my patients on all their options with full transparency. I hope to foster an environment of open communication, where I connect with patients through humanity and vulnerability. By doing so, I can empower them to reach their health goals by adapting my medical approaches to their needs. 

Seeking to apply this approach in a medical setting, I began working as a scribe for the endocrinology clinic at CHOC. There, I often worked with patients who did not have sufficient access to healthcare. I remember when “May” first came into the clinic. Her son “Sam” had type 2 diabetes, which had been difficult for her to manage because she worked multiple jobs just to cover the cost of his insulin. After visiting with the doctor, May stood up to leave when I noticed a look of exhaustion on her face. Eager to help, I told her that the hospital had resources that provide access to affordable and healthy food, well-suited for diabetics. She smiled, took the brochure, and told me she was grateful. I felt as though I had not helped her enough; however, this experience influenced my aspiration to become a primary care physician who advocates for policies that improve health equity for underserved populations. 

Recognizing how socioeconomic factors disproportionately affect the health of certain communities, I came to appreciate the value of preventative care. While scribing, I observed how type 2 diabetics can be taken off their medication by managing diet, stress, and exercise. I joined an ED study called Adverse Childhood Experiences to promote access to preventative measures. I surveyed patients to screen for neighborhood-level factors such as food and housing insecurity and connected families with resources. Having witnessed how these simple gestures can improve pediatric health outcomes, I grew inspired to use my future platform as a physician to increase disease prevention. This commitment fuels my desire to pursue the path of medicine. 

These experiences working with different communities remind me of the rush and excitement of race day. They left me with a desire to not only advocate for all patients, but also ensure that their care is as personal as Amy taught me, culturally competent as Joe taught me, and comprehensive as Sam taught me. Now as I embark on my longest race, I recognize my new goal: to cross a different finish line that will allow me the opportunity to connect with every patient and deliver the compassionate and holistic care I once received.","I worked as a Campus Representative at my university through which I interacted with prospective students and their families from all walks of life. During the first campus tour I gave at UC Irvine, I began by explaining the majors offered. One student, ‚ÄúIan,‚Äù stated that he had never heard of the term ‚Äúmajor‚Äù and that his high school never discussed attending college. I realized that my scripted tour could not be applied to everyone, so I explained every concept I introduced, allowing Ian to feel comfortable asking questions and expressing his fears. _x000D_
 _x000D_
Growing up, my parents reinforced the importance of attaining higher education, so I never considered any other path. Knowing my students, including Ian, came from different backgrounds, I sought ways to empower them and make them comfortable, whether it was to attend college or navigate an alternative career path. At RUSH, I hope to continue to advocate for peers, educators, and patients alike to feel comfortable in every space. ","I am a medical scribe at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Orange County Emergency Department, which serves a diverse, medically underserved patient population where adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are common. _x000D_

‚ÄúEli,‚Äù a six-year-old foster child, had presented for dehydration and weakness. Eli‚Äôs foster mother shared that his biological mother was a substance abuser and had neglected Eli‚Äôs care: he hadn‚Äôt been seen by a pediatrician for some time and his vaccines weren‚Äôt up to date. I offered Eli‚Äôs foster mother pamphlets on nutrition protocols, connected her to a social worker, and relayed the history to the physician. Ultimately, these interactions exposed me to issues I will encounter as a physician and highlighted how I can promote my patients‚Äô well-being. I currently help with ACEs screenings and provide families with self-care and community resources. As a physician, I hope to leverage my platform to implement screenings, education, and care coordination to support my patients. ",,,1,"After COVID-19, all of my extracurricular activities and research were put on hold. Fortunately, I‚Äôd completed most of the coursework for my major, so I used my free time to take enough courses to graduate a year early and adapted my job hunt for the constraints of COVID.  _x000D_

As I looked for ways to contribute to healthcare, I first secured a job as a pharmacy technician at CVS and then worked as a medical scribe in a pediatric endocrinology clinic. At the clinic, I saw how increased telemedicine improved access and provided a safer alternative for our immunocompromised patients. Additionally, although my on-campus research opportunities had been on hold, I joined a metabolism lab at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Orange County where I was assigned my own project. Now that health and safety restrictions have been lifted in my area, I also hope to volunteer at a free clinic in Los Angeles this coming fall.

It is a familiar scene around me: my mother is sleeping on a cot in the corner. The medication pumps beep intermittently, and I hear the nurses outside the room. 

Most of my peers began to develop their personal and professional identities at my age, navigating their way through college; however, I was battling a different beast throughout that time. At 16, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Since my symptoms began, I woke up with unbearable cramps and nausea each morning. Despite these obstacles, my circumstances have only cemented my childhood dream to become a physician and bring forth the impactful perspective as a patient to that of a clinician.

Although my days were filled with doctor’s appointments and medications that weighed on me, I committed to keeping my classes at the forefront of my priorities. I immersed myself in places of solace, whether through volunteering at the local free clinic, playing sports, or expanding my sneaker business. Unfortunately, by the end of my first year of college, all treatment options had been exhausted, and my illness had taken a severe toll on myself and my family. My physician suggested surgery, discussing it extensively with me when I was worried about my physical stability. I will never forget the feeling of looking across the examination table hoping for some good news or even a simple “we will figure this out.” Despite my initial fear of the risks of the surgery, Dr. Abraham assured me that we were on this journey together. On the other side of my five procedures, I found myself a more confident, optimistic student with aspirations to encompass the treatment of illnesses with the actual patient.

With the setbacks of chronic illness and numerous surgeries, I realized how much of a toll they had taken on my mental health. Further research showed that people with lifelong conditions could further spiral into anxiety and depression, which only deteriorates their health. I sought to factor mindfulness into my routine, and I was able to find support in my family. At first, it was a struggle to divulge my worries to my parents, as I was aware of the stigmas surrounding mental health. These stigmas appeared everywhere, but most notably for me was the South Asian idea that depression was a sign of weak faith. I was fortunate to have highly understanding parents, but I knew that many others did not have the same support that I did. This fundamentally became the center of a student-led college course I taught, focusing on stigmas around mental health, and led me to develop a program to help families at my local mosque identify numerous mental health issues. This program aims to provide education and resources such as psychiatrists and therapists with the help of Dr. Asim Shah. As a prospective physician, I find it necessary to advocate for self-care and to learn how to comfort patients in various ways in times of need.

When I healed from my surgeries and was able to return to normalcy, I faced each day with reinvigorated health and a fresh outlook. I returned to volunteering at AsSalam Clinic, where I had the opportunity to assist specialists in providing free health care to immigrant and refugee populations. These communities suffer from low health literacy and inadequate access to care. I recalled how I felt in my appointments, hoping to hear some reassurance that I was not alone. I felt privileged to have the opportunity to show the compassion I longed for as a patient. It was important to remember that these patients were dealing with many hurdles and further reminded me that physicians must also be well-versed in exhibiting compassion to their patients.

My time volunteering revealed the multiple disparities in the healthcare field and made me contemplate how fortunate I was to have abundant access to healthcare. I decided that I wanted to focus on bridging the healthcare discordances present in our healthcare landscape. I intend to care for marginalized patients while working to increase patient education and help pave the way for healthcare equality.

Dealing with ulcerative colitis presented a significant association between my healthcare experience and obligations as a member of society. As a hopeful physician, I aim to integrate what I have encountered to fully understand the interacting factors that affect the ability to provide holistic, patient-centered care. All the while, I hope to tackle barriers experienced by my future patients by establishing mental health interventions and reducing obstacles in access to care. My time as a patient, student, and volunteer has further solidified my desire to become a physician and granted me a unique conglomeration of perspectives in medicine. I look forward to treating future patients with empathy and sympathy to ultimately help them find restored health and peace.","A prime component of my healthcare experience has been my involvement in the local free clinic, Assalam clinic. There, I was a scribe and took history/vitals, allowing me to interact with a cluster of patients from different backgrounds. We treated primarily underserved and marginalized communities. From them, I learned how difficult healthcare experiences are for uninsured or underinsured and marginalized patients. It is challenging for patients to trust the healthcare system, especially one with high costs for hospital visits, ambulance rides, and daily prescriptions. It can be terrifying for a patient to visit a healthcare facility, and for me, it is crucial to connect with the patients by trying to find something I can relate to or learning about their backgrounds. From my experience, I also learned that as a physician, it is vital to understand the patient's culture and wishes related to their care. I hope to treat patients with empathy and respect in the future. ","I remember meeting Saima, a widowed mother who brought her five-year-old son. She trembled in the waiting area, murmuring prayers under her breath. When I asked if she needed any help in Urdu, her native tongue, she burst into tears. I held her hand as I reassured her everything would be okay, and a physician would be available to examine her son soon. I listened to her anxieties about her child's future and helped her enroll in a public healthcare plan. She displayed the utmost gratitude for just hearing about her struggles. Patients like Saima came in often at the free clinic, and I enjoyed being a service to them by also educating patients on preventative healthcare and resources so that they can understand their own conditions and risk factors. I also worked with the executive board to expand our services to three days a week, with additional funding and marketing. This meant that more patients could find appropriate healthcare when they may not have other options. _x000D_

At first, I thought it was said to encourage my brother to speak. He was diagnosed with Autism when I was seven years old. I did not understand what that diagnosis meant then, only that things were different and my family’s dynamics changed. Therapists started to show up to work with my brother, raising my awareness of the changes happening around me. I often attended my brother’s sessions as they were fun, and we mostly played games to work on skill deficits like turn-taking. Later on, I became a “peer” for other children with Autism when they needed a play partner. I also noticed that my mother became more involved in the community, constantly mentoring families with newly diagnosed children to help them acquire services and support. Words like “struggle” and “advocate” became everyday utterances. I also came to learn the origin of the phrase “Let me hear your voice.” It is the title of a book written by Catherine Maurice that details the life of a mother of two children with Autism. The words spoke to me, and the message was clear: empower the voiceless to have their voices heard.
I carried this message with me throughout high school and into college. 

My undergraduate education was well planned: pharmacology and drug development and a bachelor's in biology. I wanted to follow in my father's footsteps and become a pharmacist, so I started to clerk at his pharmacy. I saw my father constantly advocating for his patients by contacting insurance companies and drug manufacturers and speaking on behalf of his patients to make their voices heard. ""Let me hear your voice"" echoed in my ears whenever I saw this. Simultaneously, I became curious about the pathophysiology of the ailments I encountered when patients came in. A physician's treatment plan and his choice of medication became a topic of discussion and daily research. My interests were branching out and I was drawn to medicine.

In the Summer of 2019, I began to shadow Dr. Shenouda, a physician at Centro Medico Guadalupano in South Gate, California. His clinic predominantly cared for an underserved Spanish-speaking population. Patients often needed assistance filling out medical history forms and I jumped in to help. I learned about free medical assistance programs offered and began speaking to patients about these options. However, to my astonishment, many patients did not want to sign up, indicating a lack of trust in the system. During visits, some barely asked any questions or requested further explanations. And that is when that phrase jumped in my head; I almost wanted to scream, “LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICE!” Dr. Shenouda saw my confusion but encouraged me to be persistent by continuing to offer help and guiding the patients through their medical care. While engaging these patients was difficult, I saw Dr. Shenouda attempt to connect with all of his patients by speaking in Spanish to ease the language barrier, suggesting further testing, and personally reaching out days later to check-in. It was inspiring to see a physician take the initiative to rebuild their trust in the healthcare system and strengthen physician-patient interactions.

One interaction was particularly memorable. A Hispanic 11-year-old boy came in for a follow-up visit to confirm a diabetes diagnosis. “Vicktor” had severe Autism and limited food preferences. I remembered those days with my brother before he got therapy. After Vicktor left, I felt compelled to speak to Dr. Shenouda about the help he could receive, just as my brother did. I learned that he was offered minimal services by his school, and since the family had limited insurance, they had a hard time finding providers for their son. Dr. Shenouda wrote a referral to a nutritionist and an occupational therapist to work on swallowing pills to help Vicktor take his medication. In the meantime, insulin was necessary to stabilize his blood sugar. I was heartbroken to see the obvious medical inequalities that Vicktor experienced, unlike my brother, and I wondered about all the other patients like him. I hope to emulate Dr. Shenouda’s patient-centered approach to medicine as I continue to advocate on behalf of my patients during my medical career.

While COVID-19 interrupted my other volunteer plans, I kept up with Dr. Shenouda and continued helping with his underserved patient population by transcribing patient charts from his telehealth visits for his other practices. I read about vaccination rates being the lowest amongst the lower socioeconomic groups during that time. Again the “voiceless” were the most affected. The pandemic showcased that medical inequality was more prevalent than ever in our healthcare systems and highlighted a pathway for my career. As I reflected on this, my purpose was cemented. From my experiences with my brother to the populations I have worked with clinically and in volunteer experiences, I have seen first-hand the impact of health disparities and stigmatization. I strive to become a physician who can address the physiological consequences of disease and the more systemic issues within our healthcare system by empowering those whose voices are not heard.","During my medical mission in Egypt, I witnessed the adverse effects of a lack of care available for patients, which _x000D_
were further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. I saw pediatric malnutrition and complications from the mismanagement of chronic diseases in adults. Additionally, shadowing at Centro Medico Guadalupano para La Familia had exposed me to a marginalized, minority community in the US where I attempted to make patients aware of free medical services that they could receive through government organizations. These experiences showed me the extent to which health inequity impacts lives, as well as the difference healthcare workers can have by caring for patients while being cognizant of their social situation. These experiences shifted my perspective of medicine through which I developed a greater understanding of how the socioeconomic factors of patients impact their health. These lessons are ones that I hope to utilize and share through my journey at Rush."," I hope to serve as a caregiver and advocate for my patients to ensure they receive the care they deserve. I have a brother with autism and was taught early on the need to be his voice when necessary. The world is not always kind or accommodating to those who are different, and I made it my mantra to advocate for and include those who cannot do so. Throughout my school career, I was always a ‚Äúbig buddy‚Äù within the special needs community. I maintained a mentor-tutor relationship with one of the kids I mentored in high school. I helped him academically and continue to help him socially.  As I continue to be part of his life today, I feel content that I am able to contribute a small part to his well being. These interactions have prompted me always to be an advocate for those who may not have the opportunity to stand up for themselves._x000D_

I had to adapt my learning style from being a hands-on learner to what I saw on a screen. I avoided distractions and managed to excel in all my classes. Structure and routine were vital.  I was scheduled to take the MCAT in June 2021. Unfortunately, all prep courses were canceled and I had to rely on books. I went in feeling unprepared yet still managed to do well. Not all of Covid‚Äôs effects were negative. The time I spent with my family was priceless and strengthened our bond. I also reconnected with my old high school friends.

I pulled the covers up over my head as far as I could, held my breath, and squeezed my eyes shut. This isn't happening. This is not happening… I gasp and bolt upright out of bed, sweat pouring down my face. The nightlight in my quiet room radiates the time on the wall: 2:47 AM. I sprint down the hallway to my parents’ room, where I temporarily feel safer, and attempt to quiet my mind enough to fall asleep again.  

Night terrors like these were my routine for six years: every night was a struggle between my mind and body. It all began following the sudden death of my 65-year-old grandfather when I was seven; grappling with the reality of loss and death at such a young age triggered years of anxiety and sleepless nights. My siblings watched from afar as the troubled middle child was taken to doctor after doctor in an attempt to cure her “disease.” The more I struggled, the more determined I grew to persevere. At age 13, I finally conquered my anxiety and insomnia with the help of my family and a child psychiatrist who has since become my inspiration for a career in medicine.

Overcoming my anxiety, with the help of others, has inspired me to find ways to pay it forward. Growing up in Baltimore, I spent my afternoons teaching dance to children in inner city schools, providing them with an alternative to spending time on the streets. In my senior year of college, I worked as an organic chemistry laboratory teaching assistant, combining my love of science with the opportunity to help students who were struggling through the class. Throughout all four years of college, I was a member of Pizmon, a pluralistic Jewish a capella and outreach group that uses music to lift the souls of those in need. It is in moments like these that I have discovered my passion for serving others.

As a result of the unwavering determination I developed in my battle with anxiety, I am never satisfied with “good enough” and always push myself toward excellence in all pursuits. Having trained in biomedical engineering in college, my drive to engineer change in the world led me to two part time jobs: one in biotechnology commercialization, and the other in teaching. While my role at Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures reinforced my passion for solving scientific problems, my time spent teaching at Roland Park Country School has guided me towards a more personal career with genuine human connection. Beyond simply teaching, I helped many students at Roland Park cope with mental health issues that had been exacerbated by the pandemic, and I have found nothing as fulfilling as helping someone overcome their obstacles. 

Working as a medical assistant at a dermatology practice during the summer of 2020 allowed me to help others in a medical setting. Since the office was severely short-staffed due to COVID-19, my job responsibilities included just about everything: escorting patients to rooms, taking preliminary medical histories, obtaining chief complaints, assisting during full body exams, preparing patients for biopsies, and assisting during surgical and aesthetic procedures. I fell in love with the job, excitedly putting on my scrubs every morning and arriving early to work to jump in. I began noticing abnormal moles before the doctors pointed them out and pulling out the correct ointments without being told which one would be best for treating the situation. The quiet joy that accompanied each time I correctly identified a problem or helped make a patient feel comfortable filled my life with purpose. At the end of each day, my feet hurt from standing and my face burned from the N95 mask and goggles, but I didn’t care; I loved looking in the mirror and seeing the indentations from my PPE, because to me they were a symbol of the good I was contributing to the world. 

In 2021, the summer after graduating from college, I pursued additional opportunities to give back by taking on the role of Health Care Director at Camp Walt Whitman, a sleepaway summer camp in New Hampshire. My role involved minimizing COVID-19 risk for the campers, and it was extremely fulfilling to contribute medically toward restoring a slice of childhood to the many campers who had just endured more than a year of deprivation in the pandemic-affected world. This experience deepened my desire to help others through medicine and helped further develop my love for working with children.

Becoming a physician will allow me to continue to pursue my passion for solving scientific problems, while also enjoying the privilege of healing and genuinely connecting with human beings on a personal level. As I reflect on my life and the mental health obstacles I have overcome, I am determined that others should not have to go through what I did, which is why I am drawn to the field of psychiatry. Through my own battle with anxiety, I can relate to patients firsthand and can help them understand what my child psychiatrist first showed me: that your diagnosis is not a disease, but a part of what makes you human.","In the summer of 2020, my sorority began to discuss issues of systemic racism in Greek life. Many students of color shared discriminatory experiences that made them feel unsafe and unwanted. The lack of action in response to these revelations left many feeling unheard, causing them to leave the chapter. After reading many educational articles, speaking with close family and friends, and self-reflecting, I withdrew as well. _x000D_
As this occurred in the wake of George Floyd‚Äôs death, I attended a Black Lives Matter rally in my hometown of Baltimore to show my support and solidarity. Throughout these experiences, I grew more aware of the struggles that people of color face on a daily basis, and the negative effect people can have as bystanders. The rally opened my eyes to the importance of unity and working together in building a kinder, safer future. In medicine, I will continue to try and understand the minority perspective, promote diversity, and fight for equality and inclusion for all.","I recently volunteered for a virtual tutoring platform that helps struggling readers from disadvantaged communities. I was paired with a first grader from a school located in my hometown of Baltimore City. Each week, I met with him online to help him practice his reading skills and boost his confidence. While he struggled significantly in the beginning, I quickly found ways to improve his abilities by reading stories about his own interests. At the end of the year, I was invited to visit his school to celebrate his progress. He immediately latched onto me and told me all about his long trek to school every day. It was clear he had a difficult home life. ??The pure joy on his face when I gave him my copy of the book ‚ÄúOh, the Places You‚Äôll Go!‚Äù will forever be ingrained in my memory as one of the more meaningful impacts I have had on another person. I am volunteering for this program again this school year, as I hope to continue to leave a positive impact on the Baltimore community.",,,1,"The pandemic prompted my summer 2020 employment plans to shift and collapse many times. I was sent home from college as it went virtual for my final three semesters, and I was no longer able to complete my research in the Ghosh Lab, which I had been excited about continuing through graduation. As I scrambled to come up with a meaningful way to spend my summer, my mother and her business partner struggled to find staffing in their medical and cosmetic dermatology practice. They offered me the opportunity to work for them full time as a medical assistant. This experience made me appreciate the medical profession and its importance during a pandemic. After this opportunity, I began and completed my senior year virtually. Taking my classes and being a TA for a lab course virtually led to extreme personal growth in the form of mental toughness and willpower. Remaining focused and determined in utter chaos without in-person gatherings was a challenge that has only made me stronger.",1,1,1
2023,15357052,,26,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"I grew up in a small two-bedroom home shared by my parents, brother, sister, niece, and nephew. Our home was located in the parking lot of my parents' workplace, so in exchange for cheap rent, my parents were expected to be on call 24/7 while only making a combined $45,000/year. 

To save up for college, I was working at a hospital on the weekdays, delivering Indian food on weeknights, and working at my high school’s flea market every Sunday from 6 am to 2 pm. 

While in college, I qualified for the Pell Grant all four years which helped immensely with tuition, but I still struggled to cover food and personal expenses. After developing better study techniques and getting accustomed to the rigorous workload, I was able to cover all of my personal expenses by working three part-time jobs while also maintaining a full-time class schedule and an upward trend in my GPA.

Although these experiences were undoubtedly stressful and sometimes even suffocating, they forced me to refine my time management skills, taught me how to persevere through adversity, and illustrated the importance of delayed gratification.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,8310,750.0,,100.0,4400.0,300.0,1,100,1,4700,04/09/2022,University of California-Berkeley,Molecular &amp; Cell Biology - Neurobiology,0,,Yes,No,No,"$25,000 - 49,999",7,1,1,1,0.0,65.0,0.0,0.0,30.0,5.0,0.0,13,Adequate,2,2023,3,0.0,1.0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,"I still remember it was three in the morning when I was startled awake by a call from my boss. “Andy? Sorry, I know it’s late, but a patient is getting airlifted to John Muir. Can you cover the case?” I agreed without hesitation and was on my way to my first trauma call. I rushed to the operating room, where I met a 26-year-old man with an unforgettable look of regret. He crashed and flipped onto the side of the road, fractured his neck, and was on his way to becoming a quadriplegic if the surgery did not begin soon. The anesthesiologist intubated the patient, I placed my electrodes, and the surgeon made an incision in the back of his neck. I monitored the patient’s nerve roots and spinal cord while the surgeon delicately stabilized the spine with screws and rods. When the procedure was over, I asked the surgeon if the patient would ever walk again. “It is possible. Thankfully we intervened quickly, or the damage would have been irreversible.” As I drove to my subsequent surgery later that morning, I was still processing what I had just witnessed, making me question why I wanted to become a physician. 

I am the youngest son from a family of Mexican immigrants who moved to California with nothing. Despite lacking a formal education, my parents worked tirelessly to provide for my siblings and me. They ensured we had access to opportunities they never had. Although I was grateful for their sacrifices, I felt like a financial burden watching them perpetually work at such an old age. I was motivated to provide for my family, and at 16, I earned a spot in a paid internship at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. This opportunity cultivated my interest in the medical field as it exposed me to the various roles within the hospital, and I was fortunate enough to shadow doctors, nurses, and physician assistants. By the end of the program, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in medicine, so I became the first in my family to go to college.

During my junior year at UC Berkeley, I began scribing for a gastroenterologist, Dr. Ezzeddine, who quickly became my mentor. I admired her extensive medical knowledge and dedication to treating every patient. Some of her patients were chronically ill, and Dr. Ezzeddine worked relentlessly to find solutions to aid their constant suffering. She instilled hope and trust within her patients and inspired me to consider becoming a physician. I was unfamiliar with the application process at the time, and my graduation was quickly approaching. With my degree in neurobiology, I searched for a full-time job to stay financially afloat while figuring out the prerequisites for applying to medical school.

Despite graduating during a pandemic, I found a job as a surgical neurophysiologist. This role introduced me to the operating room and has allowed me to work alongside physicians at a dozen different hospitals in the bay area. I monitor patients’ nervous systems during spine and brain surgery and communicate the data directly with the surgeon to minimize neurological damage throughout the case. Meeting with patients before surgery, working in synchrony with the OR staff during surgery, and applying my medical knowledge throughout have been incredibly fulfilling. Even on days when the surgery lasts over 12 hours, it is gratifying to know that my work contributes to the betterment of others. There is no better reward than knowing a patient is doing well after surgery. 

A year had passed since my first trauma case, but it still felt fresh in my mind. Watching someone nearly my age get rushed to surgery due to a severe spinal cord injury was surreal, and I constantly thought about how the young man was doing. I decided to schedule a chat with the neurosurgeon who performed the procedure to ask for a follow-up, which left me in disbelief. After strenuous physical rehabilitation, the patient regained most of his sensory and motor function and can walk and run with only minor difficulties. After our conversation, I walked back to my car with an insuppressible smile. Although the hours in this role may be hectic, and the outcomes can be grim, victories like these push me forward and remind me why I want to become a physician.","My fondest childhood memories involve my family's yearly summer road trips to my father and mother's hometowns. Living in Mexico forced me to integrate into a new culture. It allowed me to practice my Spanish and learn about my community's culture and traditions. Overall it helped me become more appreciative of my everyday life after seeing how difficult life can be in Mexico._x000D_

Another experience that has molded my personality is working in the operating room for two years. It can often be a stressful environment, yelling is not an uncommon occurrence, and a lesson I learned early on was not letting people's behavior cloud my judgment of their character. I try and apply this lesson whenever I meet someone new because it helps me understand their actions more deeply. Considering external factors such as their situation, culture, financial situation, etc., makes it easier to empathize with them rather than make an incomplete and unfair assessment of who they are as a person.","Throughout my career as a surgical neurophysiologist, I have witnessed the devastating consequences of spinal cord injuries, such as paralysis, numbness, and loss of bowel and bladder control. Working in this field made me realize how susceptible we are to life-altering accidents in our everyday lives, and in addition to serving as a daily reminder to be grateful for my health, my job has motivated me to help individuals affected by spinal cord injuries._x000D_

Outside of the OR, I volunteer at my local rock climbing gym. Through a program called ParaCliffHangers, I have become friends with paraplegic climbers in my community, contributed toward new gym equipment through fundraisers, and learned more about their disabilities as we rock climb.

Many afternoons, I recall strangers stopping him and offering a handshake saying, “Dr. Wong, thank you for saving my vision!” After seeing the impact he made on others, I couldn’t help but want to learn more about what he did. The following summer, I asked my dad if I could shadow him at work. Sitting in the corner exam room chair, I was struck by how my dad’s empathy and professionalism cultivated comfort and trust in his patients. With their confidence, my dad empowered his patients to make difficult decisions and take control of their health. Here, it was clear that through their years of training and wealth of knowledge, doctors have the power to give people second chances by educating and inspiring them to make positive changes to their own lives. While I may not have realized it consciously at the time, that summer is when I first decided I wanted to follow in my dad’s footsteps.

Medicine is more than just hard science; that’s a good thing because for me, science always seemed hard. Despite my best efforts, my first two years of college were marred by academic mediocrity caused by an inability to focus. This adversity challenged my resolve to become a doctor. I realized I was at a crossroads and my dreams of becoming a physician would be over if I didn’t figure out how to overcome my attention difficulties. The summer after my sophomore year, I was diagnosed with ADHD and began seeing a doctor who helped me find a sustainable long-term solution to manage my attention challenges. After making a few adjustments to decrease distractions and increase focus, my academic performance improved significantly and I realized this was my second chance. Empowered by my doctor, I reclaimed agency over my attention difficulties and began performing at an ability that matched my effort. 

While hard science is only one component of medicine, it is a crucial piece that constantly challenges, questions, and innovates. In early 2019, I began working in a research lab that used stem cells to study retinal development. Drawing upon my own experiences with chemical imbalances in the brain, I immediately gravitated toward a project focused on neuronal regeneration. Working in research taught me how scientific discovery could be challenging and slow at times. I’ve lost track of the number of late nights spent troubleshooting with my lab mates, followed by early mornings setting up experiments to test our ideas. I’ve been fortunate to work with colleagues who helped me maximize my productivity and arrive at solutions I may never have considered on my own. With the help of a great team, I finished my master’s degree on time amid a global pandemic. My experiences in research further cemented my desire to become a physician and resulted in a tool that has the potential to restore permanently lost ganglion cells in patients with glaucoma. 

To gain a deeper understanding of the clinical side of medicine, I began working as an ophthalmic tech at Rady Children’s Hospital after completing my master’s degree. There, I met 17-year-old Mateo, who came in for an annual eye exam before starting college. As was common practice with teenagers, he was asked to complete the PHQ-9, a questionnaire to evaluate mental health well-being. Upon seeing his results, it became evident that he was experiencing a mental health crisis. When the doctor came to help, her warm kindness gave Mateo a sense of security to confide in her without fear of judgment when he otherwise felt alone in his battle with depression. Her caring approach helped me realize that the practice of medicine takes place in many forms. I already knew the value of compassion in healthcare, but it was here that I realized how doctors could help patients in unexpected ways. While patients are at the heart of medicine, doctors are the heart in medicine. As someone who has experienced and overcome my own internal challenges, I want to become a physician to give patients the ability to reclaim control over their health without fear of stigma.

Through my time serving patients and as a patient myself, I am fortunate to have gained a new perspective on medicine that I will apply myself as a doctor. My vague medical school dreams quickly came into focus when my potential to become a physician was challenged. The adversity I overcame revealed both my resilience and capacity for improvement. While my initial goal of giving patients a second chance never wavered, I now have a fuller understanding of what that objective actually entails. Beginning from an early age, I saw how compassion, trust, and empathy were central to medicine. As my experience grew, I also learned that doctors have a crucial responsibility to serve others as both teachers and patient advocates. I now also understand that a doctor's capacity for service increases when they collaborate with others. The doctors who worked with me to enhance my mental and physical health affected the course of my life for the better. I am thankful to have been given a second chance to fulfill my dreams and will work tirelessly to do the same for my patients.","Working in healthcare taught me that non-English speakers often face compromised quality of care. Here, sensitivity to the specific needs of each patient is paramount. For example, Hila, an Afghan refugee, was a recent immigrant who spoke no English. When communicating with patients like Hila, I utilized an interpreter through which I worked to establish a sense of comfort and trust._x000D_
_x000D_
In the past, I‚Äôve seen patients like Hila wrongly labeled as ‚Äúpoor historians‚Äù due to their limited English. Hila‚Äôs visit required empathy and compassion, but it was clear she appreciated the care I took to ensure the quality of her exam despite the language barrier. While each patient offers a unique challenge, they also bring a particular perspective that, in the future, I will be mindful of with my patients. As a doctor, I may never fully understand each patient‚Äôs lived experiences. However, I can still exercise empathy and compassion with an awareness that diverse patients have diverse needs.","When I coached the UC San Diego Climbing Team, I helped athletes reach their potential by fortifying their weaknesses and building upon their strengths. During this time, I mentored aspiring athletes who loved climbing but struggled to overcome a fear of heights that kept them from reaching their potential.

To empower these climbers to push their mental limits, I taught them how to fall safely and provided opportunities to practice falling in a controlled environment without judgment._x000D_

By giving constructive feedback through an empathetic lens, I helped these climbers push their mental limits to gain self-confidence in all aspects of their life.

It was not until I was sitting in the doctor’s office one day waiting for my mom’s appointment to hurry and finish that my vision of her was crushed. I jerked my head up abruptly when the word “cancer” left the doctor’s mouth; it couldn’t be true. No matter how hard the doctor tried to reassure me that my mom would be okay after a complete nephrectomy, it still did not make any sense to me and left me afraid of what was to come. Though I left the doctor’s office bawling in the car the rest of the ride home, the fear of losing my mom sparked my curiosity in medicine, motivating me towards becoming an empathetic physician who provides care for individuals during their most fearful moments.
I felt powerless being unable to physically do anything to alleviate my mother’s pain as she underwent major surgery. In an attempt to understand how my mother’s sickness came to be my reality, I delved into summer health programs to deepen my medical knowledge and expand on what school taught me. At Stanford’s cardiothoracic surgical internship, I learned the fatal impacts of coronary artery disease and how to treat these individuals by performing a coronary artery bypass graft on a pig’s heart. Cutting through the thick muscle and completing each step of a surgical procedure, I could not help but think about my mom’s surgery. I felt empowered to hopefully someday carry the same responsibility as a surgeon. I aspire to provide my skills and knowledge to instill hope in patients, whose diagnoses may have left them in the same confused and frightened position as it once did for my mom.
My passion to support vulnerable populations was further motivated when I became a crisis text line counselor. My role included supporting individuals across the country during their most difficult moments, guiding them to a calmer headspace, and providing a listening ear so that they would not feel alone. A particular conversation that stuck with me was with “Sara,” a mother who had recently lost her baby. On top of coping with this loss, she also struggled with an abusive partner who blamed her for the miscarriage. Throughout our conversation, Sara constantly apologized for sending long text messages. Despite everything she was enduring, she was afraid of burdening others including me. While I could not begin to imagine the pain she was experiencing, I knew that she should not have to grieve alone. I validated her emotions and continued to remind her of her strengths that brought her up to that point. As a crisis counselor, I have enjoyed providing support for those who have been through tremendous hardship like Sara. I hope to be in a position where I can be there for people who need healing, both physically and emotionally.
Though I gained valuable skills from my experiences in summer programs and memorable encounters from meaningful conversations on the crisis text line platform, I have never felt more confident in my path towards becoming a physician until I began working with patients as a medical scribe. I recall following Dr. F into the clinical room where I met “Jane” for the first time sitting with tear-filled eyes. As the full body skin check began, I noticed scars on Jane’s chest and missing fingers on her hand that were a result of malignant melanoma and metastatic breast cancer. I observed Jane’s eyes full of fear from another impending, unwanted diagnosis that would leave yet another permanent scar on her body. As Dr. F approached, I could not help but notice Jane’s small reflexive flinches. All the trauma endured by her body and mind had left her with so much fear and anxiety. Seeing Jane in tears, I was reminded of my twelve year old self crying uncontrollably during my mom’s diagnosis. I approached and consoled Jane, giving her a tissue to wipe her tears and momentarily relax from the appointment. She released a sigh that may have been of relief as the doctor informed her that no concerns were noted during today’s visit. Jane’s scars and evident fear as well as Dr. F’s consolation and reassurance during the exam showed me how important it was to acknowledge the pain that individuals go through. I hope to comfort patients and alleviate their fear by making efforts to understand what they have been through in their past medical histories and personal lives and treating them in a personal manner accordingly. 
As a daughter, summer surgical intern, crisis counselor, and scribe, I was constantly reminded of the power that sickness holds in its ability to radiate fear and feelings of loneliness for patients, such as Jane and my mom, and their loved ones like me. These fearful emotions have constantly pushed me into wanting to be directly involved in not only counseling and providing treatment for patients but also being there for them emotionally in order to alleviate the stress and pain caused by such fear from sickness. I hope to provide an outlet for fear for every patient that I encounter as a physician and I aspire to be someone who will give their all to support every individual as a medical professional.","A life experience that broadened my worldview was tutoring Syrian refugee students in English through Paper Airplanes. While teaching English to help these students continue their education, I have learned so much about global affairs and health disparities present in their home countries. I have heard about dangers like bombs destroying their homes and refugee camps being unbearably hot. Sharing meaningful conversations with my students has been so important to me. It has not only shown me how different circumstances are around the world but has also reinforced my passion for practicing medicine globally and helping victims in underserved countries and communities. Students who have acted as first responders to bombings have seen some of the most tragic things, yet they still show up with a smile to our sessions and are ready to learn. Though I may have had the teaching role, I have learned so much about resilience through my students and am inspired to continue to serve them.","While volunteering at Silverado Hospice, I met many residents whom I was able to share meaningful interactions with.

Some days I would spend floating around the facility to speak with other residents like ‚ÄúMary,‚Äù who shared her love for animals and showed me the horses the facility had. Many residents loved sharing their stories and knowledge with me, and I enjoyed listening to them. Speaking with the residents and their visiting family members has helped me realize how important it is for the residents to know that they are cared for during their last few years of life.

My mother grew up in an old-fashioned Spanish family. Her father was the provider and her mother took care of the home. When sent off to college, her mother insisted she find a wealthy man to marry, as she was also destined to be a housewife. Despite these discouraging remarks, she was driven to succeed and eventually became an executive at one of the largest financial companies in the country. She is my idol, influencing the strong, driven woman I am today. Despite her struggles, her successes gave me the chance to pursue an excellent education. This opportunity evolved into shadowing and working for multiple healthcare workers, hence defining my passion for medicine. 
	My mother’s story inspires me to be my best self and pursue an arduous career of my own. I discovered the magic of science as I excelled in classes like Anatomy and Physiology. I also joined a research lab, where I plan to publish my senior thesis on the topic of gecko adhesion as a possible framework for bioinspired synthetic adhesives. After constant self-evaluation of my qualities and interests, I realized that as a physician I would be challenged every day, continue learning throughout my life, and acquire opportunities through meaningful research. These are all aspects I seek in a career. 
	My mother’s strength influences me to be an independent woman that works hard to obtain what I want. In doing so, I earned opportunities in both shadowing and working in healthcare, which further increased my desire to become a physician. In particular, shadowing an orthopedic surgeon inspired me, and I began to envision the idea of myself performing one of the surgeries I observed. Cartilage from a patient’s knee was grown on a dish in a separate facility and, once completed, was transplanted back into that same individual's knee. Standing bedside, I witnessed the perfect combination of research and medicine as the surgeon skillfully remodeled the knee with new technology. I remember how fascinated I was watching the surgeon, who was focused yet relaxed, change a person’s life so seamlessly. The knowledge and ease by which physicians operate using groundbreaking technology is inspiring and powerfully entices me to the medical field.
	Continuing my experiences in shadowing and working for multiple cardiologists, I recognized the value of empathy in medicine. For example, I remember one patient suffering from severe depression due to his chronic condition. I watched the doctor draw upon his personal challenges as an example to encourage the patient to keep battling because there was continued hope. By explaining to him a potential treatment, I saw the helplessness disappear from both the patient and his wife’s faces. The joy and fulfillment I experienced in that room are what I want to give to others and feel for myself every day. Each time I left work or a shadowing experience, I appreciated and enjoyed my day more than expected. I learned qualities of a good doctor one cannot learn from a textbook and now I am recognizing these qualities in myself. 
	Growing up, my mother always took me to charity events and emphasized the importance of giving back to my community. Thus, I joined a club at Villanova called “Best Buddies,” which allows students to build relationships with individuals with disabilities in the local area. In joining, I discovered a new side of myself. I found a new passion for working with disabled individuals. In continuing to build such bonds, I decided that when I am a physician, I will work towards creating an affordable community for people like those individuals I met in Best Buddies. The connection that I was able to make with “my buddies” as a small group leader emphasized the dignity of all people and opened up my heart to the unique needs of my future patients. Similar to the way my mother’s strength encouraged me, I will stand strong while supporting individuals of all differences. 
	Sensitive to all diversities, like my mother, we use our bilingual abilities to bridge gaps in our work. For instance, I found myself translating information for multiple patients in the cardiology office in hopes of bettering their healthcare experience. Specifically, one Spanish-speaking woman from Chile could not return home due to COVID restrictions. I offered to translate her appointment, and the moment I said one word to her in Spanish, I watched her eyes open up and her posture sink in relief. We ensured she understood what she needed before giving me a hug of appreciation when leaving. Having the cultural background that I do, I see firsthand how I will improve a patient’s healthcare experience as a future physician. 
	As a Hispanic woman in STEM, I recognize the opportunities given to me by my mother, making it even more vital for me to achieve what I know I can accomplish. In my annual visits to Puerto Rico, I witness many of my ethnicity who do not have the support and means that I am fortunate to have. My mother’s strengths elevated me to the reality of becoming a physician. Now as a strong woman, my awareness of cultural and physical differences, sensitivity to equity and love for science will shape me into becoming a strong doctor.","I was part of Best Buddies, which focused on building relationships with individuals with disabilities. The time I spent with my buddies increased my awareness and empathy for those different than me. I became more aware of the many different disabilities that exist, increasing my sensitivity towards all people. I learned how to communicate more effectively, both verbally and physically, showing my compassion towards the hardships these individuals face. For example, I was able to comfort and understand the needs of those buddies who were unable to speak. With a grab of my hand, I was able to decipher what they were trying to communicate. Additionally, I was able to develop my communication skills in that I could effectively communicate our rules or expectations in a sensitive way. My overall appreciation for the strength and resilience of my buddies inspires me every day, shifting my focus from disabilities and disadvantages to abilities and advantages.","The office I work in is located in a town with a large Hispanic population. I am often able to use my skills to translate for my Spanish speaking patients and relate to them in their appointments. I encounter Spanish speaking patients at least once a day, and when I speak with them, I find that their tone changes completely. They become more talkative and seem to feel relief to talk to me directly rather than through a translator. I believe that in being able to communicate directly with the patient as the healthcare worker changes their medical experience because the visit becomes a conversation. The patient is able to explain their story and symptoms, while I respond based off those stories. The patient knows that the healthcare worker is hearing their statements firsthand. Things can often get lost in translation, so being able to communicate with the patient in their first language makes their experience more personal and reassuring.  ",,,1,"In 2019, I was offered the chance to shadow surgeons for three weeks in Spain with the Atlantis Fellowship.

On the other hand, with the start of the pandemic, many offices were seeking staff to keep their offices safe while continuing in-person care. I was fortunate enough to be hired as a medical screener for Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia, gaining a full-time paid experience in healthcare. This job was beneficial not only because I was able to find employment in a time where it proved to be difficult, but also because it allowed me to gain future opportunities with the same company. Thus, while the pandemic brought many hardships, it also presented me with opportunities I may not have had otherwise.",0,0,2

After the separation, my mom and I translocated to rural Texas. Since my mom worked minimum wage jobs, we lived with extended family and utilized food stamps and WIC while receiving healthcare through Medicaid. In grade school, my mom and I moved to League City, TX to live with my grandparents to avoid homelessness. Due to the need for money and healthcare, my mother decided to rejoin the military. While my mom was in basic for two months, my sister and I lived with my grandmother. At Fort Benning, GA my mom met my stepfather and we moved to Washington D.C which further disrupted my educational experiences. Due to a lack of resources and an unsafe environment in D.C. public schools, my stepfather took a job with the United States Embassy and we moved to Poland for high school. Because of continuing financial difficulties I worked during high school to offset the cost of extracurricular activities, which took time away from college preparations.

For my first case as a medical advocate, before my senior year, I drove an hour out of the city to a newly built hospital in the rural outskirts of Georgia. As I entered the room, I was met with a smile and a joke from a young girl wrapped in a blanket. I smiled and made a quick joke back. But I was nervous if I could handle the accompanying responsibilities and properly support the survivors. Thankfully, I quickly learned how to navigate through difficult situations and conversations. I became an active listener and directed interactions to best facilitate patient support. As I took on more cases, I watched the physicians move through the procedures with medical expertise in a supportive, sensitive manner. Over time, I realized that I wanted to be the leader at the bedside providing the medical knowledge and support that comes only with being a physician. 
My past work in sociology has allowed me to understand the person behind the patient and provided me the tools to become a better advocate. After losing two friends to heroin overdoses during my sophomore year, I was desperately searching for answers that sociology was able to provide. I learned how important it was to recognize that a patient is more than an illness and to take into consideration environmental and social contexts when providing treatment. As a research assistant involved in a sociological study, I explored social and health determinants more intricately and began to realize how deeply accessibility is intertwined with the ways in which people seek health. 
My volunteer work as an undergraduate expanded my awareness of this topic and allowed me to gain valuable insight into the healthcare system. I worked with refugees, immigrants, and women in shelters helping them navigate the system by assisting them with enrolling in ACA, Medicaid, and Medicare. As a child recipient of Medicaid, I was able to connect my experiences to those I was helping and engage with them on a deeper level. I saw firsthand the difficulties of figuring out and applying to the system, and how this exacerbated the stress felt by the people that it was designed to help. These experiences allowed me to see the gaps in healthcare, determine things I could do to address those shortcomings, and ultimately furthered my understanding of the ways in which people interact with the medical system. 
To fulfill my interest in health and research, I decided to pursue a job as a clinical research assistant at Joslin Diabetes Center. Here I was in the epicenter of medical research and I wanted to learn all of it. Suddenly I found myself engrossed in the science behind diabetes by wanting to gain a deeper understanding of the pathology, so I started attending grand rounds and began learning the different mechanisms of the disease. I shadowed everyone I could including nurse practitioners, registered dietitians, exercise specialists, and physicians to learn how each role contributed to the patients’ diabetes management.
Through my clinical experiences, I observed the multifaceted impact that compassionate physicians have on their patients. With a financially costly and lifelong disease like diabetes, I saw the ways in which the physicians worked with different income levels and insurance types for their treatment plans. I came to understand how the physician is an integral decision-making part of a team of medical professionals. I admired the problem-solving skills that the physicians portrayed by taking mismatching pieces of information from the entire healthcare team and holistically fitting them together to form a treatment plan that was conducive to the patient’s life. This mirrored my own skills in advocacy and my experience in building support plans with survivors. I saw how those skills could successfully translate to a clinical setting, confirming my decision to become a physician. 
I am continuing my work with vulnerable populations by volunteering at a food pantry and working in healthcare research as a study coordinator for pediatric chronic kidney disease. I am understanding how physicians work with government entities and insurance companies to create innovative and cost-effective treatment tools. By conducting qualitative research with caregivers and patients, we are creating outcome measures to gauge disease progression in patients most at risk. My background in sociology has prepared me for a career in advocacy and community service, while my work in the healthcare field has shown me how research in the social and biological sciences can work together.
Throughout my experiences I have learned that the way I want to make an impact on my community is through becoming a physician. I hope to bring a holistic, research-backed approach to medicine in underserved communities by understanding the multifaceted determinants present in a patient’s life to enhance their treatment plans. My path thus far has instilled in me the determination and drive to bridge the gaps present in healthcare and the willingness to learn, research, and apply new ideas every day while providing a space for innovative patient-centered care.","As a medical advocate, I met a Nigerian woman, who wanted to meet with her spiritual healer before starting any treatment. I was shocked as it is important to receive treatment and preventive medication as soon as possible. However, she was terrified. I sat and listened to her reasoning and realized that this was her way of healing. Her healer met her at the hospital and she left. I felt like I had failed. Afterwards, I connected with her for a check-in. During this call, I came to realize the cultural significance of the healer being someone she trusted and went to for all guidance. I realized the importance of understanding a patient‚Äôs culture and how they choose to seek health. After this experience, the way that I approached advocacy situations changed. I asked questions about the ways in which people sought care previously and I chose to meet them where they were to ensure that they were receiving the best quality of care and that it was respecting all aspects of their beliefs.","As the president of my community living house in college, I established an annual fundraiser that worked in collaboration with two other houses on campus, where we made wellness bags for women and children in a local shelter. Over a two month period, we organized numerous talks from the people who ran the shelters and the women living in the shelters. During these talks, we would fundraise by taking monetary or physical donations such as sanitary products and toys. Next, we held a campus wide event that allowed for people to pack bags for the women and children. Through holding this fundraiser we not only provided necessities, self-care, and fun items for the women and children, but also brought awareness to the shelter and increased the number of people from our campus who volunteered on a weekly basis. This fundraiser and relationship with the shelter has continued on since my graduation.",,,1,"I began my premedical postbac program in June 2020. The transition from a full time job in Boston, where I had a large support system, to a full time student in a new place was difficult. Classes were hybrid with a portion of the class coming in at different times following precautions, which was necessary but made it difficult to integrate into the community. Additionally, professors held office hours over zoom which led to further difficulty in trying to ask questions. These experiences forced me to explore new and innovative ways to learn and study, which overall helped me become a better student.",1,1,2

I now reflect that these gestures patched holes in the tourist pamphlet version Berkshire County; Hidden behind arts and outdoor recreation, Berkshire County consistently ranks in the lowest percentiles of health outcomes in the Commonwealth, driven by socioeconomic and access challenges, and high rates of comorbidity, opioid use, obesity, and smoking. Shadowing local physicians I witnessed the unending work and dedication required of healthcare providers to navigate understaffing and limited resources endemic to rural medicine. While scribing overnight in the Emergency Department, I overheard a salient quotation from older gentleman in the ED: “I get sick, I come in, I get a little better with you guys. I leave but can’t get off the street to really heal and rest. So, I’m back.” In directly interacting with patients, I sensed, but did not yet grasp, the underlying factors of a cycle of readmissions.

I knew I wanted to pursue a career in medicine when I left for Williams College. While I progressed in my chemistry and biology courses, social sciences laid bare the roles that race, class and environment play in Berkshire County. My focus on social determinants of health and community health then consumed my academic interests. I took classes on how power structures impact care and diagnosis in the United States as well as classes on the cultural underpinnings of death and dying. One of my mentors in the Berkshire is and was a practicing clinician and director of community health. I was struck by the rewarding balance that these two aspects of care generated. 

The opportunity to intern outside of Berkshire County at Brigham and Women's added new dimensions to this balance. There, I  focused on cardiovascular outcomes and maintained a patient registry for lupus patients, which exposed me to new populations and study design. I grasped how similar tools could be applied to assess and drive changes back home. 
My time at Williams had challenged me as an individual, friend, academic and leader. With debt to several incredible peers and professors, I expanded my healthcare knowledge and focused my interests on community health and the social determinants of health. From freshman novice to captain of the Williams rowing team, I led 50 athletes to a tremendous fall season. My peers at Williams drove me to become a more conscientious member of my community, a more selfless leader, and a more developed student. 

Graduating into the pandemic, I was invited back to Brigham and Women’s Hospital by Dr. Karen Costenbader and Dr. Daniel Solomon, both of whom have been very generous mentors. I immersed myself in learning about clinical conditions, primarily rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis and treatment. I drafted research protocols, recruited patients, conducted study visits, analyzed results, and wrote my own manuscript based on the quality improvement project I oversaw.  I am currently managing three studies focused on autoimmune disease including sequelae associated with COVID-19 as well as immunogenicity and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients post-COVID-19 vaccination. I have conducted close to 200 study visits and have been fortunate to be a co-author on seven manuscripts and abstracts. Within these clinical research experiences, I am most energized by the patient interaction. I love hearing about the importance of roll-on sunscreen for lupus patients, or how a participant’s children are navigating virtual kindergarten.  

Endurance cycling emerged during the pandemic as my unexpected passion and source of balance: I love finding time to ride out of Boston to country roads, checking in on what the best sandwich place is with the locals and finding new places to explore. Each of these journeys further strengthen my commitment to community as I spin through myriad snapshots of small-town life. Through directly experiencing the health challenges of rural life, studying the impact of social determinants of health, developing clinical research skills, and joining community efforts to repair health and healthcare, I have built a strong foundation to lean on as a clinician. I want to pursue a speciality like primary care that allows for a dynamic approach to medicine at both the individual patient and macro community level. I aspire to connect these joys, to lead a vote to pave new bike lanes which could begin to address the structural gaps in care, to take Saturday mornings to ride with patients, as physician, engaged community leader, thoughtful clinical researcher, and neighbor.","I reflect often on a moment when I was 14 and washing dishes at a local caf√© that shaped the way I approach any social situation. It was my first summer job and first day of work, and the dishes were piled up as the lunch rush hit. The cook, Ali, a twinkly eyed man from C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, came up to me and gave me a big pat on the back. He said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs knock these out, then you come join us for lunch.‚Äù We washed the rest and he cooked me a burger. He made me feel like part of the team. I try to emulate Ali as I know how much of a difference it can make. By no means am I perfect, but I always strive to do this in athletics, classes, work, and with friends. At my college graduation, my rowing coach told me that I was elected captain my senior year was because the team believed I could make every member feel important. That moment was particularly sweet, as I knew I had succeeded in making others feel the way I did in that kitchen.That is what I hope to bring to Rush.","I grew up in a medically underserved area of Western Massachusetts. This is an area that is relatively hard to navigate, with little public transportation and relatively sparse social services and resources to aid individuals outside of the hospital. I saw while scribing in the emergency department how hard it is for patients to navigate existing hospital and community resources. I had the opportunity to return to Berkshire Medical and work alongside the director of community engagement at the hospital. As part of this effort, I worked to create a list of free resources and community groups in the Berkshires that could help address different needs and worked with the system to publish this resources list around so providers and other community members could easy contact these resources. Local providers at the hospital still use this resources list and I hope it has been able to address some of the social determinants of health for patients outside of the hospital.",,,1,"I finished Williams virtually in Spring 2020 in Western Massachusetts. My job at Brigham and Women's was postponed until September and I started work in a hybrid environment in the Fall. I did not meet many of my team members in person until the Spring.

Thankfully, I have had great mentorship and support from my primary investigators during the pandemic and we have navigated many research related challenges like clinic shutdowns and exposure protocols. We have had several successful research studies related to COVID and I have conducted over 200 study visits, learning a little more about each patient's experience in the pandemic and their life in general at each one, but the pandemic has certainly shifted my experience away from a traditional clinical research experience in many ways.",1,1,2

I was always taught that doctors had ulterior motives, and they were far from the altruistic, caring image they were portrayed to be. My dad would always talk about how big pharma pushed doctors to care more about profits than patients. My mom would doubt every medication prescribed to us. When my grandma passed away, my parents blamed it on her physician’s negligence, rather than her own poor health. 

This mistrust was not borne from nothing. Historical maltreatment, experimentation and neglect all have led to a pervasive distrust of the medical field. Understanding the historical background between my and so many other family’s mistrust in medicine was what first truly drove me to consider a career as a physician. But what first piqued my interest as a child was my Uncle. 

As an E.R. physician, and the only doctor my family knew personally, my Uncle was my first glimpse of the ability doctors have to improve the relationship between medical professionals and those who have been historically harmed by them. My Uncle constantly fielded questions from anxious relatives. He listened, empathized, and explained anxiety-inducing treatment plans or diagnoses in ways that we could understand. Most of all, he encouraged us to be honest with our primary care providers. Even off the clock, my Uncle demonstrated the power physicians have to mend the relationship between mistrustful patients and their healthcare providers. 

In college, I began seriously exploring the medical field and what a career as a physician would be like. My first position was as a patient transporter in an emergency department, where I was able to spend time with patients and families while transporting them throughout the hospital. Once I had a homeless patient, and while taking him to X-ray he spoke to me about his struggles with alcoholism and withdrawal. I remember I could barely hear the words he was saying, his voice was so quiet. He told me how he felt embarrassed to be homeless and panhandling, leaving him dependent on others in order to survive. He said he felt like his kids were ashamed of him, but he finally felt motivated to get better. To even listen and be an ear for someone who needs help feels good. To feel like you’ve made a positive impact on someone’s life and health is fulfilling. 

As a transporter, I learned to adapt to each patient’s needs. But even more, my seat near the nursing station gave me a window to how healthcare professionals speak and act out of view. No matter what a patient had been admitted for, their doctors and nurses would always speak about their condition with compassion and discretion. My uncle’s empathy and drive first gave me hope that the relationship between marginalized groups and their healthcare providers could be improved, but volunteering in a hospital and seeing that same empathy persist fostered that. 

Then, I began working as a nursing unit secretary. In this position, I was able to better see the amount and work and coordination, often across multiple departments, needed to care for a patient. I also experienced some of the frustrating aspects of healthcare. On top of a full unit, we often had to navigate patients who were sun-downing, experiencing withdrawal, or had angry family members, on top of complex medical problems. No matter how tedious it may have seemed, I continued to see doctors take time to de-escalate situations, adjust treatment plans, and solve complex issues. 

Every position in a healthcare team is integral to successful care, but my interest in becoming a physician specifically was driven by their breadth of knowledge, and their ability to manage and direct patient care. 

One of my first times sitting for a patient was for an E.R. admission, transferred to a gynecology oncology floor. She was admitted for rib pain, after being assaulted while walking home. While in the E.R., it was discovered that she had an S.T.I., which she had gotten from a sexual partner she thought she had an exclusive relationship with. She had a history of sexual trauma and abuse, and recently her best friend passed away. She required a sitter because she was experiencing suicidal ideation and experiencing severe panic attacks. 

A hospital admission puts someone in a vulnerable position. In order to access the care they need, a person has to repeatedly divulge personal information. But every physician listened attentively, and though her initial complaint– rib pain– was swallowed up by more serious problems, it was readdressed and assessed before discharge. 

Once more, I was able to witness how meaningful the relationship between a physician and their patient can be. Mental health resources were made available to this patient, and upon discharge she had a plan to ensure both her mental and physical health would be taken care of.   

Though the medical field may have a darker past, things have improved, and they will continue to do so as time goes on. Becoming a physician will allow me to play a direct role in improving the relationship between those who have been historically harmed by the medical field, while also advancing science and contributing to the body of work that we use to treat and care for them.","Growing up as a first-generation American allowed me to be raised in an environment that taught me to be understanding of diverse backgrounds. This was put into practice throughout my life, including when I worked as a patient safety sitter. _x000D_
_x000D_
One patient had been admitted after being assaulted. She had lived her entire life in the city, whereas I grew up in the county. I grew up in a safe home, but she had to deal with abusive family her entire life. She needed a sitter because she had been struggling with suicide ideation. _x000D_
_x000D_
This situation was my first time directly witnessing how difficult it can be to access medical care. This patient had been trying to better manage her mental health, but barriers prevented her from accessing resources. This experience enhanced my ability to understand those unlike myself because I was an ear for a patient who‚Äôd had a completely different upbringing. It taught me that part of being an effective physician is helping patients access needed resources","Education, and access to high-quality education, has always been important to me. Growing up, I was blessed to attend well-funded schools. The fact that many people in my family and community did not have this same luxury, made me very appreciative of the opportunities I had access to. I understand how much my education has done for me, from a full-scholarship to college, to how prepared I was for my courses, so I‚Äôll always take advantage of opportunities to pass on what I‚Äôve been given. An example of this would be the time I spent as a tutor for a student with a disability during the COVID-19 pandemic. Her school became fully remote, and she had started falling behind. I was offered the opportunity to work with her 1:1 to help keep her on track throughout the rest of the school year. In the time we had together, I was able to work with her, her mom and her teacher to address her weaknesses, and I‚Äôm proud that she was able to finish the year with good grades and more confidence.",,,1,"One major disruption I experienced was a difficulty in finding shadowing experiences. I relied on local practices and hospitals, however, most clinical settings understandably disallowed shadowing._x000D_
_x000D_
I adapted by participating in virtual shadowing. Although this was different from traditional shadowing, I was still able to learn about various medical specialties and professions from different backgrounds, and the role they play in quality patient care. Rather than be restricted to providers based in my own state, I was able to gain a better understanding of how state and regional lines impact healthcare. _x000D_
_x000D_
Another major disruption was losing the job that had been my primary source of income, due to pandemic related closures. However, I simultaneously worked in other positions that could transition to be fully remote.

Let’s oxidize methoxybenzyl alcohol to methoxybenzaldehyde with bleach, but there is a problem: how can we get the nonpolar alcohol to react with the polar bleach? That’s where Tetrabutyl-ammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBAS) comes in. While TBAS may be limited to a necessary phase-transfer-catalyst in the organic chemistry lab, in the real world, TBAS are personified as physicians. I have another acronym for TBAS: Toddler Builder Acrobat Servant. Developing the grit of a toddler, the vision of a builder, the work ethic of an acrobat, and the humility of a servant has motivated me to be a catalyst-like physician.

Toddler’s display resilience as they try to walk, often falling and crying, but getting right back up. In Fall 2020, I withdrew from my organic chemistry course because I did not have the learning style needed for success in a rigorous online course. I fell flat on my face and thought I was not cut out to be pre-med. I questioned why I wanted to be a doctor and the answer was straight forward: I want to be like those who I look up to. They are superheroes disguised as human physicians saving families in their communities with unwavering devotion. Motivated, like a toddler determined to walk, I got up. I resolved that success requires an adaptable discipline and put in time to make deeper connections in my learning. As a physician, I will remain flexible and steadfast to overcome challenges.

Builders make infrastructure, like bridges, to connect individuals to this global society. Just like a catalyst, physicians bridge the scientific community and the public. Without this bridge, there would be no societal benefit. As a tutor for underserved K-12 students, I taught subject matters from basic English to Electrochemistry and Calculus. I learned that converting highly sophisticated knowledge into simple, comprehensible lessons is uplifting to the learner and teacher. I practiced this in the clinical setting as I consented pediatric patients and their families into advanced emergency trials to improve patient outcomes. I presented scientific language in a digestible way, giving them the power of understanding. My aim in medicine is to provide top quality health care that improves patient outcomes, comprehension, and comfort through the communication skills I gained through teaching.

Acrobats do many things, of which my favorite is juggling. My greatest attempt and success was in Summer 2021. I received a research internship at Houston Methodist where I studied outcomes following orotracheal intubation in ICU patients with right ventricular dysfunction for 50 hours a week. In addition, I worked as a scribe in the COVID packed ED for minority communities for 24 hours a week. On top of that, the Divine Brain Trust (a place that makes students ideal global citizens by studying the world’s cultures) selected me as their lead mentor to manage 50+ youth with the brand-new online and social distancing format. While being a son, brother, best friend, role-model, etc. I worked diligently and strategically to give my undivided attention to all opportunities I had taken on. During this time, I gained a valuable lesson on teamwork. I was trained in school that I had to do all the work if I wanted the group project to receive an A, but I was wrong. When faced with real challenges, like managing 25 COVID patients at once during the Delta surge or finding ways to engage teens through a small square block on Google Meets, one must collaborate and be open to others’ ideas. With the help of other acrobats, one can juggle many responsibilities whether in patient care or creative projects. By the summer end, I finished collecting the data for the major publication, gained the respect of several ED physicians, and developed such engaging ways to study the world’s histories and philosophies that the group had grown! I am ready to efficiently juggle my growing responsibilities and look forward to working with an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals for the united goal of healing.

Serving my community through uplifting youth through knowledge and sports, organizing blood drives, giving hand sanitizers/masks to those in need, coordinating multi-school fundraisers for charities like Ronald McDonald Housing and American Heart Association, distributing the vaccine, etc. has many benefits. One benefit is that it humbles me. For about a year, I voluntarily managed the front desk of a bustling ER. One Friday afternoon, a sobbing mother came running in speaking Spanish while holding an empty chewy vitamins bottle and pointing to her autistic son. I tried to help her but was unsuccessful. The experience taught me that learning languages so I can empathize and deescalate situations is a helpful tool and motivated me to learn Spanish. I am eager to add medical expertise to my toolset to uplift impoverished communities. As a result, I look forward to being humbled and in turn learning ways to improve myself.

I want to be a physician because I want to be The Best At Service (TBAS) and am capable to be a real phase-transfer-catalyst since I have the perseverance of a toddler, the tools of a builder, the daring of an acrobat, and the heart of a servant.","After 5 shifts, managing a busy nonprofit ED‚Äôs patient influx became like clockwork and my mind engaged in its favorite past time: people watching.

2023,15402989,,24,Woman,USA,1,EO2,0,1,"My family immigrated to the U.S. to end a cycle of poverty. Due to licensure requirements, my father, an accountant, was unable to continue; further, financial hardship forced my mother to withdraw from nursing school in India. As a result, they labored as the maid service at a motel in South Hill, VA. My parents, brother, and I all shared a single motel room and relied on governmental aid for food. I attended schools that lacked the primary resources for fostering a career in higher education. My high school performed below the state average in all subjects and over half the students were on free/reduced lunch. To assist financially, I worked to bring in supplemental income from the age of fifteen. Although balancing academics, extracurriculars, and employment harbored many challenges, it has made me stronger in the face of uncertainty and adversity. Additionally, my family’s immigration status led to avoiding medical care and governmental programs, even in times of crisis. This has only further motivated me to pursue a career in medicine. My experiences have illustrated the significance of advocacy and accessible healthcare for marginalized communities and families experiencing similar obstacles. As a physician, I want to deliver high-quality and equitable healthcare to all patients in the community.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,4423,625.0,500.0,228.0,1050.0,195.0,1,728,1,1745,05/19/2022,University of Florida,Psychology w/ Behavioral &amp; Cognitive Neuroscience,0,,Yes,No,Yes,"Less than $25,000",5,1,1,1,65.0,25.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,25,Exceptional,4,2023,2,4.0,0.5,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"Sweat was running down my face as I ran frantically from my opponent. I felt a tap on my shoulder, “Tag! You’re it!” Quickly turning around, I attempted to chase my friend across the playground. The next thing I knew, I was lying down in the school infirmary and picked up by my mom to go to my pediatrician’s office. My pediatrician walked in and mumbled a diagnosis unfamiliar to my mom’s broken English. With my naive mind and minimal knowledge of medical terms, I translated and told her that the doctor thinks I may have a condition called asthma and that we needed to see a lung specialist soon. I did not know what that meant, but I was incredibly scared.
 
The following week, I walked to another medical office that reeked of disinfectant. Sensing my fear, Dr. B, a pulmonologist, knelt to my level and explained to me that the 2x2 glass cage was a plethysmograph and it was going to help him see how he can help me breathe better. Consolidating my fears, I followed his instructions to step inside, and I was soon diagnosed with asthma. Dr. B taught me how to use an inhaler and also educated my mom about the disease in Gujarati, the language we in spoke at home. When she informed Dr. B of our financial situation, he handed her a round, purple inhaler and a month’s supply of medicine, all free of cost, as well as affordable options for nebulizer machines. Dr. B revealed to me the capacity medicine has to change people’s lives and the role a physician has in health education, culturally competent care, and advocacy. As the nebulizer found a new residence on my nightstand and my breathing became effortless, I knew then and there that I wanted to have healing magic just like Dr. B. I knew that this is the type of physician I wanted to become.

As I grew older, I noticed that the rest of my family did not have the same access to care and concept of medicine as I did. My mom was laying on the couch next to me when I heard the same wheezing I once heard in my lungs years before. Lecturing my mom on how she should see a doctor brought me to a harsh reality. Due to my family’s immigration status, they could not receive health insurance, and paying out of pocket was not feasible. In 2018, my mother was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis which had left her lungs scarred. I could not help but think her condition could have been less serious if she had the access to the care she needed earlier. Watching my mother’s health diminish due to lack of access had an unfavorable impression on me. However, watching her health flourish due to her physicians advocating for her to acquire the treatment she needed had an even greater favorable impression on me. Her primary care physician detected the change in her health and referred her to a rheumatologist who was able to give her a definitive answer. From medications to doctor visits, I began to see her health transform before my eyes. She was no longer in so much pain that it was difficult to open a jar. Her physicians were able to give her her life back. This further reiterated my motivation to pursue medicine. I knew I was on the right path.

Upon entering college, I wanted to help families, similar to mine, receive healthcare and also gain a deeper understanding of the medical field. Accordingly, I started volunteering weekly at my university’s free clinic. During one of my volunteer shifts, I met Mr. J who informed me that he was recently laid off, did not have health insurance, was jumping between shelters, and that this was his last hope to get better, so he could start working again. I didn't have the knowledge to know what was medically wrong with him, but it was visibly clear that he was unwell. The following day during my routine follow-up calls, Mr. J answered, and I asked how he was feeling, to which he stated that he was in the hospital. I sat frozen as he continued, “I have colon cancer, the doctor at the clinic told me to go to the ER.” Although I was pleased that Mr. J was able to receive help, I was more so frustrated by my limitations as a volunteer. I wanted to do more than collect vitals and intake, I wanted to directly provide the care he needed. I knew I wanted to help in ways that only a physician can. As a physician, I want to heal patients and address these issues directly by volunteering my time and finding ways for free clinics to receive more funding for preventative resources. I am driven to heal my community and serve them to my highest potential.

My journey to medicine started with my family, but it didn’t stop there. Each step has paved my path to becoming a physician and advocate for those who have fallen through the cracks of the healthcare system. I hope by taking care of my patients I can recognize the public health issues within and work with organizations to form new and effective health policies. My experiences have revealed to me the impact that physicians have in transforming people’s lives with advanced medicine, delivering culturally competent care, and being an advocate. I will not be satisfied with anything less than having full responsibility for their care, so I can do everything in my power to spread a little bit of healing magic to those that need it.","When I hear the term, immigrant, I‚Ä¶_x000D_

I assured the mother that our clinic does not discriminate based on immigration status. After her visit, I put up signs in English and Spanish to inform patients that they may seek care regardless of their refugee, asylum, or immigration status.

In January 2020 I began learning lab techniques, but in March, my research was canceled until fall. Due to COVID-19, I did not get to spend as much valuable time gaining research skills to contribute to the evolution of medicine as I would have liked. Additionally, I was hired as an ICU Scribe in February, but  I had to move back home and resign due to the 2.5-hour commute. I also had several shadowing opportunities lined up in specialties ranging from pediatrics to orthopedic surgery, but all were canceled to minimize extra exposure to COVID-19. The pandemic decreased my hours dedicated to research, clinical experiences, and shadowing, but I was able to attain them later through outlets that did not increase the risk of spreading the virus.",1,1,3

The word “Darryl” is a derogatory term used in the San Diego urban EMS system to describe people of the homeless community, and with it comes a negative bias of poor attitudes and markedly different patient care. Ever since I started work as an EMT, the word has bothered me as I have noticed this negative connotation. Shouldn’t we strive to eliminate negative bias in the medical field in order to provide maximum care? Shouldn’t we treat each and every patient with compassion? The change we yearn to see in society begins with the intention in our attitudes and actions; I intend to lead by example by never using hurtful and derogatory slang. My goal in entering EMS is to prepare myself to be a physician who leads with intention to provide excellent and well rounded care.

The word “intentional” first captured my attention in college and has permeated into my life today. During my time of involvement with Intervarsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF) in college, I learned that intentionality means to pursue something wholeheartedly and with purpose, whether that be a relationship, results for a lab experiment, or comprehensive patient care. As a leader of IVCF, I was faced with many challenges ranging from logistics of weekly club meetings to solving interpersonal disputes between members, and found that leadership requires a combination of intentionality and creativity. For example, when leading a small group geared towards freshmen on campus, I had to be innovative in how to attract interest in the gathering while simultaneously being intentional with the time I invested. Through trial and error I found that classes younger than me responded better to flexibility rather than rigidity of schedule, and found that students were more likely to be consistent if they were consistently followed up with by a leader. When my first small group failed, I had to restructure my plans for the small group and focus on meeting students where they were at, not only providing a community but providing stress relief through weekly art projects. Intentionally leading the students by providing a safe space and creative outlet served both the individual and the community of the club, and taught me how intentionality and creativity intertwine in the care of others. 

After graduating, I became an EMT in the hopes of gaining medical experience. As an EMT, I immersed myself in the culture of San Diego and the lives of our patients; from transporting the wealthiest of folk living in the La Jolla highlands to the people living in poverty just miles away, I began to understand the value of being intentionally compassionate to all patients. I made it a goal to intentionally engage with every patient to the best of my ability. One of our most emotionally taxing patients was a woman whose tendency to complain made it tempting to disregard her; however, with each encounter I was able to form a closer bond with this patient by wholeheartedly listening to her. With trust built between us, she felt comfortable confiding in me that her depression evolved because none of her family remained in her life. Her depression led to alcohol abuse disorder, eventually causing kidney failure, which explained her tri-weekly transport to dialysis treatment. Deciding to remain intentional in my treatment of her, I gave her some prints of my personal artwork to hang in her room, and seeing her face light up when someone finally showed her kindness is a moment I will never forget. This experience taught me that long-term treatment of a patient requires intentionally diving into their story to creatively treat their condition rather than simply evaluating the surface. 

After honing my EMT abilities as a transport medic, I moved on to become a 911 EMT with the city of San Diego. I responded to a myriad of 911 calls ranging from narcotic overdoses, to infantile drownings, to cardiac arrests. The chaos of emergency medicine challenged me to creatively think outside the box, and it solidified how crucial intentionality is for a healthcare provider. While I may not be able to have prolonged conversations with emergent patients, I am still able to offer words of comfort and respect for the patient with an attitude of compassion beyond the physical treatment we provide. My team and I recently had an encounter with a patient having an abdominal aortic aneurysm. While she begged us not to let her die, we held her hands and focused on stabilizing her, encouraging her that we were doing the best care we could. Through our coaching and our teamwork to stabilize her throughout transport, she was able to calm herself down enough to make it to the hospital without incident. Our ability to be compassionate and de-escalate the situation effectively provided patient care, both physically and emotionally. 

Over my year of EMS I meditated over the word “intentional” and how it applies to healthcare and my goals with patient care. Intentionality means meeting all patients where they’re at, listening wholeheartedly, and treating them with compassion. I strive to be the physician who is intentional with her patients and can therefore treat them more effectively.","A demographic I encounter frequently while working as an EMT in the heart of San Diego are people of foreign cultures. Engaging with such people and witnessing how different cultures have unique values of personal health has given me passion and drive to make healthcare more inclusive. For example, I once transported a woman of middle eastern descent who was in active labor; being part of a religion that values modesty, she and her husband would not consent to my male partner assessing her vaginal region. Watching her husband exercise his control over the situation was difficult for my team and I since our intention was simply to provide optimal care for his wife, however we chose to respect their culture and not infringe on its values. While other cultures are certainly different from mine, it would be unprofessional to treat someone according to the values of my culture only; I can only choose to do as much positive care as each culture allows, showing full respect for my patients. ","While volunteering at a nursing facility in high school, I had grown fond of a hard-headed and ill-mannered elderly patient who lived in loneliness and poor health. As I began to dedicate more time with this patient, they began to confide in me and a friendship was created. The last time I saw this patient, they told me ‚Äúmy wife died of cancer, my children died of cancer, and I‚Äôm dying of cancer. You are my only friend left.‚Äù That week, the patient passed away and I was left with the long-lasting impression of their words. This interaction instilled in me the importance of compassion, for without it, we are simply another care provider biding the time a patient remains in our care. Acting with compassion can make an astronomical difference to the patient, as we rarely understand the entirety of their background and what events in their past shape their present actions. Since that last interaction, I have made the conscious effort to be compassionate to every patient.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has both positively and negatively affected my journey to medical school. Along with increased precautions due to the pandemic, all shadowing opportunities I had lined up fell through indefinitely, and still remain difficult to attempt. Positively, however, I was able to find a virtual shadowing program to still interact and engage with physicians. Additionally, due to the pandemic I was able to gain a better understanding of how the healthcare field operates, since the EMS field became markedly more busy with sick patients.",1,0,1

During my first year at UCI, I witnessed the death of a close family member for the first time. While initially impacting my academics, I came to realize that I must separate the two realms of my life. I must transform this tragedy into a means of growth. The first time my family visited my grandfather after he was put on life support, we were naturally desperate and searching for any glimpse of reassurance from the physician. Instead, he was treated as if he were an object, a case, a mere pawn of one’s profession, rather than my human grandfather. My promise that day was to be more empathetic, to truly understand and care for those in need.

I had never truly understood the importance of patient-physician interaction up until that day. I now know that the way a physician communicates to his or her patients can dictate the attitude, and therefore the actions, of patients striving to improve their health. Since that day, I started to channel all my emotions to form a philosophy of medicine that would be the basis on which I would approach medicine and all my future patients. I began noting aspects from each of my experiences that would help provide the scaffolding to this philosophy. I also pondered the extent and lack of care given to those in underserved communities.

To fulfill my curiosity, I volunteered to be part of a clinical missionary trip to Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. For three weeks, I had the pleasure of working alongside numerous physicians in clinics with predominantly Spanish-speaking patients. I translated patients’ complaints, took their vitals, and directed them to the physician’s office. My initial inclination was to reassure patients that they would get better, thus developing personalized relationships; however, I realized that death, chronic pain, and bleak prognoses are innate and systemic parts of the medical field. Death and disease are realities, but at least I could reassure them they were not alone in the process. As patients communicated their complaints to me, I noticed a commonality. There was a sense of desperation and longing to be noticed and cared for in each patient. For some, it was latent underneath a stoic facade, while for others, it was blatant, but nonetheless, the need for empathy and care is an innate human trait. Regardless of how seemingly mild or unimportant, every complaint needs to be treated with empathy and complete attentiveness; ultimately, it matters not what a physician deems significant as long as it is significant to the patient.

Although my experience as a scribe demonstrated the therapeutic impact of pharmacological agents, I ultimately understood that there is a degree of humanity in each patient that cannot be addressed with medications. A patient named “Linda” came into the office with high blood pressure and was waiting for over two hours. Upon entering the room, it was clear she was distressed and that it carried into her personal life. Dr. Zand was able to transform Linda’s mood by his mere compassionate persona, listening and eventually making her laugh. As she continually came in to see Dr. Zand, I noticed she picked up on his attitude and seemed to adopt it herself. Dr. Zand’s development of a strong relationship with Linda prompted her to be more engaged in her personalized healthcare. I learned that, yes, it is essential to prescribe ace inhibitors and diuretics for hypertension; however, the most effective treatment method is one that addresses both the medical and the human, psychological components.

Volunteering at the UCI Music to Heal Program provided yet another valuable lesson on becoming more empathetic. Utilizing my 11 years of piano training in a medical setting allowed me to view medicine in a creative light. As I played Sonata in G Major by Mozart in a wing of the ICU unit, I witnessed a child slowly come out of his room to watch. Although scared at first, I saw a subtle excitement in his eyes that soon evolved into him dancing. Making certain that I consistently played at that specific wing, I came to know him very well as “David.” I even taught him how to play “Happy Birthday” on the keyboard during one of our many encounters. I felt like I truly made a difference in his well-being; it seemed as if, for a moment, David had forgotten about his ailments.

My clinical exposure, occupation as a scribe, and involvement in the Music to Heal program have substantiated my dream of becoming a physician. This passion for the medical field, my yearning to provide high quality patient-care, and my philosophy of providing holistic care are the primary reasons for my endeavoring to be a physician. I want to be a part of changing the way a patient feels. I want to make a difference. I want to show patients that they are more than just objects, more than just cases, more than just a means of income—that they are humans cared for by other humans.","When visiting a mental care facility in Paraguay as part of a medical mission trip in South America, each of us had a ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù to spend time with throughout the day. I spent my day with Denis, who was ecstatic to show me around the facility. By the end of the day, I became close to Denis, and he expressed to me how he loved that I actually listened to him. Denis taught me an important lesson that day; being a physician is more than just a career. Rather, it is an opportunity to build lasting connections with your patients, to be there for both physical and emotional support. Yet another crucial encounter occurred when serving a homeless community in Brazil. Hundreds of tents were set up surrounding a miniature church built from bricks and wooden sticks. Despite the lack of basic necessities, the community showed the epitome of kindness towards our group and each other. This taught me that especially when times are difficult, it is essential to remain comforting and compassionate.","Through my experiences serving marginalized communities such as Skid Row, I have witnessed the lack of the inclusivity of health care due to poor socioeconomic status. As Skid Row is a predominantly Black community, I am given the opportunity to serve my community whilst understanding the needs of certain underserved populations. By preparing and distributing food and care packages while building connections with individuals of this population, I believe I contributed to a larger cause, one that focuses on the well-being of the less fortunate._x000D_

I truly believe that all physicians must truly grasp how such social determinants affect health. Each patient that I see as a physician will be cared for with an understanding of their racial and economic background. Recognizing and seeking to equalize the under-representation of minorities will be one of my primary focuses as a physician.",,,1,"COVID-19 especially impacted those who were economically disadvantaged, widening the gap between the rich and the poor.

COVID-19 was a time of uncertainty, worry, and change. It underlined aspects of our nation that are flawed, especially the minimal attention given to the disadvantaged. Taking initiative and seeking out alternatives during this time was essential. Most importantly, this pandemic taught me how unexpected medicine truly is; there is a plethora of science that is yet to be unfolded. As a physician, I must handle such situations of panic with collectiveness. Lastly, I will ensure that my future patients are all accounted for, regardless of economic background.",1,0,2

Although still in my first year as a retractor holder, I am used to this from spending multiple nights on call. However, this time is different. The nurse tells me I must assist with an open craniotomy, a sophisticated surgery I had never seen, let alone assisted, in my time as a retractor holder. “Am I even allowed to do that?”, I inquire, “Where is the surgeon’s assistant?” She replies, “This is an emergency, so we have no other choice; she is in bed with the flu.” I am trembling the whole way to the hospital, my brain flooded with thoughts of doubt and the possibility of failure, but also how important it is that I maintain my composure. The time between my arrival and entering the sterile field felt as though it took seconds, and before I knew it, I found myself gazing upon a fellow human in dire need of this operation.
	I felt unprepared to take on such an immense responsibility, and the incident presented itself without warning. Taking on challenges has always been a place I excel, but in the operating room, I found myself being pushed further than I ever had before. This experience with the craniotomy, along with nearly four years of surgical experience, has solidified how much I enjoy stimulating tasks and thrive on conquering obstacles. I found that being presented with novel trials and having to acclimate quickly is something I revel in. Medicine, from what I have observed and experienced, is the ideal environment for such a challenge. Ultimately, when we overcome those tests, the patient’s quality of life can be improved. 
	Healthcare delivers trials to be overcome, and it offers endless opportunities to learn and expand knowledge. As I helped the surgeon operate on the patient’s brain during the late-night craniotomy, I was exposed to anatomy I had never seen. The pumping vessels, various layers of protection around the brain, the sections of the skull, the intricacies of the brain, both seen and unseen, and the complex techniques required to perform the operation all fascinated me. Over time, I have assisted and learned from countless surgeries, including exploratory laparotomies, laparoscopic gastric bypasses, early morning gunshot traumas, breast biopsies, spinal fusions, and various others. Every operation serves simultaneously as an opportunity to treat someone in need and increase my knowledge. In addition to working in surgery, my time shadowing taught me the importance of patient-physician relationships. I am intrigued by how each patient presents a one-of-a-kind personality that a physician must learn to navigate, utilizing the professional relationships with their peers to optimize a relationship with that patient. Something as simple as sitting at the level of the patient or neglecting to wear the white coat can make a world of difference in establishing rapport. That fascinates me. Due to these aspects, I have come to appreciate medicine as a practice. Not merely as a mastery of the human body or treatment, but as an exercise involving learning daily, dedicated to the betterment of others. 
	As we neared the end of the operation, the surgeon and I carefully resealed the patient’s skull, stapled the skin, and added fresh white dressings around the cranium. Enthralled with the intricacies experienced in my last couple of hours, and genuinely relieved as I had accomplished a task I previously believed to be beyond my skill set, I became filled with a unique feeling. Goosebumps trickled up each of my limbs, and I was nearly driven to tears. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what I felt, somewhere between joy and satisfaction. What I do know, is I only feel this way after I have put someone else before myself. When I complete a surgery, or volunteer in local community service projects through my fraternity, I know I have helped improve someone’s quality of life. When I completed my Iron Phi accomplishment, raising money and awareness for ALS research, I knew I was helping to further an entity greater than myself. When I volunteer at Missouri Boy’s State, leading and counseling young men who will one day help build the future of their community, I give younger men tools to use in their upcoming endeavors. The fact that I have been fulfilled by the impact I have helped make on others in these smaller undertakings has pushed me to take on a higher responsibility as a physician, allowing me to play an even more direct role in serving others.
As the surgeon left the room, a quick “great job” functioned as his only recognition of my work that night. To me, though, those two words told me I am capable of being the man in his position. From the drive to the hospital, to the drive home, my confidence in my ability had flipped entirely. Although the operating room would be the last place I encountered the craniotomy patient, it was far from my last instance of caring for others. Despite the many challenges I have faced in surgery, school, and life as a whole, my desire to treat patients as a physician has failed to be extinguished. In fact, my various experiences since I decided to pursue healthcare have confirmed my aspirations as a lifetime calling.","While counseling at Missouri Boys State, a camper under my supervision expressed feelings of homesickness and explained how he was struggling to find his purpose in the program. I was aware of his identity on the autism spectrum, as well as his residence in a low socioeconomic area, which deeply contrasted with my own community. By asking for advice from a senior counselor, actively listening, and utilizing therapeutic communication, I helped this camper discover his interest in law studies; at the end of the week, he had become one of the most involved and respected members of my group. This encounter illustrated how all humans hold potential and value, reinforcing my desire for making meaningful connections with people. I saw the importance of embracing differing ideologies, characteristics, or personalities as stimulants of societal growth. As a result, I am eager to field concerns from a diverse patient base and effectively work alongside unique colleagues as a physician. ","I feel a unique sense of fulfillment that only results from selfless acts, which has motivated me to serve my community in various ways throughout college. One of my favorite projects came from my involvement on the Greek Week Steering Committee during my senior year, which coordinates the service aspects of every Greek organization on campus for a week. While on this committee, I positively impacted the community with multiple endeavors. First, I helped organize, promote, and facilitate a weekend blood drive, producing 300 units of blood for local hospitals. Next, I worked on a ‚ÄúPurple Walk‚Äù, which raises community awareness and education about domestic violence and proper sexual conduct. I then collected money for a ‚ÄúPenny War‚Äù which raised significant funds for local non-profit organizations. Lastly, I worked with my fellow committee members to organize a food/clothing drive, then worked to collect, count, and deliver the donated items to those in need. ",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic delayed my initial timeline for attending medical school by halting university research, inhibiting shadowing, and restricting my ability to participate in service projects. Significantly concerned with gaining meaningful experience before committing to medical education, I ultimately opted for a post-graduation application cycle. During this season of setbacks, though, I realized that I struggled with patience. As days went by and I felt stagnant in my endeavors, I reassessed the situation, honing my critical planning skills to recuperate seemingly lost progress. This involved taking advantage of the few opportunities that arose. Additionally, I provided meaningful patient care in the face of a public health crisis and prioritized my endurance. I am now more prepared to adapt to unexpected situations and appreciate delayed gratification. Further, the pandemic motivated me to foster patient trust in the healthcare system, especially through troubling times.",1,0,2

That night I had aided in the treatment of a postoperative young girl, who I’ll name Talia. Talia was born with a deformation to her face that was limiting her quality of life, and she also has autism. I became accustomed to communicating with Talia, who had screws tightened around her jaw, through body language. I became her voice to the physicians and nurses overnight in order to ensure her comfort and health. At about 5 a.m., the female physician and nurse came into the room to tighten the screws around Talia’s jaw. I expressed my thoughts on how Talia’s stuffed animals and sketch pad would best comfort her during an uncomfortable treatment operation. As a team, I comforted Talia with her toys as both the nurse and physician tightened the screws. The operation went as smoothly as possible, and I had never felt so empowered to be standing by two amazing women and a strong, young girl. It brought me great joy that night to have comforted this young girl enough to sleep for the first time in days, be her voice to the team, and collaborate with two amazing females. I realized the dynamic of that night was something that fed my purpose.
During my undergraduate years as a premed, my position at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) as a patient safety sitter allowed me to best reflect my experience working with patients and staff in a healthcare setting. I was able to work closely on patient cases where the nervous system is altered due to disease, disorders, or trauma like schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, etc. As I completed my studies in related fields of biology, chemistry, and neuroscience, I was actively working with patients who were suffering with deficits in these areas, including Talia. This experience allowed my knowledge and curiosity to prosper as I asked questions like what exact deficits are found within the patient's body and how do the prescribed treatments create a proposed fix for the patient’s case? As a patient safety sitter, I am unable to follow through with each patient’s journey and recovery. I am often asked to leave the room during important consultations. I had no final say in the treatment plan of my patients. These limitations reaffirmed my desire to become a physician because I constantly wished I could do more. I want to be a deciding factor in the patient's treatment, because I have the dedication to interpret the symptoms the patient is facing and find any possible solution for the underlying issue at hand.
My position also exposed me to the role of physician and how this role matches my character. As a physician, I will be able to direct the care around my patient, as I observed the physicians would both inform the nurses on next steps while listening to the nurse's opinion of the case. The initiative physicians take matches my tendency to act as a leader in every formal group situation I have been in, where I both guide my team to stay on track while also respecting their opinions and ideas. Physicians are able to personally watch patients progress and make the final decisions related to their treatments. This direct care fulfills my desire to see each patient to the end of treatment. Also of importance to note, my position as a patient safety sitter has opened my eyes to the impact of every employee within the hospital. Every position has an impact on the patient’s life, no matter how long or short their active care. As a physician, I will never be one to neglect the other caretakers that impacted the patient’s progress.
When COVID-19 hit globally and the world went on lockdown, I did not put a lockdown on my goal of becoming a physician and increasing my knowledge and experience to solidify this commitment. Instead, I took advantage of the extra time at home and reached out on volunteer sites, like Crisis Textline, and hospital jobs, like at CHOA. I knew that at this time these two organizations needed the most help, and I was brave and healthy enough to lend a hand. Simultaneously, I got the chance to experience and reflect on a potential lifestyle of hospital shifts, science courses, research, volunteering, and studying all at once. This would be very similar to the dynamic of a medical school student. I know that my life in medical school would fulfill my passion of learning and practicing medicine, being a helping hand, and collaborating with extraordinary peers and physicians. This particular experience with patients and coworkers at CHOA during a pandemic was challenging, but it solidified my interest in becoming a physician. 
As I continued gaining experiences in the healthcare field through shadowing, volunteering, and my clinical job, I not only learned why I want to be a physician but what kind of physician I am committed to becoming. I intend to become a physician that creates meaningful connections with my patients, dedicates extra time to find an explanation for each patient’s case, encourages patients’ to have a healthier lifestyle, fosters healthy relationships between my staff and team, and exacerbates all options for the health and benefit of my patient and/or team.","I grew up spending school breaks in Damascus, Syria, until I was no longer able to visit due to the war. The different customs and beliefs created a divide in connection between myself and my family. One of the beliefs I distinguished in Syria was the fear and distrust of healthcare. I observed my grandmother trembling as she entered a clinic to receive a check up. I witnessed family members put off health check ups until their sickness progressed to an unbearable level. Though I questioned this behavior, I learned to respect their feelings and do my best to comfort them. I learned to communicate and connect with my family through conversations about society, healthcare, customs, etc. and form respect and understanding for opinions differing from mine. _x000D_
As a practicing physician, I intend to practice with caution and understanding and further educate others of the significance of background. I aim to represent doctors that can connect and form trust with patients like my grandmother.","As a camp counselor at Lifetime Athletic gym, I observed the unequal treatment towards female camp counselors. A female counselor would make the same exact mistake as a male counselor; however, the female would receive a strict warning and the male would not. After witnessing a situation like this, the female counselor would often not feel comfortable or safe enough to confront the supervisor about the differential treatment, so I took leadership in doing so. I questioned the supervisor whether equity was a value in this organization and that this scenario, along with a few others I had witnessed, does not make female employees feel safe. I further educated my supervisor on the importance of equity within the workplace. After my conversation with the supervisor, he expressed understanding and apologies. For my remaining time on the job, I did not witness further unequal treatment, so I believe I impacted at least my supervisor, if not the camp work environment as well.",,,1,"I was a freshman undergraduate when the pandemic caused a global quarantine. My planned opportunities for the summer, like research, shadowing, and volunteering, were put on standby. I saw my dad, a pulmonologist, go to work for countless hours and return home afraid to make contact with my family. I reflected on the cost of being a physician in times like these and how I could help._x000D_
I trained to become a crisis text line counselor, which was in high need due to the plummeting mental health of the American people. I began to shadow on virtual platforms. I began my research project under Dr. Perdue virtually. Finally, I applied for a healthcare job at a local hospital. In doing so, I experienced working through challenging times and aiding overwhelmed nurses with behavioral patients. _x000D_
Although the pandemic caused challenging circumstances for my path to medical school, it exposed me to another side of healthcare. I then learned to help others in ways I had not thought of before.",1,0,1

Frozen in disbelief, I felt my heart sink to my stomach. ""It's cancer."" My mother’s words echoed into my ear. After two excruciating weeks, we finally received my mom's breast biopsy results confirming our worst fears. I stood quietly, remembering how just a year prior, my father had survived the complete blockage of an artery morbidly known as the “Widow-maker.” That day, nurses and hospital staff scrambled over my father while the physician directed the entire room. The doctor's swiftness, composure, and certainty in saving my father's life is the type of confidence my mother needed from those around her. Just as I had seen the doctors confront the beast in my father's artery, I found the strength to help my mother take on her own. She faced her illness with grace and courage and now lives cancer-free. My family’s relationship with several doctors over the years inspired my commitment to becoming a physician and treating patients’ illnesses, building connections, and aiding in confronting their beast. 

My love for medicine was cultivated from seeing my parents cured of their suffering, but my interest in healthcare began long before. Goosebumps covered my arms as I walked down the chilly street. Every home seemed indistinguishable from one another. We seldom traveled to my father’s childhood town in the outskirts of Bogota, Colombia, but the times we did struck me deeply. Tall brick buildings were now shuttered homes, and wide paved roads transformed into single dirt pathways. These changes arose a compelling curiosity in me about the inequalities of society.  I was ten years old when my father educated me that access to quality health care was scarce in his town and worsened the deeper you drove into the countryside. I recall children playing soccer on these dirt roads, and it stood out to me that most weren’t wearing shoes.  I struggled to fathom this notion as a child and was left with a feeling of utter helplessness. Growing up, I gathered that these disadvantages are common in Colombia and within my community back home. The trips to my father’s hometown catalyzed my yearning to relieve healthcare disparities in marginalized populations around the world.

Colombia continued to impact me years later. The lively streets full of food and vendors were just as I remembered. Marching towards our makeshift clinic, we digested our surroundings, and the reality of the slums had set in. At the clinic, dozens of families were shuffled into a small daycare room, waiting to be seen. That sobering moment quickly reminded us why we were on this mission. For the first time, my feelings of helplessness dissipated as patients began filtering in. A woman named “Ana” sat in front of me with her arms tightly wrapped around her chest. She gave me a worried stare. “What’s wrong?” I asked her in Spanish. She voiced her concerns about a small lump near her breast. Between tears, she explained her fears of breast cancer. My chest tightened as my mother flashed through my eyes. In hopes of easing her nerves, I told her about my mother’s fight and how strong she remained through it all. A look of hope swept Ana’s face. As our relationship grew, I was relieved she had received the medical care she deserved yet rarely encountered. Ana taught me the importance of human connection. I was eager to return home and eventually make the same connections within my community as a physician.

I opened a window to let the strong Florida rays shine in and uplift the atmosphere. Slurred and emotional words filled the room. Not wanting him to relive his traumatic experience, I listened to ""Jon"" intently. He was reserved and only told bits of his story. “It’s okay,” I said, reaching for his hand. I shared how crucial it was for the doctor to receive a detailed medical history. He finally revealed that a past stroke and subsequent depression had disabled him from working and now seeks a doctor's evaluation. I came across patients displaced from jobs due to limited resources, and I discovered that most didn’t have health insurance. I felt their lack of healthcare literacy did them a disservice. Like Jon, most struggled to deliver their history, and the best approach was to help them feel comfortable and confide in me. Working closely with patients deepened my desire to become a physician and a pillar of support whenever needed. 

I often think back to my time as a little girl standing in a small Colombian town, disillusioned by the inequalities of the health care system. I would reassure her that there was a way to defy the odds that stood before her innocent eyes. From helping Ana in Colombia to consoling Jon in his difficult times, I found the confidence to continue walking the path of medicine. I hope to be granted the opportunity to practice as a physician in local communities and provide healthcare to those in need. There is courage to be gained when becoming the shoulder to lean on for a loved one suffering an illness and compassion to give when standing by a frightened patient. I seek to take the courage and compassion that have developed over my life’s experiences and become a physician who is a beacon of light for patients during their darkest hours.","A blank stare peered back at me after introducing myself. ‚ÄúEspa√±ol?‚Äù I asked when it dawned on me that Lia spoke no English. She nodded with relief. Thankful that my parents pushed me to speak our native language growing up, I wrote down her medical history. I was happy to communicate with Lia and contribute to her feeling welcomed at the office. Working as a medical assistant in Miami, I came across patients from all walks of life. Over time, I found myself illuminating friends and family about the towns in Brazil Gigi urged me to visit, or the infamous ‚Äúhead wobble‚Äù Devon mentioned his Indian culture uses to communicate. Communication was just the beginning in gaining respect and trust from the patient. As they found comfort in talking with me, I grasped their concerns better to relay to the physician. Being exposed to the vast array of cultures in Miami not only enriched my mind but granted me insight into patients and their needs by understanding their individual journeys.","As I listened to patients who sought care from our make-shift clinic in rural Colombia, I quickly realized a commonality amongst the population; many were aware of their high blood pressure or glucose levels but lacked the resources to address these concerns. I observed the positive effect a physician can make by providing quality medical care and the necessary resources, like vitamins and medication, to address the community‚Äôs needs. What truly stuck with me was the valiant stories of the families at the clinic. Even in the face of hardship, the community seemed to find happiness and celebrate each moment. I am humbled to have helped bring attention to these areas and hope they felt supported the way I felt inspired by their stories. This mission trip deepened my aspirations to become a physician and provide equal care to communities back home. If accepted to Rush Medical College, I hope to participate in the mission to elevate neighborhoods on the west side of Chicago.",,,1,"A few weeks prior to the pandemic, I was planning a mission trip, studying for midterms, and excited to begin research. All these endeavors were quickly put aside when my focus shifted to protecting those around me. I was overwhelmed with constant fear for my parents‚Äô safety, and leaving the house for groceries felt like a risk. The pandemic made me realize my decisions can unwillingly affect my loved ones. I watched in awe at the world coming together to help one another. Observing the benevolence and power of community inspired me to turn towards my own for help. I strapped on my mask and knocked on doors where familiar and unfamiliar faces greeted me. It was a pleasant surprise to encounter people willing to gather supplies for at-risk families. Although my goals for the year were postponed, I‚Äôm grateful for the time spent around my family and community. There is value in the unity I created with my community, and hope to do the same with my fellow medical students.",1,0,2

Dozens of eyes and several cameras were turned on me. Just a week before, I had received news that half of my immediate family had been shot and killed. It was my turn to speak now at the rally I had organized and call for action. From my years of research and service, I knew how a single narrative could embolden others to ask for help and illuminate gaps in equity. Yet, I never imagined that my own narrative could be used to fight the public health issue of gun violence. 
My first realization of the power of narrative occurred during my college pre-orientation program, Chicago Bound. We completed meaningful service projects at churches and community gardens, yet the experience I remember the most vividly is our trip to a community center. As my cohort and I sat hip-to-hip on the floor, an ex-gang member confided his personal story about becoming entangled in a gang. He was now a mentor, who helped dozens of young men navigate the dangerous process of leaving gangs. Hearing him speak, I was inspired to also one day use my narrative to impact my community, but I did not yet have my platform or my voice.
During my freshman year, I began to fall behind academically. I was struggling with the adjustment to college, and my pre-health advisor suggested that my grades would preclude me from medicine. However, I regained confidence in myself when I began to study psychology. My college was surrounded by neighborhoods with high community violence, and I became curious about how it impacted child development. While completing my honors thesis on the cognitive effects of community violence, I spent hours interviewing adolescents about their harrowing experiences. Many of those with high violence exposure were children of color. Some of them had experienced violent robberies and heard gunshots before they went to bed each night. Due to our shared racial background, they felt they could open up to me without stigma. Without someone involved in the research process that looked like them, they may have never felt comfortable enough to open up. This was my first experience with the importance of representation in a research setting. 
Yet, my passion for medicine was not solidified until I was a research assistant at the Nutrition and Pregnancy Study, a study that explored disparities in birthing outcomes. My participants were pregnant Black women who came into our study weary of the research process. As a Black woman, I understood personally the harsh history of discrimination in research. Participants felt comfortable enough with me to have an open dialogue that strengthened their trust in research, and the medical process and created an extra layer of support during their pregnancy. One participant, Sarah, saw me as an ally and requested that I attend her ob-gyn visits with her. During her visits, I noticed that Sarah became uneasy. Despite their ability to work together and communicate, there was still an element of distance between Sarah and her physician. It was then I realized the parallel between my participants in the community violence study and Sarah. I wanted to be the type of physician they needed- one with strong clinical skills who was also able to serve those that feel disconnected from the healthcare system due to their racial and cultural background.
Yet, my story was still unfolding. Two months before the end of my post-bacc program, I received news that my sister, niece, and nephew were taken away by her husband in a triple murder-suicide. Heartbroken and emboldened, my mother and I organized “Rally 4 Rosey,” a rally that brought together activists, survivors, and loved ones to discuss domestic violence. My relatives asked me to speak as a representative for our family. Although I was frightened, I called for action, using my personal story to address the need for policy and social change. Tied with my passion for medicine, I now knew how to use my story and had a platform to affect change.
I decided to take an extra year before applying to medical school to heal. I chose to spend my extra year working for the American Medical Women’s Association. During my time at AMWA, I joined Gun Violence Solutions. We provided educational programming to trainees and physicians on how to address gun safety with patients and assess firearm risk. It was fascinating to hear the concerns of practicing physicians and to participate in the open dialogue about how medicine can improve to address the needs of patients with high exposure to violence. 
My experiences have taught me the importance of my narrative. Using my voice, I will work to improve educational training in medical settings surrounding counseling patients for firearm risk, as well as advocate for policies that reduce the amount of firearm-related injuries and deaths. Further, I will use my own narrative to connect with future patients who have had exposure to violence and suffer from the health consequences of exposure. Representation in medicine is important, not just cultural and racial representation, but also representation of life experiences. Although my path has been difficult, it has imbued me with my voice and emboldened my passion for medicine.","During my time on the GlobeMed E-Board, I served with a group of students who were diverse in cultural background and in experiences. Our mission was to form long-term partnerships with grassroots organizations outside of the US, and our partner organization was in Malawi. This required cultural sensitivity and respect for the values and priorities of the Chikwawan community. When strategizing on program implementation, such as the HIV-Awareness program, our chapter had to learn how to advocate awareness for a stigmatized topic in another community._x000D_
Our diverse E-Board included first-generation Chinese immigrants, a native Chicagoan from an under-resourced Latin community, and a child raised in a military family. Due to our different cultural backgrounds, we had conflicting ideas about how to approach forming a relationship with a new community. By first bridging our own cultural barriers, we were better able to collaborate with our partner In Malawi._x000D_
","During the Nutrition and Pregnancy Study, my team and I supported low-income women in Chicago over the course of their pregnancies. _x000D_
 At the beginning of the study, my participants confided in me about their distrust of the research process due to historical incidents of medical racism. As a black woman, I understood their perspective. I validated their unease but also stressed the importance of research that reduced health disparities in the black community. Through open dialogue, I was able to improve their comfort with the research process. _x000D_
During the study, we also connected those with severe depression to community mental health services and those who experienced food insecurity to social workers. _x000D_
Although a good number of our participants experienced pregnancy complications, their rate of pregnancy complications was lower than the general rate for Black women. We hypothesized that this was due to the consistent support that we gave our participants during their pregnancies. _x000D_

After immigrating to America in 2019, I was further tasked with the role of a translator while having to adjust and learn English.

That night, my dad impaled himself in the stomach as a desperate call for help after struggling with depression in silence for years. In a panic, my uncle attempted to treat his wound, while my grandmother, traumatized by her past experience witnessing suicide, delayed calling the paramedics. By the time we reached the ER, my dad was pronounced dead. I was devastated and bewildered. In a rushed tone, the physician explained my dad’s cause of death with words littered with medical jargon I could not understand. When he hastily left to attend to other patients, I remained feeling alone, utterly helpless, and unable to find my voice. That night I witnessed firsthand the cultural and linguistic barriers that prevented inclusive care for my family. Since then, I have deeply contemplated the role of a physician in advocacy for patients’ health and pondered the idea of culturally appropriate care. In my last moments with my dad, I promised him that I would strive to uplift the voices of those who are overlooked so that they would not be left in the dark like our family was.

To fulfill my promise, I devoted my undergraduate career to community advocacy. I discovered my passion for community outreach when I joined bridges Multicultural Resource Center at UC Berkeley, where I helped to mobilize resources for organizations serving students from historically disenfranchised backgrounds. By creating inclusive space for cultural engagement and professional support, I facilitated effective cross-cultural discourses and elevated the voices of underrepresented students on campus. During this time, the micro-aggressions reported by students of color accumulated. Their frustration reminded me of the helplessness I experienced being left behind at the ER. It was then that I began to wonder about advocacy in medicine, and this curiosity ignited a spark in me to utilize my experience as a community organizer to tackle inequities in healthcare.
 
My curiosity for advocacy in healthcare led me to pursue the REACH Internship at Asian Health Services (AHS), where I gradually recognized the correlation of patients missing appointments and the declining state of their health. Determined to tackle this issue, I advocated for the implementation of the Companion Care Program (CCP) and consequently served as the Program Coordinator to provide assistance and connect patients for long-term companionship. One of my patients was Mrs. Y., a refugee who confided in me her experience of discrimination that prevented her from seeking diabetes treatment. Her story reminded me of my grandmother, whose fears of the stigma around suicide prevented her from seeking immediate treatment for my dad. As I spent the rest of the year supporting Mrs. Y., I was able to leverage my community advocacy experiences to assist her in navigating the healthcare system. Seeing Mrs. Y.’s health improve as a result of support from CCP affirmed that my passion lies in providing direct care for vulnerable populations. Moving forward, my aim is to be a physician that instills cultural humility and compassion in my practice to make tangible impacts on patients’ wellbeing.
 
I realized that health encompasses more than medical support after my time working at AHS and it brought me back to my outreach trip to Compton High School in second year of college. During this trip, I met J., a student who suffered from multiple physical and mental disorders. He left me a crumbled paper at the end of a school-to-prison pipeline self-reflection exercise that crushed my soul: “All dead. Where to go from here?” I later learned that no one extended their hands to him. Everyone assumed that J.’s situation was ordinary amongst children growing up in Compton, reducing his experience to a statistic and stereotype. Desperate to support him, I worked with J. to undertake medical treatment. Though J. noticed improvement after meeting with the primary care physician, I know that his best health outcomes will only be achieved once the systematic issues that prevented him from seeking treatments are addressed. Looking back, I learned that effective patient-care needs to go beyond providing bandage solutions. I became determined to not just be a physician, but to be one who is aware of the unique needs of my patients inside and outside of clinical settings to promote wellness through preventative care, education, and advocacy.
 
As a clinician, I will strive to cultivate meaningful relationships with my patients to empower them to recognize their own voice, and to break down societal barriers so future generations can dare to dream. Above all, I hope to integrate my passion for community activism with the medical degree to be a primary care physician that serves the most vulnerable populations: the overlooked, resource-denied, and marginalized. The journey that started from a promise to my dad has given me the conviction to engage in the life-long learning process with patient advocacy at the forefront of my efforts. No matter how rigorous the pursuit of these goals may be, I am deeply encouraged by the path that lies ahead and am sincerely devoted to the practice of culturally affirming medicine.","Healthcare disparity stemming from systemic barriers is a devastating issue for Native American communities. I learned of this injustice after meeting Mr. B, a Navajo Nation resident who lost his wife due to the lack of medical support during the pandemic. He believes that the healthcare system does not stand with marginalized populations. His words prompted me to reflect on my privilege. Moreover, I became determined to value the unique needs of marginalized populations and to make an upstream impact to eliminate provider shortage in tribal areas. I am currently working toward this goal as HEAL Initiative Policy Research Specialist. In this role, I draft legislative proposals, organize meetings with congressmen, and build a coalition of academic centers advocating for Indigenous rights. As a physician, I will continue to mobilize for the advancement of the rural/ tribal healthcare workforce, build public health power and advance the right to health through political activism","Throughout my undergraduate career, I worked as a BUILD Mentor, where I tutored K-12 students of color in Oakland, CA. A student who I mentored was E, who was living in chronic poverty and violence. This is an experience that I am all too familiar with.

We would discuss school, his dream, and how to get to where he wanted to go in life. Now, E. is looking forward to becoming a first-generation college student. By going the extra mile to support E., I broke down the educational barrier and provided him with the foundation to pursue this dream.

How could something as simple as an additional chromosome create the condition that perplexed my family so much? Curious to learn more, I started conversations with my mother about what it was like to have a baby with Down Syndrome. She often reacted with silence, and I had to wait patiently for her to be ready to speak. Her demeanor would change as she described her initial denial and feeling of hopelessness. As disabilities were not openly discussed within our Asian culture, the diagnosis was completely foreign to her. Due to my parents’ upbringing, they feared how their families would react. I knew she felt discouraged to have these discussions, but I wished someone told her it was okay to do so earlier. My conversations with my mother about this difficult topic helped break her stigma around disabilities and strengthened the relationship within our household. In many cultures, family bonds are strong, but communicating about stigmatized health topics keeps families from growing and healing.  I want to be a bridge between people and their well-being by addressing stigmatized issues and social determinants of health through compassionate, culturally appropriate medical care.
In order to be a successful facilitator towards patients, I realized that one needs to communicate the science of medicine in a way that is accessible to the public. While scribing at California Eye Surgeons, I met a patient who was inconsistently taking his drops for glaucoma. As Dr. Kaur spoke to him, I realized he had not fully grasped the severity of his condition. She explained how the disease causes irreversible blindness and how early signs are often undetectable to the patient. Most of all, she emphasized how the eyes help us navigate the world, and without his medication, he will eventually lose the ability to drive, read his newspapers, and do the things he loves to do. After Dr. Kaur left the room, I stayed with the patient to ensure he fully understood the treatment plan. I explained how glaucoma was caused by elevated eye pressure and how the medications the physician prescribed for him would help extend his quality of life. He reacted with furrowed eyebrows, finally understanding the reality of his condition. Spending time with Dr. Kaur showed me that the physician must balance treating the pathophysiology of disease with interacting and caring for people. Seeing how many patients have different social and educational backgrounds, I aspire to become the physician that provides relevant patient education and encourages important lifestyle changes while being the facilitator between the science and humanity of medicine.
While my goal in becoming a physician is to serve as a bridge between patients and healthcare, I learned that different language barriers can create hurdles while trying to provide care. When I was volunteering at a COVID-19 vaccination site, I noticed an anxious woman standing at the check-in table with her ID shaking in her hands and her eyes darting around as if looking for someone. When I heard her speak Mandarin, I rushed over to help interpret. Her stress and fear markedly diminished; as she heard me speak her native language, her expression softened, and she let out a sigh of relief. After checking in, I shared her worries about the vaccine with the on-site physician, and I interpreted to the patient that given her medical history, the chance of an adverse reaction was low. I made sure to stay with her throughout her entire process, and she expressed how lost she would have been without anyone being able to help her communicate.  The encounter reminded me of language’s power to build a sense of trust and relief, especially when approaching sensitive topics that patients may be hesitant to discuss. Being able to speak Mandarin fluently and continuing to build upon my Spanish, I hope to reduce some of the barriers that my future patients will face when accessing healthcare with me. 
While I initially became a software engineer due to the lure of job security, I quickly felt unfulfilled from the lack of contact with those who would be affected by my work.  My medical experiences filled what I felt was missing and gave me a newfound passion to address social challenges in healthcare. Becoming a physician allows me to utilize logical thinking and problem solving, aspects of computer science that I enjoyed, to apply the science of medicine to diagnoses and treatments. Along with scientific reasoning, I want to provide culturally appropriate care for various marginalized groups and volunteer for those who may not have the resources. I look forward to becoming a physician who can combine both compassion and logical thinking in assessing cultural discrepancies in healthcare, providing more ease to families like my own.","During the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020, people brought up issues surrounding the dance scene. While the dance I was involved in was called ‚ÄúUrban Dance‚Äù, it was brought up that ‚ÄúUrban‚Äù was a derogatory term used against Black and Brown communities. As the style stems from street styles originating from Black cultural forms, I felt that I failed as a director of my team for not teaching its rooted origins. I attended speaker events, learning how Black dance forms gave a space of expression for marginalized voices. Through these resources, I helped create policies requiring leaders to teach the importance of its cultural context. _x000D_
_x000D_
I learned how it is important to not only understand, but also to be proactive in learning from different backgrounds. I observed how words carry a lot of weight, and I have become aware of my word choice when speaking to patients. With culturally competent care, I will continue to take actionable steps to provide the best care as a future physician.","During November 2020, I arrived for my shift at my local food pantry and was shocked at the number of clients lined up. I rushed to load grocery carts, found use of my Mandarin skills to assist clients who could not speak English well, and handed bags of prepared meals for homeless clients. At the end of my shift, I realized I had helped about 50 clients during a pandemic. The impact I felt in what I was doing gave me a vigor and passion to continue helping the underserved._x000D_

Some clients I see currently are the same ones I saw from my first shift, and we have established a relationship that continues on conversations from previous weeks. I save specific foods for clients I remember with food allergies, providing what they need with their food limitations. Volunteering in my community has not only provided healthy food options and hygiene kits to lower income and homeless clients; I also helped provide a mental break from stressors in their lives through having cheerful conversations.",,,1,"I was laid off from my full-time software job a month before the pandemic started. The lack of job opportunities put a pause on my job search, and I spent the break thinking about my future career path. I recalled how I struggled to picture myself continuing as an engineer and decided to pursue a career that gave me a stronger purpose. _x000D_

I moved back home to save money and made a part-time income by taking care of my brother with disabilities. It was difficult to find medical opportunities, so I volunteered at a food pantry and a vaccine site. After applying to many job positions, I was hired as a medical assistant and scribe, and because I was turned down by most physicians due to COVID-19 concerns, I utilized online resources to shadow. _x000D_

In my opinion, man’s worst enemy is disease. We’ve seen it all around us these past couple of years, and man had to make a choice: sit on the sidelines or combat its worst enemy. Over the past couple of years, I was able to combat disease, or at least contribute to the effort. From these experiences, I gained a greater passion for science and healing, both of which I plan to utilize for the rest of my career. 
I have always known I wanted to work in the healthcare field, but it wasn't until the COVID-19 pandemic that I knew why. I spent the first few months of the pandemic doing the same as many others: waiting for something to happen. But as someone who always needs to find the solution to a problem, I was itching to help. That opportunity came in the fall of 2020 when my supervisor asked me to run COVID-19 tests. She cautioned me against the opportunity and emphasized my risk of being exposed if I decided to help. However, for months I had been sitting on the sidelines watching others sacrifice their health for others, and I was ready to do the same. 
Weeks into testing, my heart still skipped a beat every time the machine read back positive. For a split second, it seemed like the world stopped, and for someone, it would stop, for the next 14 days at least. I would quietly and calmly walk over to Kristie, our nurse, who delivered the bad news. Then, I would sit back down and keep running the machines, because the pandemic wasn't going anywhere, and hundreds of people were lined up to be tested. There was a disease, and as far as I knew, I was part of the remedy. To me, this was a glimpse of what my future could be like. 
The sense of purpose I gained from running COVID-19 tests quickly plummeted when I was sent home for winter break and could no longer help at school. However, I sought out another opportunity when I applied to volunteer at a local hospital. On the first day of orientation, I was handed a purple lab coat that distinguished volunteers from employees, and whenever I walked to the GI lab for my shift, at least one person told me they were ecstatic to see a purple coat again. That day, I was introduced to a physician who warned me to go home because ""1 in 12 people here is carrying the disease."" Still, this wasn't enough to turn me away from the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work in a hospital during a pandemic. Sitting with patients so they could see a friendly face in recovery, then wheeling them out to their loved ones were moments that I felt certain of my purpose. This was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life: see a disease, find its remedy, and watch healthy patients go back to their families and live their lives. 
As positive as my experience in the hospital was during the winter of 2020, I know that the reality of being in the healthcare field isn't always so: there is not always a cure for every disease. In just one year, the entire world experienced the grief of millions of lives lost to an incurable virus, yet hundreds of other diseases torment our population every day, such as cancer. While I could not specifically cure cancer, during the summer of 2021, I was given the opportunity to conduct research for multi-cancer screening products. This opportunity gave me a new insight into the concept of disease, that there is more than one remedy: treatment and prevention. Ironically enough, not long after my time spent researching and developing cancer screening products, my uncle passed away from colon cancer that could have been prevented if he had just gotten screened. This happened just a few months after I spent my entire summer working to develop a screening product to save lives. However, I plan to use my uncle’s memory as well as my time in research to emphasize the importance of prevention and screening when working in the future to combat disease. 
One of the primary goals of any good physician is to see disease and find its remedy, and if not possible, do everything in their power to try. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I saw the disease and though I did not literally find its remedy, I tried to help in any way possible. I had experiences on both ends of combating disease: prevention and treatment. Just as I did in those situations, I want to dedicate the rest of my life to seeing disease and finding its remedy. Following the theme of prevention versus treatment, I will be spending my gap year earning my Master’s degree in Population Health Sciences, which will allow me to combine preventative measures of community health, as well as treatment in the clinical setting. This experience as well as all the other opportunities I have been given during my college career will allow me to become a well-rounded physician who combines prevention and treatment in the field of medicine. The empathy, selflessness, and dedication to health and medicine I saw from the doctors, nurses, researchers, and epidemiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic are all qualities I strive to possess. With these qualities, I hope to spend my career combating “man’s worst enemy,” and I would love to start that journey by being admitted to your program.","During my undergraduate years, I minored in Spanish, which gave me many opportunities and insights into different cultures within the United States, specifically in the state of Alabama. One experience that contributed to my readiness for practicing medicine in a multicultural society was when I volunteered as an interpreter for Hispanic patients at a clinic. I interacted with Spanish-speaking patients who utilized the free clinic or the Medicaid office, a demographic that was new to me. I worked under an OBGYN and communicated to patients many milestones: confirmed pregnancy, due date, and sex of the baby. I saw some of the most vulnerable people in healthcare and gained insight into the needs of patients in the US while appreciating relationships with people from different backgrounds than my own. Working with a different demographic helped me see how race and socioeconomic factors affect health, and what work needs to be done to close the healthcare gap.","_x000D_
Beginning the fall of 2020 when normal operations were suspended, I was asked to help administer COVID-19 tests to students, faculty, and staff. I worked up to twenty hours a week, sometimes 9 hours a day, running SOFIA rapid test machines and helping test hundreds of people. This role was very important in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 on campus. The most important skill I gained from this experience was adaptability because I had to work around my class schedule in order to be an extra set of hands to make sure the Tuscaloosa community stayed healthy. By the time I finished testing community members in the spring of 2021, I helped administer over 1000 tests, and I felt that there had to be at least one person in the community who was a little healthier because of me. Something I learned about myself from this is that I can't sit on the sidelines during times of crisis; I want to be involved in the healing process. I plan to transfer that mindset to becoming a physician._x000D_
",,,1,"When COVID-19 hit, I was taking my hardest undergraduate class online, at home, and alone, and I was not handling it well. I sought professional help to cope with my anxiety, which had been growing my whole life, but was magnified during the pandemic. I began going to therapy and starting medication to help with my anxiety, which allowed me to focus better when studying and succeed academically. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I started to see an upward trend in my academic performance as well as professional growth opportunities. Because of the opportunities, I was given to help the community during the pandemic, I became much more passionate about the field of medicine. I spent much of the pandemic contributing to the medical community by working as a COVID-19 test technician and volunteering in various clinical settings, including a hospital GI lab and a free clinic. During the pandemic, I acknowledged my mental health and improved it to allow for more opportunities.",1,0,1
2023,15430288,2022,26,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"Being a first-generation college student of color at a predominantly white institution sparks plenty of confusion, culture shock, and emotion. I felt as though I had entered college lacking the academic and practical knowledge necessary in order to be successful in higher education. Having been unfamiliar with the rigor and expectations of the college curriculum and having less exposure to the college-going culture resulted in this difficulty in assimilating into the college setting academically and socially. 

Alongside being a first-generation college student, due to my single mother’s limited income, I had to take on three jobs my freshman year.  Initially, I struggled with maintaining my hectic work schedule, classes, and extracurriculars. However, this work helped me pay for living and college expenses i.e., books, tuition, and a meal plan. My course grades were not as high as I wanted them to be and I struggled significantly during my freshman/sophomore year.

Empty oxygen tanks, expired prescription bottles, and soiled furniture packed the space intended for social activities. At the end of a long hallway, a grieving woman enveloped a motionless man. After delivering several rounds of chest compressions to the man, I checked his pulse. The paramedic called the time of death. While I comforted the woman, I thought about all the possible scenarios that could have led to this moment. I thought about whether there was anything more my partner and I could have done to save my patient’s life. Though being an EMT in Holyoke, MA is challenging and demanding, I am committed to saving people’s lives and serving my community. 

Emotionally and physically drained, my partner and I returned to base to perpetuate the cycle. I brushed my teeth, made my cot, and rested my head on my pillow. Then, I reflected on my first bad day as an EMT: four patients died, an eighteen-month-old was transported to the ER, a twenty-two-year-old attempted suicide. Flowing down my face were tears that had welled up from deep within. The radio sounded, “medic 1, medic 1, please respond to. . . .” Blinded by my tears, I struggled to slide my feet into my heavy boots as I headed to the truck. The truck—a twenty-by-eight-foot box—was a sanctuary that induced me to take care of my own needs. The truck shielded my humanity from the gravity of the world around me and helped me unpack the emotional and physical trauma I witnessed each time I entered that world. The truck is where my partner and I confided in and comforted each other; where we debriefed about our patient interactions and where we prepped for incoming calls. In essence, the twenty-by-eight-foot box healed me like it was aware that my energy was consumed by those I cared for inside of itself and in the field. My days were long and exhausting, yet I persisted through difficult situations, so I could treat my patients. These difficult situations are what have contributed to my growth as a human being, an EMT, and a future physician.

One difficult situation I experienced in Holyoke was a language barrier in a primarily Spanish-speaking community. This language barrier hindered my ability to provide quality patient care in the field. After coming to this realization, I taught myself basic Spanish words and phrases. To deepen my knowledge of Spanish, I downloaded an easily accessible translation application, Speak and Translate, on my iPhone. Visual communication methods such as hand gestures and facial expressions also helped me bridge this substantial language barrier. I am by no means fluent in Spanish, but it was fulfilling to see the relief on my patient's faces when I ask: “¿Dónde está tu dolor?” I found that adapting to my environment was both advantageous for my patients and myself. Linguistically immersing myself in a community I frequently entered empowered me to better localize the source of my patient's problems and to build rapport with community members. My commitment to serving those in my community became more than just a passion; it became a responsibility. 

To provide compassionate and quality care, I had to recognize what it means to be human. To be human is to be whole. I had to ensure myself that I was someone who possessed feelings, emotions, and a sense of logic and someone who could both connect with and disconnect from patients. Recognizing my own humanity created a space for me to treat patients for who they were and not merely for what they had, thus treating not just their ailing bodies but also their ailing spirits. As time went on, I learned to become comfortable with the unfamiliar and to accept adversity. Every call, every story, and every problem was different. However, the manner in which I relieved their pain, stopped their bleeding, and helped them grieve was similar. Additionally, I learned to appreciate the importance of empathy. Empathy is the characteristic of humanity that resists the entropy and disorder of the world around it. Mediating the bad and fostering the good, empathy strives to deliver compassion all while accepting that the world will need help – I being the one who can help it. Making patients and their loved ones feel cared for, developing strong relationships with community members, and treating them like my own family are how I have and hope to continue to humanize medicine.

The study of medicine is a life-long commitment and one that I am eager to make. To gain the autonomy to diagnose, treat, and heal those who have not been able to heal themselves all while working in a career that is continually evolving and intellectually stimulating. Having said this, my experiences thus far have not deterred me away from pursuing medicine, but they have instilled in me a sense of enthusiasm for what is to come. This past year only confirms this – my passion for medicine regardless of the roadblocks I’ve faced in the process. To help and to heal, but most importantly, to recognize that studying medicine is a privilege and I promise to devote my time to both the study of science and caring for my patients.","Having served as an EMT in Holyoke, with a largely Hispanic population, it was a wake-up call to interact with a community whose first or native language was not English‚Äîa constant I have had in my education and upbringing. Aside from uncovering my own unconscious biases related to equitable care, working with this population enabled me to take tangible steps towards breaking down these barriers through learning universal hand gestures, simple medical phrases in Spanish, and the cultural relevancy and importance of the family unit. These steps provided me with positive experiences and yielded compassion and inclusivity from myself and my peers allowing us to better serve our community. Serving communities during their most vulnerable moments not only sheds light on the value of effective communication, but the value of cultural competence. Holyoke provided insight into different cultures, the adversities these populations may face, and how I, as a provider can be socially accountable.","As someone who grew up in an economically disadvantaged and medically underserved community, I‚Äôve had a passion for addressing the social determinants of health as an individual and prospective medical student. The last two years alone have revealed the significant disparities associated with health inequity and the urgent need for proactive advocacy to address these issues. From serving meals on the weekends and laundry services during the week to orchestrating vaccination clinics during the pandemic and assisting with staffing shortages at shelters on cold winter nights - I have been at the forefront. I not only serve these communities, but I am also a part of these communities - being their voice and addressing their needs as if they were mine.",,,1,"What I thought would be a temporary fight against a harmful disease, turned out to be a two-year battle leaving the world in a debilitating condition.

At just twenty-two years old, I was a full-time student, working 60+ hours a week as an EMT.

The twinge at the edge of his mouth told me his leg hadn’t healed. I poured him a cup of coffee with a heap of sugar and walked him back to the lab. I sat on the floor staring into what can only be described as a hole in Tom’s leg. It had signs of cellulitis with swelling and redness present. I looked up at Tom and once again found myself saying, “I’m not a doctor Tom, but I think it’s time to go see one.” His face sank. He said that he didn’t want to go in, that the last time emergency department providers had been unkind. He gave a heavy sigh and told me that he wasn’t going in yet, it wasn’t bad enough. At that moment I knew I never wanted to hear those words again. I wanted to be the doctor so that Tom wouldn't have to wait for things to get worse before accessing care.
It took me a long time to reach sitting with Tom on the floor of the lab. I first learned about harm reduction in 2012 at HIPS, a harm reduction organization providing syringe services and outreach to people who use drugs and sex workers, in Washington, DC. The tenants drew me in: centering individuals, honoring autonomy and recognizing intersectionality and its inherent complexities. HIPS was in a dingy strip mall basement and there I learned the importance of challenging my normative views of drug use. One particular moment will always stick with me. In small groups we were exploring our personal biases and values around drugs and people who use them. The scenario was this - you’re on outreach and a pregnant woman comes up to the van asking for needles. What do you do? My initial reaction was outright refusal. But reflecting on what we’d just spent hours learning, I took a step back and acknowledged that I didn’t know anything about this person. I didn’t know whether she was picking up needles for someone else, or if the needles were for illicit drugs or diabetes. But most importantly none of that mattered. What mattered was that she was showing up, in the face of potential judgment and scrutiny to get new needles. Harm reduction humbles us. It reminds us that we lack insight into others' lives. Instead of judging or being directive, we acknowledge people have reasons for their behavior, and we work to understand them. Like in medicine, our goal is to work alongside participants, offering education and resources to minimize harm while respecting boundaries.
While working at various SSPs across Massachusetts I learned all I could. I learned how to share the results of a blood draw I’d taken a few days before, informing someone of their new HIV status. I learned how to pack a crack pipe, the best (and worst) ways to de-escalate people and how to reverse an overdose. I also learned how to handle the death of our participants and hold space for a grieving community. To me, not only was my role about providing resources and education but also to learn from people who are experts: people who use drugs.
It wasn’t until I began working at Massachusetts General Hospital that I gained insight into our participants' experiences while admitted. I work as a Clinical Research Coordinator in the Substance Use Disorders Initiative where my role involves chart review and extracting data for research. I am also able to sit in on the Addiction Consult Team’s (ACT) rounds. I hear about ailments and treatment options, and am learning how providers think, make decisions and work together. As a result, I have come to understand the challenges medical professionals have when working with and advocating for people who use drugs in an inpatient setting. As I sit in rounds and read hundreds of charts, I can’t help thinking about the abscesses, osteomyelitis and viral infection that could have been prevented or treated earlier.
I have had the honor of working with many fine colleagues. One mentor, Dr. Fleming, arrived at the Cambridge SSP to be the first on-sight primary care physician. In the beginning she only had clinic for a half a day, once a week. None of the participants knew or trusted her, so Dr. Fleming spent time in the drop-in building rapport. Folks began to trickle in to see her for their medical needs and within weeks there was a waiting list. I had the privilege of shadowing her and seeing firsthand how she worked with our folks. Understanding and kind, she also knew how to be direct when necessary. Dr. Fleming showed how primary care in non-traditional settings can work incredibly well to help address medical concerns faced by people who use drugs. This is the kind of care that I hope to provide to patients, care that is accessible, in spaces where people already feel safe.
I want to be a doctor so that I can work to provide meaningful, patient centered care to people who use drugs; care that prioritizes individual autonomy and the incremental shifts we are all capable of making. I aim to create spaces where the voices of people who use drugs are embraced as experts in how we can improve. And I hope to follow in the footsteps of those compassionate providers who came before me, continuing to expand our understanding of what quality care for people who use drugs looks like. More than anything, I want to look at Tom one day and say, ‘I can help you with that.’
Thank you for your consideration","Eighteen-year-old me would not have imagined that one day some of the dearest people in my life would be a group of sex workers, people living unhoused and people who use drugs. Today I couldn‚Äôt imagine where I would be without my harm reduction community. Prior to my introduction to harm reduction at HIPS, I led a relatively sheltered life. At HIPS I learned even though I viewed myself as accepting and open minded, I was harboring assumptions and biases. The staff and volunteers helped to unpack those ideas, explore where they came from and question why they persisted. HIPS, and the harm reduction community at large, taught me a new style of self-evaluation and critical thought. I learned that people who use drugs, live unhoused and/or trade sex are the smartest, hardest working and most creative people I have ever met. I also learned the importance of actively listening to understand, of entering a new community with humility and that commonalities can be found between all people.","When I first arrived in Massachusetts, I attended a hack-a-thon for the ‚Äúopioid crisis.‚Äù It was 2016 and opiate related overdose deaths would hit 2,110 that year. At this event I met a group of people who shared my desire to legalize safe consumption sites. We began meeting every Sunday and named our activism/advocacy group SIFMA Now!. Since 2016 we‚Äôve worked with the state legislature introducing bills that would legalize safe consumption sites, held panel discussions and set up mock safe consumption sites for educational purposes. One of my favorite aspects of this advocacy work is talking with people who may be skeptical of safe consumption sites, listening to their concerns and trying to address them while also honoring their perspective. We have yet to successfully pass legislation, but we have educated hundreds of people about safe consumption sites, built partnerships with municipalities and organizations and hope to see the opening of a safe consumption site in Somerville soon.",,,1,"When the pandemic hit I was working at a syringe service program and taking classes at Tufts University.  As the pandemic worsened in early 2020, the community drop-in space at the syringe service program was forced to close. Frontline staff worked together to craft an outreach dominant service delivery model focusing on areas we knew our community members spent time. We pre-made safer injecting kits, Narcan kits and food packs and hit the streets by foot, bike and van. As classes shifted online, I continued attending my organic chemistry lecture, office hours and lab but my focus was divided. Taking an exceptional pass in organic chemistry lecture allowed me time to make safety plans at the syringe service program and advocate for resources like personal protective equipment and access to bathrooms/handwashing stations for community members living outside. It wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, but it allowed me the freedom  to serve my community during a time of great need.",1,0,3

The rusty sheet metal encasement resembled a junkyard more than a home. It was the typical Guatemalan house. They all fit on the same mattress even though it bowed and conformed to the ground below. After meeting this family, we knew that something had to be done. Fortunately, we knew an individual that constructed cement houses. He agreed to help us so long as we provided the manual labor for free. It was hard work, but I will never forget the gratitude radiating from their faces as we put the last cement block in place. It was no mansion, but to them it was everything. I felt a huge sense of accomplishment knowing their quality of life had improved.
When working as a Certified Nursing Assistant, I found at times that attending to an individuals’ every need physically and emotionally difficult. This heightened when Covid breached our building. Panic spread quickly through the facility as nearly everyone’s health worsened. One patient in particular that I was close with tested positive, and despite our best efforts with a ventilator, she eventually passed away. It was difficult for me, but even more difficult for her husband who was unable to say goodbye due to the visitor restrictions in place. As he picked up her belongings, I was at a loss of what to say. I hurt for him and his situation. I told him that I was sorry for his loss and that his wife was a wonderful lady. Tears ran down his face as he thanked me for taking care of her.   
My life-long passion for science and problem solving are what led me to initially pursue the field of medicine. I was looking forward to shadowing an oncologist at IMC Hospital to see how the sciences applied to cancer treatment. My excitement quickly shattered when Dr. Low told Tim that the glioblastoma would take his life. Tim muttered, “Are you saying that I will never get to hear the word remission?” I was crushed as I watched his spouse embrace him, and shocked to hear that he did not want to proceed with any form of palliative treatment. Dr. Low taught me that however rare refusal of treatment might be, a patient’s autonomy is one of the most important things to respect. Within any specialty in medicine, the patient’s decision is always the most important.  
My time volunteering as a Spanish interpreter at the Maliheh Free Clinic has been similar yet different from my other clinical experiences. Patients who qualify to be seen at the clinic are seeking the most basic form of healthcare. My job is to translate as best I can what is said in the exam room. Misunderstandings sometimes can happen due to cultural differences, so it is extremely important to have patience while communicating. One individual came to the clinic wanting to discuss her colonoscopy results. Although she firmly stated she had been tested a couple weeks prior, the documentation thereof was nowhere to be found. After a few minutes of confusion and frustration from both the doctor and the patient, I asked permission to clarify with the patient if she knew what a colonoscopy was. It turned out she did not and was unclear about what test had been administered. Although both people were frustrated, the doctor kept his composure throughout the visit. He taught me that patience is a crucial skill to have in all clinical interactions. 
The people that I have had the opportunity to work with have taught me a lot about what sort of a physician I want to be. Whether it be an opportunity to cure a patient’s cancer or consoling a loved one, I want to respect and care for those I interact with. If I find myself in situations requiring hard work or having to exhibit patience, my goal is to alleviate some of the pain and suffering that others experience. I aspire to become a physician because I want to make a difference in the world, and I feel that through my medical knowledge and resources I can do just that.","Growing up playing soccer, I met and competed alongside individuals from many different cultural backgrounds. This opportunity made it natural for me to accept others from all over the world. Amir was a teammate of mine from Afghanistan. Along with his family, they moved here to avoid the terroristic actions inflicted by different organizations. Amir shared with me how difficult it had been to fit in ever since the 9/11 attacks. One frustration he and his family faced was getting through airport security. Nearly each time, they were taken to a separate room to be ‚Äúrandomly checked‚Äù. Unfortunately, injustice towards Afghans is not the only inequality present today._x000D_
Playing soccer helped me to view others as equals. I find it important to look past the differences that separate us and see people for who they are. I hope my experiences in medical school and beyond can continue to enhance my ability to understand more diverse populations and connect with all individuals.","For a little over a year, I have volunteered as a Spanish Medical Interpreter at the Maliheh Free Clinic in Millcreek, Utah. Most of the patients seen at the clinic are refugees or recent immigrants. Without translators, millions of individuals all over the world would not be able to communicate their healthcare needs. I enjoy translating for patients, and I believe it is just one way that I advocate for the Spanish-speaking population. I minored in Spanish in hopes that it would allow me to be a resource for underserved populations. It may not have changed a community, but I believe I have helped countless people receive the care they need. I am a firm believer that change comes from small changes and influences. I think that my service can help Chicago‚Äôs westside, whether patient‚Äôs speak Spanish or not.",,,1,"My time as a C.N.A. during the pandemic was difficult. I learned quickly that taking care of patients is not always a happy road to recovery, especially when they have COVID. When I think of the pandemic, I think of people like Ross. He had advanced Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and was unable to say goodbye to his family before he passed away. It was very tough to see him go, but it motivated me to continue my pursuit of medicine.

2023,15435487,,23,Woman,USA,1,EO2,0,1,"I have personally experienced and witnessed the effect the lack of healthcare can have on family and community. I left Nagaland when I was only three, but the family we left behind still faces a lack of primary medical care, primary care physicians, and other basic medical resources. The people there have limited health resources and educational opportunities. As a graduate student, my father, the only one who could legally work, had to juggle part-time jobs to support not only my family but also our immediate family back home—monthly subsistence and funds to seek higher quality medical care in larger cities.
The disparity in healthcare access is apparent even in the U.S. as there are still many in underserved communities who lack access to medical care. My family is an example of those who had a hard time affording basic medical care. As the beneficiary of low-income clinics in the community, we understand what it means to live in fear of getting ill or injured. Such experiences motivated me to pursue studies in the medical field which would prepare me to go out and help those who need healthcare the most.

This is something I am proud to say. My mother’s hands have always been a point of pride for her, and for good reason. She has lovely hands with smooth skin and elegant fingers. I remember as a child, I would watch in awe as she delicately painted her nails, smiling at her hands with quiet satisfaction.
It was the night she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis that I saw her look down at them for the first time with betrayal. These were the hands that carried me into and through life. Hands that I looked to for comfort and guidance. Hands that would now one day grow crooked and knobby like branches on a tree.
I recall huddling close to her as she spoke with the doctor, straining to hear the other side of the conversation through the phone. After she hung up, she cried, and so did I, our hands clasped tightly together. 
The diagnosis initially seemed like a life doomed to be full of aching joints and immobilizing inflammation. Already, she would have bad days on which even walking was a great labor. Already, it was tough to watch her endure the pain of daily life. I did not want to imagine how it might worsen with time. 
It was during this time that I was searching for my first Northeastern co-op, my mother at the back of my mind as I went from interview to interview. It wasn’t until I interviewed for the immuno-oncology group at Morphic Therapeutic that I felt a deep spark of interest. As they explained their research, I realized it was yet another instance of the immune system being led astray. In my mother’s case, the immune cells found an enemy in their own host, while in the case of cancer, the immune cells were being misled by the tumor cells. During my time there, I came to learn about the immune system and gain some insight as to why something that is supposed to protect us could turn around and wreak so much havoc. At the end of the six months, I knew I had barely grazed the surface of what there was to learn and be discovered. However, as much as I loved the research and the promise that each new discovery held, it felt so far removed from the people for which it was intended. I wanted some way to contribute to those who needed help now, and I was able to do so through my second co-op working as a Patient Care Associate at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
At Brigham, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with esteemed healthcare professionals of all specializations. I found that I learned just as much from interacting with patients of different backgrounds as I did from the hospital staff. One particular patient sticks with me to this day. She was about my age. I was taking her vitals, just as I had with a hundred others; however this time, there was one problem. She could not stop sobbing, sending her heart rate well into the 100s and her blood pressure even higher. I could sense people growing impatient after the third attempt. I could understand their frustration in wanting to get going with the million standard questions they needed to ask, but I felt for her. She was alone due to COVID-19 restrictions. She was cold in only a hospital gown, scared, and surrounded by strangers. Who wouldn’t want to cry? I remember taking her hand in mine and having her take a few breaths with me while trying to console her as I had seen so many of the nurses had done before and as my mother had done for me when I was younger. 
In a year’s time, after participating in one fateful FMRI research study and the coincidental discovery of a long harbored brain tumor, I found myself in the same position as that patient. Everyone that read my case file gushed about how lucky I was to have accidentally discovered the tumor before it started causing issues. I knew they were right, but it had been one wild ride of a year since the discovery—definitely not the senior year I was hoping for. 
I remember smiling at the irony of the Patient Care Assistant at Dartmouth Hitchcock taking the same vitals and asking the same questions as I had for months. Going into surgery, I should have been nervous, brain surgery is a pretty big deal, but surprisingly I wasn’t. I felt like everything in my life had led to that moment: research in oncology, working in pre-op/PACU, the research study, and getting to know my amazing surgeon over the course of a year. With one final squeeze of my mother’s hand, I went in with faith that everything would be okay.
My experiences have given me not only the scientific and clinical exposure to solidify my passion to pursue a career in medicine, but also the personal experience to empathize with what patients are going through. Medical school would allow me the opportunity to enrich my understanding of the human body and the complex systems throughout it. I strive to look deeper into questions that have yet to be answered. I also hope to bridge the gap between new research and the dissemination of this new knowledge, as well as the treatments that may result from it, to those who would most benefit from it. At the end of the day, I hope to one day offer a steady hand to those who need it and be able to say, with a clear voice and the authority of someone with deep understanding of the human body and its biological processes, “It’s going to be okay.""","My family immigrated from Nagaland when I was three. I grew up in the US, but there are times when I feel like I do not fit in. The first time we could afford to visit Nagaland was when I was 15. I thought that a missing piece would fall in place among my people. Unfortunately, that was not the case. After years of speaking in English, my Ao language skills were lacking. Not that it made a difference, though. Everyone said they could tell I was American before I even opened my mouth. ‚ÄúIt's in the way you walk,‚Äù they said. _x000D_
It is tough to feel like you do not fit in anywhere. This is why I try to be accepting of others and proudly share my culture with others. The more I met and interacted with people from different backgrounds through my university, volunteering, and clinical experiences, I realized that the beauty of diversity is that we do not need to share the same history in order to relate. We simply need to be accepting of both our similarities and differences alike.","I served as the co-director of the dance ministry at my church. The program offered free dance lessons every Saturday to children in the community. Most of the children who attended the lessons could not afford to take part in extracurricular activities otherwise. This ministry served a cause that was close to my heart because I had a similar experience growing up. When I moved to New Hampshire, I was excited to hear that my church had this dance program. I enthusiastically joined as a dancer and volunteered to help with outreach events. _x000D_
I became director after a couple years of attending as a dancer. I made sure to continue to provide the dancers with a safe space that was free of judgment.

My responsibilities were simple and centered on achieving my own educational and personal goals. However, this focus of my daily life shifted significantly during the spring of my junior year of high school.

My mother often complained about bouts of lightheadedness and struggled to get out of bed. She dismissed our concerns, determined to excel at the job sponsoring her immigration visa. After a period of prolonged worsening symptoms and inconclusive tests in 2017, the severity of this situation grew. With my father’s demanding full-time job and older siblings away at college, I unquestionably saw it as my duty to step up. I was determined to assist with my mother’s essential daily tasks and took responsibility for maintaining the needs of our family. I sat with her during waves of fatigue, listening as she described longing to get out of bed and go about her day without growing faint but, ultimately, becoming frustrated at her inability to do so. It was during these moments that I understood my own role in my mother’s recovery. Recovery is not a solo endeavor but rather one in which individuals need both medical and emotional support to heal.

After many futile referrals, Dr. Deshpande, a cardiac electrophysiologist, was quick to acknowledge the validity of her symptoms and assured my mother that he would find an answer. He soon diagnosed her with Dysautonomia and patiently explained the physiology of the disease, why her symptoms were presenting at this stage in her life, and the possible treatment options. He was trying to understand what my mother felt, both physically and emotionally, and convey that understanding to us. While I have always had an interest in medicine, observing Dr. Deshpande’s approach to patient care as I accompanied my mom on these visits was the moment when I concretely understood the fundamental qualities a physician must have.

Inspired by my mother’s diagnosis and my grandfather’s concurrent diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease, I chose to study neuroscience at Northwestern. I was eager to understand the scientific perspective behind these conditions. Classroom discussions about both the autonomic nervous system affected in Dysautonomia and the neurodegeneration resulting in Alzheimer’s Disease broadened my awareness of the neurological mechanisms of my family members’ illnesses. My desire for comprehension of these pathologies drove my initial interest in conducting research with the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease. Beyond learning to stain and analyze tissue samples, I found myself seizing every opportunity beyond the bench to learn from the center’s clinicians and ask questions regarding their study participants and how individuals have unique experiences despite receiving the same Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Ultimately, keeping the stories of these patients, whose care depended on this biological research, at the forefront of my mind fuelled my drive to understand these neurobiological pathways and personally contribute to the medical research effort.

Enticed by the ways scientifically defined conditions present beyond either textbook or lab, I began volunteering on a patient floor at Saint Francis Hospital in Evanston to continue serving and supporting individuals receiving medical care. Trusted to independently round on each patient at the beginning of my morning shift, I made it my goal to directly ensure each patient’s needs, ranging from requests for blankets to questions for their medical team, were adequately met. One notable response to a patient’s call light presented me with a middle-aged man sitting up in his bed and struggling to tear open a packet of sugar. Exasperated, he explained how his recent diagnosis with incomplete quadriplegia left him with difficulty grasping objects and, therefore, prevented him from independently preparing his own cup of coffee. As I finished opening the packet and stirred in a splash of milk, I listened as he voiced both his frustration at the sudden loss of independence and greater anxieties about his future. Despite calling upon the skills I had acquired during similar conversations with my mother to put this patient at ease, I recognized the limitations to the support I could provide as a volunteer. I could not cure his paralysis nor could I offer solutions for his post-hospital stay care. I could only momentarily help him feel heard and supported. It is through pursuing a career as a physician that I hope to actively treat medical ailments and provide higher-level care.

While it was my family’s personal interaction with medical care that initially drew me to healthcare, it was my experiences interacting with patients, research clinicians, and doctors that cemented my goal of serving others specifically as a practicing physician. This role will allow me to pursue in-depth knowledge through education and research, and actively apply that knowledge to enhance patient care. Further, beyond my desire to console patients during their treatment, I want to take responsibility for this treatment and their outcomes, and ensure I have done everything in my power to improve patients’ quality of life.","It is undeniable that rowing significantly lacks racial and socioeconomic diversity. Hoping to confront the long-standing barriers preventing this I worked with North Channel Community Rowing (NCCR) to introduce Evanston and Skokie middle schoolers of diverse backgrounds to the sport by providing free rowing and swimming camps. Beyond teaching technique on the water, I prioritized getting to know the athletes and ensuring that they felt welcome at the boathouse. As they described their excitement to share camp anecdotes with parents and friends and encourage them to also try the sport, I came to understand the importance of racial representation in rowing. Without camps such as NCCR, these athletes may have never been exposed to crew thus depriving many demographics of academic and life opportunities made available through rowing. Creating space for individuals of all populations is therefore essential to producing a sustained change in making opportunities accessible for all.","Despite proper nutrition being a seemingly simple way to manage one‚Äôs health, individuals of marginalized cultural or socioeconomic groups often do not have equitable access to this. To combat this, I worked with Community Health Corps to develop an obesity prevention curriculum for community events organized by Erie Family Health Center. After initially presenting on nutrition labels, balanced meals, and exercise I reexamined if our work considered the backgrounds of those the center serves. As Erie‚Äôs Evanston and Skokie branch particularly assists a predominantly Spanish-speaking community and individuals of lower socioeconomic status, we presented healthier and affordable alternatives to ingredients commonly used in the cultural diets of the center‚Äôs guests and further researched how SNAP benefits could effectively be used locally to support healthier living. I hope to continue with organizations like Erie to create upholding change through increasing access to health information.",,,1,"Unable to continue volunteering at a memory care facility nor find a physician that would allow shadowing, I volunteered in a dental office where I helped to limit the spread of the virus by sanitizing exam rooms prior to every patient. While I am not interested in a career in dentistry, I was grateful for the opportunity to work directly with patients and healthcare providers in a clinic setting. As I moved back home and observed my pulmonologist father return from treating Covid-19 patients daily in the ICU the gravity of the pandemic became clear. By witnessing the emotional burden of losing patients weigh on my father and observing him remove himself from common rooms out of fear of spreading this unfamiliar illness to our family, I noted the deep compassion and sacrifice he demonstrated as a physician.

Better yet, how do we determine the ‘why’ behind our choice? Growing up, I told my parents, “I want to be a doctor,” to which they responded, “bueno, échale ganas, hijo.” The following week, I wanted to be a dentist. The week after that, a professional baseball player. Their response never changed, regardless of how many times my career choice did. Albeit I was a child with no clue as to the steps it took to achieve these professions, their response was always “échale ganas,” which is colloquial for telling someone to work hard. When they were children, they did not have the luxury of getting to decide what they wanted to become. They abandoned school at a young age to support their parents financially. Ultimately, they decided to leave their home country with aspirations of bettering their own lives and those of their future families. For that very reason, they supported whatever I decided to be.
However, who I was going to be was an obstacle in and of itself. I had little guidance, as neither my parents nor family members attended college. All they were familiar with was manual labor and endless hours. Although this was the case, I had to take the luxury I was granted as an opportunity. 
My first exposure to the world of medicine revolved around my mother’s diagnosis of diabetes. She developed gestational diabetes during her pregnancy with me, which resulted in higher birth weight. I weighed in at nine pounds, 15 ounces; meanwhile, my siblings weighed less than nine pounds when they were born. In 2016, my mom was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My curiosity grew, accompanied by my concern. Would my mom be okay? Would she continue to live her life the way she has? I knew little to nothing about the disease at the time, how it manifested, or how it would affect her and our family. Life seemed to proceed normally as weeks went on, and I accompanied her to many of her appointments in hopes that I could learn more and hear good news. However, I began to notice changes in her health. Unfortunately, she started gaining weight and feeling very lethargic. The worst symptom she expressed was profuse pain over the numbness in her feet. Learning about peripheral neuropathy in diabetics overwhelmed me with fear, as I read it could lead to an amputation. 
In the Summer of 2016, my mom began taking medications and altering her lifestyle. My family and I made sure she adhered to her prescriptions, and our diets changed per her needs. Although numbness and pain lingered, I knew she was on the right path. I began driver’s education and had class every day during the Summer. One weekday as I walked to class, I felt a sharp pain in my lower right abdomen. Soon, the pain was amplified by every step. The only way to manage the pain was with short and quick breaths. I Googled what the discomfort could stem from and read that appendicitis is one possibility. Once I was home, I quickly told my mom, “I have appendicitis.” She noticed me in distress and called our doctor. We were seen that same day; however, my doctor could not make recommendations without imaging. He sent me to receive a CAT scan, in which my makeshift diagnosis was confirmed: I had appendicitis. The doctor called Edward Hospital and scheduled an emergency surgery to remove my appendix. 
	Before these experiences, no career grasped my attention for long. I knew I wanted to go to college and make something of myself, but nothing inspired me. Witnessing my mom endure diabetes, the plethora of medications she was prescribed, and the lifestyle changes she implemented piqued my curiosity more than anything else had. Attending her appointments with her and experiencing the patient-physician interactions firsthand provided insight into the medical field. I listened to the doctor’s orders and ensured my mom followed them to a tee. With my own experience being admitted, I gained an alternative perspective as the patient rather than a family member. The doctors who were able to see me that same day prevented worse outcomes and treated me with the utmost care. The ability to have been seen, treated, and sent home within 24 hours was the last push I needed to decide medicine was what I wanted to pursue. 
	Today, my mom’s A1C is in a healthy range, her blood sugar is controlled, and she is living a healthy life. I have had nothing but positive experiences in healthcare and have witnessed how doctors can not only aid physical health but improve an individual’s overall quality of life. After all of the changes in career paths as a child and affirmations from my parents, I finally had a decision set in stone. I credit these two experiences for introducing me to medicine and reinforcing my passion. Although they began negatively, my experiences acquainted me with perspective. I aspire to be like the doctors that cared for my mom and me - showing compassion and commitment to the betterment of patients’ health. Whether it is someone with diabetes, a child with an inflamed appendix, or any other unfortunate circumstance, I want to be able to lend my help and “écharle ganas,” as my parents would tell me.","Coming from a Mexican background, I have the privilege of being immersed in two differing cultures: Illinois and Mexico. While growing up in Aurora, a culturally diverse city, I made friends from other Hispanic and Asian, African, and European cultures. In addition, going to my parents' hometowns in Mexico allowed me to connect with my culture on a deeper level. Much of their healthcare depends on home remedies, which starkly contrasts with the healthcare we rely on here. I have seen family members combat the common cold with teas comprised of lemon, ginger, and many more ingredients. My parents often utilized these methods on my siblings and me growing up. Bringing these experiences back with me and sharing them with my friends, I realized that many cultures outside the states depend on these traditional methods. That connection provided the opportunity to empathize with their culture and recognize the need for modern healthcare in many countries worldwide. ","As an older brother, I am responsible for caring for and teaching my younger sisters. I am often the guide they look upon and base their decisions on, so I strive to be the best version of myself. Growing up, my mom worked the second shift at her job, meaning she would be gone all afternoon, and my dad would often come home around 5 PM or later. Their absence meant my brother and I were responsible for caring for our sisters, helping them with their homework, and sometimes, cooking for them. In taking on the caretaker role, I learned responsibility and played a significant role in shaping my sisters. The values my parents instilled in me: compassion, dedication, and hard work, were then passed on to my sisters through me. In doing so, I helped my sister get into college, where she is currently studying sonography and medical imaging. I also continue to tutor my youngest sister as she is entering her eighth-grade year.

Those small gestures connected us during these frightful times, and I sincerely appreciate them. However, being sent home because of the pandemic also ended my volunteering experience at Carle Foundation Hospital.

Pushing aside the littering of orange and yellow autoinjectors, I oriented myself to the patient, ensuring I would be able to safely examine her. “She’s tachypneic and tachycardic,” I told my teammates.  I initiated the respiratory protocol, opening the side pocket of the equipment bag and reaching for epinephrine. When the patient told me that she had already injected herself with 6 pens of epinephrine, I froze. 

    As my patient’s wide eyes met mine, I learned that my reaction was the most vital aspect of care. All I could do in that moment was be there for my patient, allowing her to trust me as I monitored vital signs and delivered oxygen. As I encouraged her to focus on breathing, I noticed her tight grip on my hand loosening and her breaths starting to match mine. In that moment, calming the patient facilitated her to slow her respiration rate and feel more comfortable. In situations like these, I wanted my patients to feel a sense of control. I realized that this could be achieved through a foundation of trust and mutual understanding.

    Despite the stress of the call, what I remember most vividly is the way my patient looked at me throughout the call. As I first arrived on scene, I saw her pupils dart across the room as she searched for solace amongst the chaos. This fear is understandable, as for many people, medical settings can feel overwhelming and impersonal. It is a provider’s duty to give patients a sense of clarity in the face of uncertainty. As I thought of how I could extend this clarity to my own patient, I remembered my own pediatrician, handing me a pulse oximeter to place on my finger as a child. I felt a sense of comfort as he explained what the numbers meant and my enthralled eyes moved up and down, following the waves displaying my heart rate. I knew that my patient felt powerless among the oxygen tanks and stethoscopes. I wanted to show her how regulating her breathing could make her feel more in control and at ease. 

    I have found that the importance of giving patients control over decisions and actions affecting their health extends to research settings as well. In the Aravamuthan Lab, I work to understand the manifestations of dystonia, a form of underdiagnosed Cerebral Palsy. In the clinic, I saw how the physician’s extensive experience informed their thorough evaluations, but ultimately, a dystonia diagnosis was grounded in the experiences of the patients and their families.

    The patients in the clinic identified certain movements and postures that they perceived as dystonic and were able to work with the physician to confirm which type of Cerebral Palsy they had. The physicians made it clear from the start that parents and families best understood the effects of these abnormal muscle contractions on their children. As a result, they asked detailed questions to understand how they could best address the needs of their patients. At the end of each visit, I witnessed the satisfaction of the parents in their eyes as they first looked at their child and then at each other, letting out a sigh of relief. 

    Inspired by the collaborative nature of care I observed in a research setting, I have aimed to extend the same comfort to patients I interact with in other contexts. During my time serving as a research assistant in the pediatric emergency department, I obtained consent from patients and their families to be enrolled in research studies. For children especially, emergency rooms can be terrifying. Seeing firsthand how patients benefited from involvement in their own diagnostic processes, I wanted to make sure the children were given the same sense of agency while being enrolled in research studies. I noticed that when I first walked into the room, the child would often be looking down at the floor or at a phone. Speaking directly to the child and making sure they understood my role by using understandable terminology shifted the child’s eye line, raising it to meet mine. This assured me that their involvement in the enrollment process made them feel confident and secure.

    In medical school, I hope to become immersed in the collaborative nature of medicine and learn how to address patient needs at a deeper, more complex level.  I want to learn how to use holistically-informed objective knowledge to address patient needs while considering patient identity and specific life circumstances. While training to be a physician, I will not only learn about the pathophysiology of disease, but also how to more fully understand how these illnesses affect patients and their families. My experiences have taught me that research and the practice of medicine are most productive when the goals align with the needs of the patients. Combining my passion for learning about scientific processes and quantitative reasoning with strong interpersonal connections will allow me to empower patients in their medical decisions. I aspire to become a physician because I want to meet patients where they are, in clinical medicine and in research.","The summer after my freshman year of college, I interned at Nemours Children's Hospital, where I got to assist physicians at a nearby clinic built for Amish families. I quickly saw how all my preconceived notions about the Amish rejecting biomedicine were misconstrued. I saw how parents with no formal education were so well-versed in describing their child‚Äôs complex medical needs. I saw the difficult compromises the families had to make to reconcile their beliefs and values with the medical advice of the doctors. I learned that although the Amish families had different views than patient populations I typically interacted with, they shared the same goal: to give their children the best quality of life possible. When assisting in performing hearing tests for the patients, I encouraged questions and explained every step of the process, establishing a foundation of trust and understanding. This allowed for the patients to feel comfortable in voicing their concerns._x000D_
","After graduation, I started working at the Cerebral Palsy Clinic at Washington University. While creating a standardized patient intake survey for research purposes, I had extensive conversations with families about what their goals were for each visit. I learned that many families had concerns about a lack of access to physical therapy services and difficulty with transportation to and from appointments. I realized that the survey I was developing could also be used to serve as a tool to connect patients with resources to reduce barriers to therapy access. In the survey, I created a section that allowed families to indicate which therapies they were having trouble accessing and whether they needed assistance enrolling in early intervention programs. These results informed how the clinic social worker prioritized spending time discussing transportation options with families and showed physicians how to contact school programs to advocate for their patients to receive more therapy._x000D_
",,,1,"During the pandemic, I volunteered at Almost Home, a shelter in St. Louis, which provides resources to young moms in need. While speaking to the moms, I learned about how inequities in COVID-19 care were exacerbated by the historically oppressive nature of the St. Louis healthcare system. Many of the moms were from North St. Louis, a predominantly black community. This area had a severe shortage of testing sites. Those that contracted COVID had exacerbated symptoms due to underlying conditions that they were not receiving routine care for. Compounding lack of treatment for underlying conditions and unequal access to testing showed me how the effects of the pandemic were especially harmful for communities of color. The moms showed me that it is a physician's duty to advocate for their patients in times of crisis. This perspective will inform my motivations as a physician. I will aim to secure a foundation of trust and equitable access in order to benefit patients and their communities.",0,1,1

During the Physics 1 final, I attempted to access information while taking the exam, which was not permitted. I was caught doing so and reported to the Dean of Students. A few months later, during the fall semester, I had a meeting with the Dean and the instructor of the course, where we discussed my transgressions and what the consequences would be. I was placed on Academic Probation, had a mark of Academic Dishonesty placed on my record, and wrote a two page essay detailing what I had done wrong, the lessons I had learned, and what I would do if I was to be placed in that situation again. This was the biggest mistake I have made in my academic career, and I deeply regret having made it. After going through that process, I have done everything I could to compensate for the mistake, and have grown both academically and personally. I hope to continue to grow as a student and person and to avoid making bad decisions such as academic dishonesty again.",0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,7350,600.0,,1000.0,1600.0,400.0,1,1000,1,2000,04/29/2022,University of Illinois at Chicago,Economics,0,,No,No,No,"$150,000 - 174,999",6,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,15,Adequate,2,2023,3,6.0,0.5,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,"It was my freshman year of high school, and I was outmatched in the last round of a wrestling match against my strongest opponent. Heaving and sweating, I was ready to give in, and then I remembered my coach’s advice, “if you’re outmatched, you have to think out of the box, catch your opponent with something they’ve never seen before”. I use my opponents' confidence against him, giving him an opening to attack, and use his momentum to flip positions and land on top of him. Upon landing on top of him and keeping him pinned, I heard the referee call my victory, and I ran to my celebrating teammates. Giving an opponent this skilled an opening would have been inadvisable, however because I did something that the opponent would have never predicted, I ultimately succeeded. This was a defining moment in my life because it made me realize that, with the right approach, any problem can be solved, no matter how unpredictable. This perspective would benefit me in college, when I decided to begin working as an ABA therapist with children who were diagnosed with autism. This was one of the most impactful experiences of my life, as I found a passion for healthcare, gained experience in patient care and interaction, and most importantly realized the healthcare disparities in the US, and their effect on people of different socioeconomic backgrounds. These disparities, whether it was due to financial restrictions, a lack of a support system, or lack of education regarding their child’s condition, often directly impacted the child’s progress. After witnessing these problems, I chose to pursue a career that could help prevent and solve them. After observing different health practitioners, I decided that I wanted to pursue medicine because of the problem-solving processes, the dynamic work environment, the effect physicians have on patients and, most importantly, I saw medicine as the most effective path to helping resolve the issues resulting from healthcare disparities. Medicine provides a great opportunity to treat lower-income populations while educating them on preventative measures that can be taken to avoid common health problems.
 
After choosing to pursue medicine, I began assisting in research at Dr. Brian Layden’s lab at UIC, where I learned various scientific processes such as assaying and extraction. I saw the potential of this work to improve our healthcare and experienced the meticulous process of conducting research. Research not only improves the quality and ability of our healthcare, but also can provide affordable and available healthcare options to disadvantaged communities. While working at the lab, I wrote a commentary on the effect of the gut microbiome on the body, and the noninvasive methods such as prebiotics, polyphenols, probiotics, diet adjustment, and the effect of those changes on gestation. I would like to continue healthcare related research both for improving our current processes and to make treatments more available. Combined with the clinical experience I would gain as a physician, I hope to be able to have a very positive impact on the community through the use of research.

In order to gain more experience in the medical field, I began working as a medical assistant at Dr. Altarshan’s clinic. This experience further illustrated the effects of healthcare disparities in the US, largely due to the diverse patient population of the clinic. A common example of this was the process of receiving authorization for the use of an insulin pump or sensor for a diabetic patient from insurance. Wealthier patients with good insurance were usually covered and able to receive these devices, while patients who did not have good insurance would not be able to receive the device. While inadequate healthcare is the most devastating factor to these communities, what is more frustrating is that these patients are often less informed of how to deal with their condition, and have less resources available to make impactful lifestyle changes. These are some of the issues I hope to address as a physician, both by providing more access to healthcare in the community and educating patients on affordable and preventative steps they can take to improve their health.
 
            The issues resulting from inadequate access to healthcare, while prevalent, can be limited and prevented if the right steps are taken. While the current approach to medicine is effective, using unconventional methods can be a more effective way for long term improvement of population health. I plan to contribute towards the improvement of healthcare discrepancies as a physician by providing easier access to healthcare, educating communities, and research into less invasive and more accessible preventative and responsive treatments. While the health issues affecting the disadvantaged are becoming more prevalent, approaching the issue in an unconventional way will have a positive impact and can be the first step to making major improvements on both a large scale and on a personal level.","Growing up I moved around different parts of the US as well as overseas, in the Emirates and in Syria, so I dealt with ever-changing cultures and values early in my life. I attended both private and public schools while in the US, and this gave me a wider perspective from meeting vastly different groups in these schools. My most eye-opening experience, however, was volunteering for IMAN, a non-profit organization on the south side of Chicago. While working with IMAN, I met prostitutes with HIV who would get hired by people looking to receive the disease from them on purpose. The reason for this was because those hiring often did not have access to treatments for other conditions that they had, and by receiving HIV they would be eligible for better healthcare. Even more alarming was how common this was in those communities. This was eye-opening as I witnessed the extremes people have to go through to receive treatment, and have never had to deal with growing up.","While volunteering for my mosque, we participated in different programs to give back to the community, including soup kitchens, fundraisers, and community events. Through my mosque, I began volunteering for IMAN and gained my first experience of working in programs aimed at making long-term change, as most of the programs at my mosque were relief programs. These programs addressed the lack of hospitals, grocery stores, and clinics in those communities, and a general lack of resources to maintain a healthy lifestyle in the inner city. I experienced the hurdles in trying to provide relief and improvement to these people‚Äôs lives since certain changes could have unintended and detrimental side effects on the community. One example of this is IMAN‚Äôs goal to reform corner stores in the inner city to provide healthier options for residents. However, the corner store owners take a loss by doing so, and the corner store initiative was aimed at incentivizing owners to provide these options.",,,1,"Before the pandemic, I relied on classroom-style teaching and the teacher‚Äôs ability to learn most subjects. However, the pandemic forced me to learn how to study on my own as a result of asynchronous classes. The pandemic forced me to hold myself more accountable, as well as organize and plan my day to complete my day-to-day responsibilities efficiently. These included academic and work responsibilities, family obligations, the volunteer and research programs that I was involved in, and staying in shape physically and mentally. This later helped me effectively study for the MCAT while working and doing research, and still taking care of family and personal obligations. Although I had significantly less time to study for the MCAT my second time as a result of increased work hours, I was able to improve my MCAT score by six points. The pandemic also gave me space to focus on myself what my strengths were as well as where I can improve as a person.",1,0,1

I stand in a fluorescent clinic room at North Shore Center for Medical Aesthetics, barely breathing as I discuss the news. It is here, in the midst of taking histories and charting visits as a medical assistant, that I grow into my commitment to heal. The patient pulls me in, and I am taken back to a flicker of memory. The memory that first brought me into this room and medicine.

I see my grandfather. I recall a warm smile - him pushing me on a bamboo swing. I see an afternoon of chess, his patience as he teaches me. His calloused but gentle hands as he holds me through heartbreak. What I remember most poignantly are his physicians  – praising his positive attitude and reassuring me that they would provide optimal care for him. Their unwavering acts of encouragement eased my mind about his lung cancer treatment and inspired me to view medicine, not always as a cure, but as a way to offer others hope. My grandfather’s prognosis improved as the chemotherapy and radiation eliminated his tumors and we celebrated.

Our happiness was fleeting, as one night, my grandfather slipped and passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage. His death was so sudden that it was difficult for my family to accept he was truly gone. My aunt most visibly struggled to process her father’s death, as she spiraled into a depression. I offered my support as we processed the grief together. While I could not be at her side because of COVID-19, I kept in touch with her virtually every day. In the hospital, I noticed patients with empty chairs next to them. Although my aunt was fortunate enough to have a strong support system, I realized that not everyone has this privilege. I came to understand that there were people out battling journeys alone, who could use another presence to lean on. They relied on the healthcare professionals alone for strength and comfort. Supporting my aunt through the grieving process and seeing how the medical team provided solace to other patients moved me. I realized it could be my way to serve as emotional support for more people.

As a crisis counselor for the Crisis Text Line, I met Jane – a sexual assault victim who was struggling over the news of her pregnancy. It was against her culture’s beliefs to terminate her pregnancy, but she did not want to live with the constant reminder of her trauma. Together, we saw it was possible to create a plan that aligned with her beliefs and allowed her to be happy. We identified her support system and found activities she could do to find peace, like hiking and meditating. We found long-term support in therapy and a community forum. She agreed to stay safe from suicide until discussing the next steps with her physician. Through helping Jane, I understood the deep connection between mental and physical health. It allowed me to learn what I truly wanted: a lifetime of carrying forward the treasured bonds present in every fold of medicine. I hope to become a physician to heal a person physically, while also being there for them as a companion and guide in their weakest times. No other profession provides this gift – of offering the courage to fight battles, just like my grandfather’s physicians uplifted the spirits of my family.

And so, I strived to gain more insight into the patient-physician relationship by helping underserved populations with the diagnostic side of medicine. As an intake volunteer at Avicenna Community Health Center, I met “Mr. Lopez.” At our first encounter, he arrived pounding his fists. Having just left the previous hospital against medical advice after his COVID-19 diagnosis, he felt as though the doctor there “did not respect him.” Before getting his history, I looked at his chart and saw that he was Spanish-speaking. Even as I tried to slow down my words, he still shook his head in frustration. I saw a gap in communication and understanding. Talking through it with my physician mentor, she immediately saw this too and reached out to a Spanish-speaking physician for follow-up. I admired her compassion for the patient – encased in her leadership skills was humility. She realized that achieving the best outcome for the patient needed evaluation from multiple perspectives, even when that meant another physician would serve Mr. Lopez better. I reflected on the responsibility a physician has for their patient’s treatment plan – to go beyond physical symptoms by exploring lifestyle factors and emotional states. I aspire to do the same as a physician, tailoring treatment to match the patient’s individual needs, which are shaped by a multitude of factors.

With glistening eyes, I snap back into the present moment. I stand in the room, clasping my patient’s hand as they process their melanoma diagnosis. I know they are in pain, but I stand firm. Through witnessing my grandfather’s treatment, supporting individuals in crisis, and helping physicians provide holistic care in underserved areas, I found a love of medicine. I am committed to becoming a compassionate physician to serve both the emotional and physical injuries of patients of diverse backgrounds, like my grandfather, Jane, and Mr. Lopez, and find personalized solutions that will care for the whole person, not just their symptoms.","As an Indian-American, my musical recollections involved learning top Billboard radio songs and Carnatic Classical Music, a form of traditional singing. Therefore, when I began volunteering with children who had a hearing or speaking impairment at the Carle Oral and Auditory School, my blended experiences guided me in teaching music. ‚ÄúMaria‚Äù was a five-year-old, Spanish-speaking girl I worked with. As she started singing ‚ÄúComo La Flor,‚Äù I admired how she proudly shared her music with others. Through music, I was able to connect with her by using her favorite song to explain the concepts: beat, rhythm, and pitch. I not only learned that music is universal as it bridges cultures together, but also that teaching extends beyond just conveying knowledge. Instead, it should be customized to the individual and how they best learn. I hope to continue applying this knowledge by creating personalized music playlists to connect with elderly patients as part of the Musical Minds Project at Rush.","‚ÄúI‚Äôm laying on the bathroom floor, crying uncontrollably and I can‚Äôt stop.‚Äù ‚ÄúAmy,‚Äù a twelve-year-old girl struggling to process the death of her mother, texted me this while I was volunteering for the Crisis Text Line.

Prior to that moment, everything I learned about seemed to have an explanation. That changed when I began taking more advanced courses and started asking questions that have yet to be answered. I realized these unanswered questions are the reason physicians continue learning long after medical school. Ever since I was a patient myself, I have been driven to learn more about medicine. My experiences working in the hospital, job shadowing, and engaging in research have demonstrated the potential uncertainty that accompanies medicine. This only reinforced my desire to learn more so someday I could also help people live healthier lives.

Like any patient, when I began feeling sick my senior year of high school, I hoped for a simple explanation and an easy treatment. Unfortunately, it was almost a year before I received a diagnosis that explained why I was feeling ill and required gallbladder surgery. Although my GI doctor felt that my gallbladder was causing my discomfort, the CT scans, an endoscopy, a gastric emptying study, and a HIDA scan did not show strong evidence. While waiting for additional tests, I tried numerous medications and special diets. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of not knowing what was wrong was terrifying. Eventually, another GI specialist concurred with my GI doctor that my gallbladder should be removed.

With this second opinion, we searched for a surgeon willing to remove a gallbladder from someone so young without conclusive test results. I will never forget the surgeon who agreed to remove my gallbladder. He was scheduled to leave for vacation but came in the morning after my graduation to perform the surgery so I would not have to wait any longer. I was thankful for the physicians and the surgeon who were able to provide me a diagnosis and treatment. I knew someday I also wanted to be able to give patients an explanation for their illnesses and alleviate their discomfort.

After reflecting on my experiences, I know that my experience as a patient has helped me become a better nursing assistant. I had the opportunity to meet a diverse patient population and hear their stories, while noticing that numerous patients had experiences mirroring my own. In high school, I was the patient seeking answers but now I was on the care team helping patients through their uncertainty while they waited for their answers. I remember trying to distract anxious patients by taking them for walks while they waited for their results and hoped I could be more involved in their diagnosis and treatment in the future.

My favorite part about working on the cardiac unit was when patients discharged from the hospital because it meant that the patient finally had an explanation for their discomfort and was in the process of being treated. Sadly, as a CNA, once a patient was discharged from the hospital, I never had the opportunity to learn if they fully recovered. Alternatively, my experiences job shadowing gave me the opportunity to witness physicians who were able to offer follow-up treatment for even years after their patient was discharged from the hospital and hear the end of their patients' stories.

While working in the hospital, I also learned that we are not always certain of the cause of a patient's illness and there is not always a known treatment. The opportunity to answer some of these unanswered questions is why I, like many physicians, engage in research and why research is significant to me. Like medicine, research is not always straightforward, and I quickly learned we might not get the answer we expect. While working in the genetic cardiology lab, we hypothesized that by knocking out the SLGT1 gene in the heart by injecting mice with Tamoxifen, we could prevent genetically predisposed mice from developing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Unfortunately, two of the mice had heart attacks during the echocardiogram and we saw they had cardiomyopathy. This was unexpected because our hypothesis was that disease progression was largely dictated by SLGT1, but there seemed to be another explanation. Even though we did not get the answer we expected, we did discover that knocking out the gene at least slows the disease progression. We are now investigating the mechanism in which SLGT1 in the heart contributes to glycogen buildup in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This example demonstrates why I enjoy research, because with the results of each experiment, new questions arise. When answered, this has the potential to generate new explanations and make many patients' lives easier.

After gaining an understanding for why physicians continue learning long after medical school, I recognized how these unanswered questions related to my own experience as a patient, how my awareness of the uncertainty of medicine helped me relate to patients, and how the opportunity to continue learning and inquiring is why engaging in research has been significant to me. The uncertainty and quickly evolving information provided by the medical field ensures that each day will be different. I know that each day will present its own questions to be answered, challenges, and opportunities, which is why I am choosing to pursue the journey towards becoming a physician.","While working as a nursing assistant on the cardiac, intensive care, and COVID-19 units, I had the opportunity to meet numerous patient populations. I met patients whose lives were challenged by addiction, dementia, financial hardship, and chronic illness. I empathized with all individuals, understanding that each patient has unique challenges that contribute to their health status, no matter what culture they identify with. I recognized the importance of caring for the whole person, including understanding when referrals to community resources were necessary to address a patient‚Äôs access to care and mental wellbeing. Even though I encountered a very different patient population while volunteering at a free mobile clinic than I did at the hospital, the same was true for these patients. My experiences have prepared me for working with diverse populations and I would look forward to joining Rush in striving for health equity in the community.","I had the opportunity to volunteer with incredible organizations aiming to positively impact health in their community when I traveled to Louisville, Kentucky with the Public Health Service Committee. In Louisville, we were able to address disparities in many social determinants of health. For example, we addressed food insecurity by packing backpacks of food for students, planting vegetable seeds, and cooking meals. After taking a determinants of health course, I realized that in Louisville I had also witnessed how disparities in social determinants such as housing and education can negatively impact health literacy and support systems that then negatively impact health outcomes. Once back in Iowa, I began volunteering with the mobile clinic because their mission to provide free healthcare resonated with me after witnessing disparities in access to healthcare in Louisville. Now I aim to positively impact factors that influence health in my own community as well.",,,1,"During the pandemic, I was able to continue taking courses, perform research in two labs, volunteer with the mobile clinic, and keep both jobs at the hospital. Job shadowing in the clinic was limited, but that just increased my excitement to begin shadowing again last summer.

This fall, however, we held our Light the Night event in person, and it made seeing the leukemia survivors interact with each other for the first time since the pandemic even more meaningful. My job as a nursing assistant at my local hospital was the aspect of my life most impacted by COVID-19.

The sun was glaring, and my hands were red from carrying lukewarm water bottles. Yet at that moment, all I could see were his rough bandages. I was doing outreach when my team came across “Jared,” a housing-insecure male who had recently been treated for injuries on his body. I watched the sweat drip down his neck and into his gauze, which had fused into his skin. Unable to shelter from the heat or find transportation to the hospital, his bandages had remained unchanged and his wounds were infected. By the time we arrived, Jared was doubled over in pain. I stood there, water bottle in hand, unable to do anything. Helpless. I knew the outreach I was doing was only temporary—a band-aid solution, but as I sat with him I realized I could do absolutely nothing but hold his hand and wait until our street medicine team arrived. My body itched to do more, but I couldn’t.

As the physicians attended to Jared, I saw the pain in his eyes subside. His grip on my hand loosened and my heart filled with warmth as I watched the doctors do what my water bottle couldn’t. They not only treated his wounds, but asked him about his capacity to care for his wounds, ensured him access to a tent, and taught his neighbors how to change his bandages. That day, it wasn’t the medical expertise of the physicians that gripped me—it was how they displayed patience and respect for Jared’s conditions, using their resources to nurture a space for him to regain agency over his health. Those physicians showed me how building trust and connections through compassion paves the road to better health, and that medicine is about providing care while giving the person autonomy to make decisions about their health. After years of working with the unhoused community, it dawned on me: this is why I want to become a doctor. Homelessness isn’t a housing crisis—it’s a healthcare crisis. And no one is better positioned to address it than the physician, who stands directly at the intersection of human biology and lived experiences. I realized that by practicing medicine in this form, I can truly serve as an advocate. I only hope that one day I embody the values that I saw in Jared's doctors.

Despite this realization, I didn’t always view medicine in this capacity. Growing up, I must have seen a hundred black-and-white angiograms flash across my dad’s computer, continually fascinated by how as the catheter cleared the artery, it became darker, blood gushing through, giving life to the person on the table. The way science and life wove together intrigued me, and I was consumed with trying to understand how one person could impact the life of another in this way. Suffice it to say, it was my dad’s cardinal identity as a doctor that was my catalyst for pursuing medicine. However, as I grew older, I realized that my initial reasons for wanting to pursue medicine weren’t misguided, but simply naive. I didn’t understand the tug that I felt towards it until that day with Jared, and until I started working with underserved and unhoused communities. I came to realize that every relationship and experience that I’ve had case-working only further compelled me to pursue medicine.

In one instance, while volunteering at a clinic for housing-insecure folks, I came across “Mo”. That day I was in charge of foot washing, and as we waited for the water to warm, we struck up a conversation. Before I knew it, we were throwing our heads back, laughing, like we'd known each other forever. As the timer for the water went off, I asked Mo if I could remove her shoes, and suddenly, she went silent. Her gaze shifted to the floor, and she tucked her feet under her. She was in pain, and her feet were swollen, but she was embarrassed. I moved the water and kneeled down, meeting her eyes. My heart broke as she told me why she was hesitant to get her feet checked. She had recently become unhoused and could no longer afford a doctor. We sat there, talking for hours. While no soap suds were formed that day, what formed was a bond built on trust, vulnerability, and respect. After, I got a clinic doctor to check her, and I’ll never forget her smile when she came in the next week, ready to get her feet washed. In those moments, I realized the importance of creating safe spaces and recognizing our common humanity. What happened that day was healing, and it only motivated me further to become a physician. As a doctor, I hope to one day have the honor to nurture these spaces, where individuals trust me to share their stories and vulnerabilities—and heal together.

Through my experiences, I have learned the value of validating an individual’s lived experiences, but I am also realizing that as a student I can do only that. Through medicine, this validation can lead to real, tangible impacts on health. Whether it be facing intense moments like Jared’s, or experiencing heartfelt connections like Mona’s, I have grappled with four years of frustration, anger, and disbelief, as I watched the systems around us erase the rights of these communities. It is this frustration that has pushed me to pursue medicine. As a physician, I can truly stand in solidarity with them.","While working at a free clinic for uninsured individuals, I came across a woman: ‚ÄúJo‚Äù who confided that as a homeless female, it was impossible for her to receive quality care, leading her to view doctors and hospitals as untrustworthy. In defense, I began explaining how it wasn‚Äôt the doctors, but rather the restrictive policies placed upon them. Upon hearing this, Jo became upset, claiming that I didn‚Äôt understand her._x000D_
_x000D_
What I should‚Äôve done instead was empathize with Jo, recognizing that her experiences and identity led her to view situations differently than I did. In working with homeless communities, I‚Äôve learned that connecting with those unlike myself requires a belief in the dignity of all human beings‚Äì understanding that our unique life stories cause us to rightfully construct different narratives about the world. By recognizing, validating, and respecting these differences, I can better understand others and form valuable relationships built on mutual respect and trust.","Housing over 75 homeless residents, People‚Äôs Park in Berkeley was a vibrant space known for its tight-knit community and decades of advocacy supporting the homeless population. Yet in 2019, UC Berkeley announced plans to redevelop the park‚Äì threatening a space that many called home. Recognizing this, my peers and I organized social media and local campaigns, rallying support from community members and students alike. After months of negotiations, we forced the university to put its plans on hold, pushing it to find alternatives that wouldn‚Äôt jeopardize the unhoused community in the park. And while we hadn‚Äôt solved the broader issue of homelessness, through collective action we‚Äôd successfully advocated for and protected this ‚Äúhome‚Äù. This experience showed that while fighting against institutional entities and addressing systemic barriers can be frustrating and challenging, by finding support in the community around me, I can remain resilient, showing up and fighting for what matters.",,,1,"During the summer of 2020, I was slated to begin my internship at the Nemea Center for Classical Archaeology. Excavating pieces of pottery might seem boring, but for me, this was an exciting opportunity‚Äì one that would also allow me to earn units towards my degree. Yet, as the pandemic hit, I put these plans on hold. As director of an organization that provided essential services for the unhoused, adapting an in-person service organization during COVID to a remote one took priority, and by forming a coalition of over 20 community partners, we eventually adapted and streamlined much-needed services. In focusing on these goals, however, I ended up shifting my graduation by a semester and changing my plans for medical school, as I was unable to obtain my units. While this delay was unforeseen, caused by the sudden onset of COVID, my decision to focus on my responsibility as a director was a conscious one‚Äì one that I took after weighing my priorities and my commitments.",1,0,3

We spent hours on the streets holding signs chanting mottos that advocated for employers to provide health insurance to workers and their families. Amongst the crowd, I understood what she meant as each union member there was furious to a breaking point though continued to battle for improvement. As I grew up, I began to experience the hardships they spoke of. Whether that was witnessing the rationing of lifesaving chronic medication or outright ignoring comorbidities because they couldn’t afford the price that came with acknowledgment. Healthcare was evidently a privilege that so many, my family included, could not afford. It had become my personal vendetta to ensure that people were going to be of good health. Joining medicine had become my project because I could no longer stand witness to worsening conditions.

Back in 2017, my father had an intracranial aneurysm. The neurosurgeon had stated it was the biggest he had ever seen. They had operated on my father only because the physician had ignored the insurance company’s scheduled date- which was over a week away. In the waiting room with my immediate family, the surgeon told me directly that he was sure the aneurysm would have ruptured had they operated any later. I knew from that moment that I had to continue this example. Choosing the path of becoming a physician was the only choice in my eyes. I wanted and continue to want these responsibilities to ensure that a person's well-being is never disregarded. 

I found opportunities such as tutoring children at underserved community centers and interpreting at Volunteers in Medicine of Southern Nevada. At this clinic, I empathized with the patient’s woes; their drained demeanors and constant visible fiscal concern reminded me of my family. I had begun to rectify the lack of help they had not received. It had been a privilege to remove linguistic barriers, establish continuity and see the positive progression of chronic conditions in patients, especially knowing that their demographic is mostly disadvantaged Spanish-speaking citizens who have not received healthcare for years. Though I had always been concerned with the physical and mental health of others, this exposure showed me how much I enjoy connecting with others while aiding them. It was so enjoyable that I’d illude myself to believe that I was not interpreting for the physician but that I was them, making it difficult to compartmentalize my giddy expression with professionalism. While continuously volunteering, some patients viewed me as one of their providers. They’d attempt to thank me for following their treatment for months; since physicians were rotating residents, I was a consistent face for them. I couldn’t overemphasize how rewarding it had been to see them live a happier and healthier life. Although my volunteer work made a difference, it never felt like a big enough impact was made on my community.

The emergency department showed me a lifetime of knowledge. First, it reaffirmed that the amount of contribution needed to our communities is direly vast. Secondly, it solidified my decision that I must be among the people who will fuel this change. Throughout the past three years of scribing, I have witnessed plenty, from the miracles feasible with modern medicine to the morbidities of debatably ignored demographics. Even before the pandemic, it was apparent that the less fortunate were suffering medically. Heartbreaking to understand why people would avoid seeking emergency care because if they survived this crisis, the financial one to follow would take them. I’d already lost count of the number of deaths I had seen, then the pandemic came and amplified the existing problems. The feeling of impotence was unbearable as I watched people die from the nurse’s station. Each late patient left me questioning why it happened; I’d spend weeks remembering patients, reiterating to myself that it didn’t have to. Those deaths should have been prevented. 

I seek a career in medicine to be able to combat the feeling of hopelessness that I had for months during the pandemic. In less than a decade, I hope to be curing people of diseases. As a physician, I want to remove people from their despondent state and remind them that they are people worth protecting, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Pursuing medicine never seemed obtainable coming from a Mexican household with immigrant parents, but now applying to medical school, I hope to show my underserved community that we all deserve a seat at the table of medicine. When I become a physician, I am going to treat the underserved citizens and not allow the next pandemic to reap on them. I have seen the effects of prophylaxis and know that I can’t wait to apply it to people to a higher degree than I am already attempting to.","I grew up in Las Vegas, one of the most diverse cities in the nation. From my developmental to young adult years, diversity has been my norm. It has made me accustomed to several cultures and appreciate each for its differences. From school to work, there‚Äôd be people from so many different backgrounds, and you could always find some way to relate to the others even if you couldn‚Äôt verbally communicate. A great example would be when I would attend rallies with my mother for the Culinary Union. The melting pot of the crowd was amazing, and to acknowledge that everyone present was advocating for one another was a warm feeling. Understanding and relating to people that vary from me has been a skill my upbringing taught me well. There is something that can always bring people together regardless of how drastic the difference may seem.","Throughout my years of service as an interpreter at Volunteers in Medicine of Southern Nevada- a clinic that provides free healthcare to underserved communities- I have had the privilege to establish continuity with several patients and watch their positive progression in health. Through my efforts, I have removed language barriers for both parties to get exacerbated comorbidities under control. _x000D_
Additionally, I have been investing in the future generation by tutoring elementary school children for the past three years. Not only does my tutoring relieve some stress from parents who cannot help due to educational, language, and time restrictions, but it helps establish good habits in the children. Throughout my years of tutoring, I have seen kids change their in-classroom classification from troublemakers to straight A students. These lasting effects on their educational career are evident and needed, considering how poorly Nevada consistently ranks in education.",,,1,"Noting how the pandemic impacted my life seems wrong because it was not disruptive as it could have been. I maintained my job, completed my undergraduate, and most of all, survived; I am immensely grateful._x000D_
Due to the pandemic, I watched dozens of people fight for gasps of air; while others took their last. Scribing in the emergency room was beyond mentally taxing. Intubations were frequent, but the number of patients coming off of them alive was not. Unsurprisingly my mental and physical health was negatively affected along with my academic performance.  _x000D_
Despite the hardships, I learned much about myself and prepared for the future. It taught me to nourish my support system through challenging times and emphasized the benefits of hobbies to reenergize. It amplified my gratitude and desire to help the underserved. It demonstrated how health disparities would remain without major intervention, which I intend to be a part of. It showed a tragedy we must never allow to reoccur.",1,0,2

From the disparity I saw between private and public hospitals in India's southern region, where patients were either in state-of-the-art hospital beds or left lying in the dirt. From the loss of life experienced in my hospice job, where families beg me for more time, and no amount of consoling can change a thing. From unanswered questions at the Minneapolis crisis nursery, when children hold on tightly to me as I cradle them to sleep. I can’t change where someone was born, how they were raised, their genetic conditions, or their income.  I can’t prevent what is inevitable. Yes, there are many things I can’t do, but I will do everything in my power to learn, heal, and understand nonetheless. My family, while none are in the medical field, instilled in me a belief that I should always listen to my heart, and never say “I can’t”. Advanced medical education and training will open the door to my career as a physician, where I will work to answer those unanswered questions and provide the care people deserve.  I have the will, determination, and perseverance to make a difference, and I am ready to get to work.

My time spent abroad studying the diverse healthcare system in India during January of 2020 was a multifaceted exposure to a completely new culture, and there was no rule book on how to approach it.  Seeing these cultural differences led me to a deeper level of understanding and admiration for other cultures. The realization that I have control over my perception of the world, and that my mindset is a powerful tool, has transformed my everyday life. I grew in my appreciation of other cultures and their tolerance and acceptance of diversity. This is very important in the increasingly diverse healthcare environment in the U.S. because health and illness are bound by cultural beliefs and practices. During my time in India, I was confronted with a level of disparity that I had never witnessed before. I walked through a public hospital, where emergency medicine doctors were tasked with seeing over 100 patients a day, where children were lying on the floor in their own excretions, and patients were packed into rooms like soldiers in barracks.   The private hospitals were modernized, clean, quiet, efficient, expensive, yet cold. While the public and private hospitals were not far apart geographically, they appeared to be worlds apart in terms of health care quality and human dignity. I cannot and will not facilitate such egregious disparities. After seeing such upsetting, discouraging sights, I know that there is absolutely no other path for me than that of a physician. 

The road I am choosing is certainly not an easy one, but it is necessary.  It would be a blessing to implement my passion for science, the human body, and the complexities of the mind in such a way that helps humanity. One small step in this direction was my experience applying for and receiving a fellowship grant established to promote environmental and social change locally and globally. Along with two other like-minded students from the University of Minnesota, I spent over a year learning from the native people of Kampala, Uganda about how mental health and wellness are practiced in their community. We partnered with a Ugandan business development firm to introduce health and wellness as a module in their new entrepreneurial skills course. Our goal was to educate and equip new entrepreneurs with culturally relevant, actionable strategies on the topic of wellness that would help them understand how building a healthier lifestyle builds a healthier business. In order to ensure the receptiveness of our module, we partnered with professionals in executive coaching and counseling native to Uganda to assist in the live delivery of the module. The feedback from the course participants was very positive: they wanted more. The humanity of seeing people open up about their struggles with mental health on the other side of the world and the gratitude that was expressed for the wellness strategies we provided was incredibly powerful. My takeaway from this experience was how to approach conversations without expectations, search for commonalities, and combine what is familiar with what is new in a palatable way.  These are skills I look forward to building in my career as a physician when interacting with not only patients but colleagues and mentors as well.   

Witnessing disparities in healthcare, both in my local community and abroad, has filled me with a sense of purpose.  I want to take action and continue my studies in science and healthcare towards a higher degree that I can use to one day treat all patients with dignity, regardless of their background. I am still in search of solutions to the problems with the current state of the healthcare system, and I strongly believe I will find some given the opportunity to pursue a career as a physician.  After all, it is not truly the anger that has driven me all this time, but the passion I have for helping others.","I have always considered myself highly respectful of others, but good intentions don‚Äôt always break the barriers between culture, language, and humility.  While abroad in India, I had to retrain my thought processes for how I approached conversations and experiences.  There was no precedent to compare something that was simply on a different plane from what I was used to, and I learned to approach every experience with a completely open mind and absorb as much information as I could about their culture to use as a reference point when comparing new pieces of information. I spent months prior to this experience researching the religious, spiritual, and cultural meaning behind certain topics so as to approach these new situations with true respect.  Through this open mindset, I was able to adapt and appreciate this intricate, diverse blend of cultures, and now have strong tools at my disposal that I can use to find commonalities and gain insight from people of many different backgrounds.","I received a fellowship grant in 2021 along with a team of like-minded individuals, and we had the goal of delivering a live, virtual course module on wellness and stress management education and strategies to female entrepreneurs in Kampala, Uganda.   We spent the better part of a year researching and communicating with experts in the United States on the topics of wellness, mental health, and stress management, along with contacts in Uganda, to hold a progressive discussion with these female entrepreneurs in Kampala.  The live, interactive module detailed how to recognize and define areas of stress, and gave participants actionable strategies and resources to improve their own wellness, which would in turn increase their productivity and capability to handle the demands of their multiple roles in life.  As a result, the strategies we proposed would replace some of the negative coping mechanisms that were commonplace in Uganda, such as binge drinking, and improve health outcomes.",,,1,,1,0,3

The small car should have yielded but did not, moving too slowly. I shouted out in the split second before the headlights of one met the side of the other. The merged mass tore past the front of my car and came crashing into a ditch. After telling my brother to call 911, I found myself running toward the scene with a seatbelt cutter in one hand and a flashlight waving through the darkness in the other. A vehicle that once comfortably seated five now lay crumbled like an empty milk jug, barely fitting its singular passenger. That passenger, a middle-aged woman, lay on what used to be the roof, breathing heavily but otherwise unmoving.

At this point I had known for years I wanted to pursue medicine, but never before had I felt so desperate to have the proper knowledge for someone else’s sake. A physician could have assessed the physiological damage and improved the outcome. However, I felt helpless at the scene, not wanting to cause further damage by moving her. After telling a police officer what happened, there was nothing more I could do. I never found out what happened to the woman.

My initial interest in medicine came during my freshman year of high school. With a schizophrenic grandpa, it was by chance I was assigned to research the illness for a health class. I became engrossed, my digging far surpassing the necessities of the assignment. I learned of the illness’s ability to pull people toward drug use and alcoholism, the reason I had little relationship with my grandpa when I was young. I learned of antipsychotic medications increasing the chance of diabetes, something I had known him to suffer from for years. Connections were drawn left and right that I was previously oblivious to. Feeling as if the only thing I was missing was a magnifying glass and pipe, my research did not stop there. I drifted into studying other mental illnesses, how they are treated, and most importantly to my future, who treats them. Wanting to educate, diagnose, and prescribe for the sake of the grandpas and all others battling mental illness, I became fixated on psychiatry. Thus, I set my goal to become a physician.

This pursuit brought me to Purdue studying health sciences. When the pandemic hit my sophomore year, I watched as the death count climbed exponentially, many from nursing homes. Knowing many healthcare workers continued working despite risks, I felt inspired to contribute. I passed a nurse aide certification course and took a job at a nursing home near my rural hometown. In the worst of it, over half of the residents were quarantined. Plastic drapes blocked off hallway entrances. Employees wore yellow clothing covers, masks, and face shields, not daring to expose skin. Loved ones were separated, only safe to touch hands across the glass of a window. Residents had no outside support, relying only on my coworkers and me for daily needs. While they were entirely dependent on us, we were entirely dependent on physicians’ treatment instructions. I felt honored to care for the residents during this isolating time, but in my position, there was only so much I could do. Being the one to deliver those instructions was what I truly wanted. 

J was one of my residents that suffered permanent damage to his brain after a stroke. Even in the worst of times, he would smile beneath his white bushy mustache. Although he struggled to verbalize sentences, J was a talented writer. Knowing I would have to stay late charting, I still felt honored reading from his book of life stories to him before bed. I read about his childhood friend who died at a young age and his father whom he embarrassed at a fancy restaurant. All of his stories ended with a reflection upon life and its beauty. The connection I had with J is one I hope to have with many of my future patients.

Once the practice’s COVID restrictions permitted, I had the privilege of shadowing Dr. B, a family physician in rural Indiana. I witnessed him meet with 53 patients, many at their time of desperate need. I stood in a small, white room as a recovering alcoholic broke down, asking for help maintaining sobriety. Another woman going through divorce, seeking help sleeping, unable to get more than four hours a night. I was struck by Dr. B’s ability to wholeheartedly listen. He sat on his sliding stool nodding, asking questions in the pauses, and crafting his solution to the problem at hand. There was genuine gratitude from the patients, one woman cupping her hands around his saying “God bless you”. He brought hope. I strive to provide the same hope to the community I will one day serve.

These opportunities have confirmed my initial decision to become a doctor. I have sought out ways to improve my skills and perspective, to better myself as a future physician while aiding others. But although rewarding, these experiences are building to something bigger. At the end of the day, I am still left wanting to do more. I am still left wanting to take on further responsibility for my patients, to continue to form meaningful relationships but also to heal people and to bring hope. In my mind, there is only one career choice that encompasses all of these roles and it’s the one for me.","After completing addiction rehab, my uncle lived with us. During this time, I learned a lot about a world I had only seen from the periphery. I saw the difficulty in adapting to an entirely new lifestyle and cutting out friends and family who used drugs. Even at his job as a roofer where I accompanied him one day, I saw his co-workers disappear periodically to use meth. I witnessed him rejecting their offers to join. He and I talked about his daily motivation to stay clean and get his kids back from foster care. As a kid, I had lost contact with family due to their addictions but didn‚Äôt see their day-to-day struggles. Living with my uncle during this time taught me that growing up in an environment with drugs is very difficult to escape. Some, like my mom, do. Many others do not. Previously, I had the belief that all drug abusers were to blame for their predicaments. While each individual can choose to do drugs or not, some people are set up socially and genetically to become addicts.","During the first wave of the pandemic, I took a CNA certification class and began working at a nursing home. Because of strong restrictions, the residents were unable to have visitors and because so, many suffered from severe loneliness. For some, this brought the anxiety of being alone, for others, depression. I did all I could to bring comfort to the residents at the time, but when I resumed my position in the community service committee of Timmy Global Health the following school year, I wanted to do more for the mental health of local nursing homes. I started what was known as the ‚ÄòSending Love Campaign‚Äô in which Timmy members regularly wrote cards and drew pictures to encourage and uplift local seniors. According to my contacts, the residents loved it. Not only did this bring positivity into the lives of many secluded individuals, it also provided members and myself a fun way to continue serving the community in a COVID-safe manner.",,,1,"Because of COVID-19, there‚Äôs been a greater need in nursing homes and hospitals. While the pandemic has been a terrible thing, it has provided me with more contribution opportunities. These opportunities have given me first-hand experience in caring for patients and overall helped confirm my career path. Also, I took virus and immunology courses during the pandemic, providing a deeper understanding, and allowing me to discuss options with patients skeptical of the vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic did delay my ability to shadow physicians, however, and made community service trickier. Also, as someone who thrives on social interaction, I had a difficult time with online classes and didn‚Äôt perform as well those semesters. Fortunately, with my position in the hospital, I still had some exposure to physician care, and I was able to find creative ways to contribute to the community without putting anyone in danger.",1,1,1
2023,15441469,,24,Man,USA,1,EO2,0,0,,U,0,1,"In October of my freshman fall semester, I was asked to meet with Student Conduct about an alcohol infraction. My roommate had recently called an RA to my aid one Saturday night because I went out and drank more than I should've. As a first-year new to campus, there was much stress in my world. I was acclimating to intense academic rigor and a heavy athletic training schedule. After receiving my first ever C on a college exam, I went into the weekend with a lot of emotions. I later took responsibility for my actions. Stress is no excuse to drink recklessly. My conduct counselor advised me to explain the situation to my family and behave smarter in the future. Nothing of the sort ever happened again. 

In the spring semester of my senior year, I was asked to meet with Student Conduct about a community standard violation. A few weeks prior, I attended a boxing class with friends. In minding the community standard, we all wore masks and put together a group of 10, which was the maximum number that Duke allowed to gather. However, after the class, the group took a picture to capture the moment. Because the boxing instructor and the receptionist hopped into the photo, our group jumped to 12. The violation was excused, but I held myself accountable and recognize the importance of health guidelines.",0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,5477,90.0,412.0,2350.0,,55.0,1,2762,1,467,03/12/2022,Duke University,Evolutionary Anthropology,0,,No,No,No,"$125,000 - 149,999",6,1,0,0,15.0,60.0,5.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,15,Exceptional,4,2023,3,5.0,0.5,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,"Beneath the fluorescent lights of a consultation room, I stood beside an orthopedic surgeon, wearing my favorite blue button-down and feeling an extreme sense of déjà vu. About a year prior, I had been in a nearly identical room with this surgeon, discussing my torn ACL. Except for this time, the ligament of concern was not my own, and instead of my two parents accompanying us, there was another high school boy and his parents. I discerned in the boy’s face all the same emotions I felt when I was in his position: frustration, pain, and defeat. I wished I could fix his knee at that moment myself because I knew exactly how badly he wanted to compete again. Fortunately, the surgeon was receptive to the young athlete’s emotions, just as he was to mine, and I once again got to witness his stellar approach to treating an injury. I observed how he thoroughly explained all aspects of the recommended surgery and kept the patient’s family at ease by directly responding to any questions asked. At one point, the surgeon asked me to confirm the importance of post-op physical therapy. Excited to contribute, I nervously explained how therapy was integral to my full recovery. That consultation demonstrated to me that treating a patient should not solely entail physiological healing, but should also involve nurturing their sense of confidence in the recovery process. This surgeon, who expertly reconstructed my ACL and so kindly allowed me to shadow him, accomplished this by incorporating empathy into his practice. Witnessing this integrated approach, as both a patient and a student, further inspired me to pursue a career in which I could spend my life holistically improving the lives of others through medicine. 

Shadowing my surgeon also left me with a greater sense of the power of mentorship. I’ve been fortunate to have had several other mentors in my life who’ve similarly motivated me towards positive growth. I developed a successful career in track and field after watching my older sister excel in the sport. I ultimately chose my college major after an introduction by a fantastic professor who charismatically shared his passion for the field. And I’ve grown great pride in my identity as a gay man with the guidance of an older cousin who showed me how to be resilient and follow my dreams unapologetically. So much of my character has been shaped by those who have altruistically shared their knowledge and experiences to guide and empower me. Following the examples of my various mentors, I’ve committed myself to build a life around serving others. 

I was granted the opportunity to put this commitment into practice the summer before my junior year of college. I traveled to Zhuhai, a rural province in China, to create an enriching, immersive linguistic experience for my students. I was intensely motivated to make a difference but quickly learned that this service would challenge me in several ways. I often found myself standing before a sea of energetic middle schoolers, attempting to break through an intimidating cacophony and begin the opening activity of my planned English lesson. I had to learn to adapt to the incredible heat, the pair of boys whose attention I couldn’t keep, and the language barrier that prevented me from communicating with much of the community around me. However, none of these factors kept me from showing up for my students each day. Thinking back to what I learned during my shadowing experience, I pursued a holistic approach to teaching. If I wanted to positively impact the lives and learning experience of my students, I knew I had to put in the effort to better understand them on a personal and cultural level. This meant meeting groups of students during lunch and playing innumerable rounds of requested pickup basketball games after school. Putting my role as their teacher aside allowed me to connect much better with the students. My driving force throughout those rewarding two months, as it always has been and is to this day, was to make a positive impact on the community that would outlive my stay. I expect that these lessons will help me navigate the challenges associated with a career as a physician.

Continuing my interest in mentorship, I currently spend five days a week encouraging high schoolers to go after their goals. I make a special effort to lift up my black and queer students experiencing similar challenges that I was at their age —having a fear of fully expressing one’s identity or feeling like certain paths are not designed for people who look like you, for example. Watching the students I advise receive acceptance to various colleges despite all the challenges in their lives is extremely fulfilling. This reminds me to give credit to my twelfth-grade self who committed to attending college and becoming a doctor because he loved what science revealed to him about the world, he loved learning about how the human body works, and he loved helping people. I am excited to continue my trajectory toward my dreams and develop a foundation of knowledge that will allow me to make a difference in many lives. I aspire to be a physician who not only makes diagnoses and prescribes treatments, but also inspires, empowers, and supports his patients.","My time participating in a service program in China was challenging, as I was the only black person in most spaces I entered. I often felt uneasy, lonely, and frustrated. My blackness was fetishized, as people shoved cameras in my face, asked about my athletic abilities, and referred to me in terms of my race. I chose to learn from my encounters with prejudice and soon found that many of the actions were not out of malice but out of excitement or curiosity. I was simply a novelty to the community._x000D_
 _x000D_
This experience taught me that I could choose how I perceive situations. That doesn't mean I excused the behavior. However, because I worked to distinguish between mere ignorance and overt racism, I could operate with less strain on my heart and continue to serve my community with both empathy and respect. As a future physician, I'll likely encounter patients who disagree with my sexuality or doubt my abilities as a black man. Though, experiences like this equip me to respond effectively. ","Serving for AmeriCorps in Durham this past year allowed me to directly counteract some of the educational disadvantages that many youths in the area face. For example, I assisted students in finding funding for college who otherwise would've had to take out an insurmountable amount of loans or not attend school at all. I also worked with many parents who sought my support because they did not attend college and couldn't guide their children through the process. I felt like I was leveling the playing field and using my privilege as a college graduate to create educational opportunities for a community of students that started out with barriers most of my previous classmates never worried about. This idea of breaking barriers is very much why I am pursuing medicine. I do not only wish to use my practice to extend quality healthcare to the medically underserved, but I'd also like to encourage bright young people who feel the path to medicine was not made for them to follow their dreams.",,,1,"The pandemic has taught me much about myself and the world around me. COVID-19 has accentuated many of the shortcomings of our administration and current policy. I've directly observed minority communities being disproportionately affected by the pandemic, healthcare workers battling the heavy burden of inadequate covid responses within their communities, and low-income schools persistently attempting to offer quality education with extremely limited resources. Contributing to initiatives dedicated to correcting the injustices of a flawed system in various capacities has been very fulfilling. However, there is a lot I still have to learn about how the world operates and why so many disparities still exist today. I'm confident I'll leave this pandemic a much more informed and determined student, citizen, and professional. While I've effected some change thus far, I aspire to use my medical education to improve healthcare in communities underserved by a system that vows to protect them.",1,0,3

My mom had taken all her pills in a suicide attempt. She was lucky to be alive. As someone who grew up without so much as a broken bone, this is my strongest and most influential encounter with medicine. In the following weeks, the days bled into each other as I balanced school, scheduling appointments, and translating for my mom. However, I clearly remember the moment my mom’s doctor sat down and asked how I was doing. Despite the dark circles under his eyes revealing his own exhaustion, he listened attentively as I shared my favorite stories of my mom. This conversation was the first time I saw her viewed as a mother, a wife, and a human being more than her illness. I walked away from this experience both shocked at how close her life was to ending and awed by the physicians who allowed her to keep writing her story. Having experienced firsthand the impact stories can have on patients and their families, I want to pass on the compassion shown to me in a time of need.

In college, driven by an urge to better understand the role that narratives play in medicine, I began interviewing physicians and patients for the Global Women’s Narrative Project, a non-profit that uses women's stories to promote policy change. One interviewee was ""Linda"", an uninsured patient whose reluctance to go to the ER led to a wound turning septic. As she showed me the scar on her arm, her frustration was clear. Through trauma-informed interview training, I learned how to remain sensitive and empathetic, and gently reminded her to take breaks. Listening to recounts of system failures and an inability to access affordable medical care has allowed me to reflect on how I can better advocate for low-income patients. Weeks later, I received a card from ""Linda"", who wrote that recounting her story has been instrumental to her healing. Working with women like her has taught me that system-level changes are needed to ensure that financially disadvantaged patients have access to equitable healthcare. I am indebted to each woman for their vulnerability, as this experience has helped me realize both the healing power of stories and my desire to work with disadvantaged populations.

Moved by this realization, I began incorporating storytelling into clinical practice as a Medical Assistant in Dr. Henry Tsai’s OBGYN clinic. Located in Monterey Park, the mostly working-class Chinese and Hispanic/Latinx patients often bring an unwanted companion to their appointments—anxiety. In addition to their symptoms, these immigrant women are also burdened with worrying if their physician will understand their language and culture. One memorable patient was ""Ms. Li"", a pregnant woman who experienced bleeding in her final trimester. When I noticed her fingers nervously twirling her hair, I tried to ease her worries in the same way that my mom’s physician did for me, by asking her to share stories. When she realized that I spoke Mandarin, her relief was palpable and she began chattering excitedly about Yin Er Soup, a traditional Chinese dessert for expectant moms. Watching her fingers still, I was filled with satisfaction knowing that I could also practice compassionate care by incorporating stories into medicine. By the end of her visit, I discovered that this petite Asian woman has an enormous belly laugh and is strongly opinionated on baby names (One should never name a baby after a celebrity.) Working with predominantly non-English speaking patients like ""Ms. Li"" has helped me realize the need for cultural competency and compassionate care that addresses not only the illness but the person behind it. This experience has further solidified my belief that stories can serve as a tool to bridge language and cultural barriers to build meaningful relationships with patients of all backgrounds. To play a small role in ""Ms. Li's"" care has been a unique privilege. As I watched her walk out the clinic, I realized that medicine alone offers an opportunity to care for the entirety of a person by addressing both their bodily symptoms and their emotional needs.

In many ways, my patients’ love of stories reminds me of my mom. Every year on my birthday, she tells the story of how I got my nickname “DaYu”, meaning downpour in Mandarin. “There was a drought for all of July. When you were born, the skies celebrated with me.” After hearing the same story for 20 years, I often shake my head as she repeats it. My patients finally helped me understand the power of this story—a story of joy and life. In moments of illness and pain, my patients and my mom turn to their stories for strength. They remind themselves that they are mothers, daughters, and human beings who cannot be reduced to their symptoms. My job as a future physician is to listen to these stories to not only connect with my patients but to heal them. I aspire to use each story to tailor treatment plans to a patient’s unique goals in life. My patients and my mom teach me about the healing power that stories can hold, and I know that I will use my future career as a physician to help them write more stories.","Lorena and I are nothing alike. She likes iced tea and hates my ripped jeans. I choose coffee over tea and love my jeans. Most importantly, we have a 60 year age difference. _x000D_
I met Lorena volunteering at her nursing home pre-pandemic, where I quickly realized that we were shockingly similar. Sharing an unhealthy sweet tooth, we exchanged cake recipes. Most importantly, both of us knew what it meant to miss someone. During COVID, Lorena‚Äôs family stopped visiting her. Despite her insistence that it was safer this way, she often looked longingly at a picture of her grandchildren. Similarly, I became isolated from my parents when they quarantined in Beijing. _x000D_
 _x000D_
Lorena and I might never agree on my jeans, but we can agree on the importance of staying connected to our loved ones, which is why I helped set up her Zoom account. Likewise, by emphasizing shared goals with my future patients, I can build meaningful relationships with those that have different cultural beliefs than me.","When two lines appeared on her pregnancy test, ‚ÄúLina‚Äù excitedly scheduled her first OB appointment. However, at her appointment, the receptionist told her she needed to learn better English. She left without a follow-up appointment, delaying care._x000D_
_x000D_
I heard Lina‚Äôs story when she transferred her care to Dr. Tsai‚Äôs office, where I work as a medical assistant. Although my powers were limited, I could answer her questions in Mandarin, her preferred language, which eased her anxiety. Motivated by this encounter, I also helped to make a bilingual sheet of common medical terms and phrases so that patients can communicate easier with their providers. _x000D_
_x000D_
As a future physician, this experience has taught that healthcare access exists in a complex world of socio-cultural factors. I‚Äôm interested in using stories like ‚ÄúLina‚Äôs‚Äù to improve the experiences immigrant patients have in seeking care. At Rush, I hope to share their stories through Habitus, the health humanities journal._x000D_

One interviewee is a doctor quarantining away from her son, who said the term made her angry.

These health inequities strain the healthcare system and necessitate the sacrifices of healthcare workers._x000D_

Mr. W settled in quickly, and his slicked back hair, memorable voice, and outgoing personality make him stand out. Meeting me in the treatment room following his shower, I proceed to help him with his footcare. He is excited in anticipation of the neck surgery we have scheduled him for, the next day, at a nearby hospital - surgery that will hopefully improve his mobility and quality of life. 
     Christ House is oddly quiet the next day while Mr. W undergoes his surgery. That afternoon, the nurses learn that although surgery went well, he will require a few days at the hospital to recover. It was with surprise, that we received a phone call from a local shelter just one day later, telling us that Mr. W. had been discharged, but instead of making it back to Christ House, he was staying at a tent encampment, and he was in bad shape. I drive to the encampment, longing to hear Mr. W’s cheerful voice and see his slicked back hair, yet that is far from the scene that I come upon. Instead, I barely recognize him: his hair is a cloud above his head, he wears disposable clothes, he is dirty, his voice is scratchy, and he is struggling to move. As we drive back to Christ House, and in the hours and days that follow, I am confused, frustrated, and disheartened. How could Mr. W. have been discharged to the street? Why did this happen? Will he be okay? Did his time unhoused impact his healing? What about others like him who cannot come to Christ House?
     My days at Christ House were rewarding but each day came with its own challenges from barriers related to health insurance, the unpredictable nature of addiction recovery, and the ever-changing demands of the pandemic. Working with an inspired group of healthcare professionals showed me the ways that true passion and caring attention can impact patient well-being. Their indomitable desire to help patients make progress in their lives was inspiring and gave me a deeper appreciation for the healing process. I have witnessed patients make incredible strides going from crutches to walking unaided or having a completely open wound heal to a nearly invisible scar.   
     I have come to better recognize the connection between public health and quality healthcare through my summer research at the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center and by interning with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As I arrived in the Bacteriology Laboratory, the technology and the impressive scientists mesmerized me. In a short time, after settling in, I was directed to work on a project seeking to understand an outbreak of antibiotic resistant bacteria that occurred at a medical facility in the Northeast. Epidemiologists and public health scientists are often referred to as disease detectives and this is indeed the role I assumed. I was given forty-four samples to examine. Although, at first, the samples appeared unrelated, through mass spectroscopy, polymerase chain reaction, and whole genome sequencing, the data became clues that pointed to the possibility of relatedness among the samples. Along with a biostatistician, I utilized this data to create a map to trace the movement of the outbreak through the facility. Organizing my data and presenting my findings to the stakeholders of the facility enabled them to develop policies and procedures to address future infection control. This research created a connection in my mind between the direct treatment of patients and the public health measures that mediate illnesses. A desire to continue learning about public health led me to the CDC where I worked with an education program to provide teachers the opportunity to learn about ways to implement public health into their classroom curriculum. During the height of the pandemic, I worked with public health specialists to develop educational resources on COVID-19. We formulated activities and lessons that were hands-on, question-evoking, and fun. The activities allowed the young students to take on the role of disease detectives and better understand the importance of public health in keeping themselves and their communities safe and healthy.
     My public health research and my volunteer experience at Christ House have shaped my plans for my future career and have confirmed my interest in entering the public health field. While I continue to grapple with the challenging systemic questions I faced when I left the tent encampment with Mr. W., I witnessed how Mr. W., slowly, but surely, got back to his normal self when situated back in a supportive environment. His hair once again was slicked back and his voice once again carried through the hallways. Mr. W was healed in time to perform in the Christ House talent show and as I listened to him sing “watching the tide roll away, ohh . . .”, a smile beamed under my mask. It was the first time I fully understood the saying “it is music to my ears”. I have seen first-hand how patience, resilience, and problem solving in the face of challenge can foster healing and I hope to be a part of that process as a physician.","As an undergraduate student, I was drawn to a range of opportunities to build relationships with others in communities different from mine. Through experiences working in rural Appalachia, a fishing village in South Caicos, communities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Jacksonville and Boston, and volunteering in Worcester, New York‚Äôs Capital Region, and Washington, DC, I witnessed the inequities communities face surrounding food insecurity, healthcare access, housing issues, and racial injustice. Connecting with these community members deepened my passion for serving those whose voices are often unheard. Through listening to the stories of those who are different from you, I learned that when you dismantle unconscious biases, you can become more compassionate and understanding of differences. These experiences helped me see how health disparities impact medical care and prepared me to advocate for underserved patient populations.","My experience at Christ House, a clinic for men experiencing homelessness, showed me the impact that compassionate, holistic healthcare has on healing. Before working at Christ House, I thought that healing started and ended in the treatment room and never really considered the role feeling safe and supported played in the healing process. However, working with this patient population showed me that the healing process involves more than just treating ailments. Many patients arrived at Christ House quiet and guarded. Through sharing stories, being encouraging, and showing respect, I saw the patients became more comfortable and talkative. As I built relationships with this diverse community, I recognized how my presence had a noticeable impact on the patients‚Äô well-being and, in turn, on their healing. Providing a warm and caring environment, lifted their spirits, allowed the patients to focus on their healing, and led to positive health outcomes.",,,1,"Due to the impact of COVID delays on MCAT scheduling, I had to schedule my test for September in Washington DC. In the span of three months, I graduated from college, moved from Massachusetts home to New York, then to an intentional living community in Washington, DC where I acclimated to a new area, started a new job serving an underserved population, and prepared for the MCAT. The job was rewarding yet draining. I underestimated the impact the work had on my MCAT preparation. As such, my performance on the MCAT is not representative of my potential for success in medical school. I am a conscientious and dedicated student who is excited to learn. In addition to graduating in the top 5 percent in high school, my four-year academic record at Holy Cross demonstrates my consistently strong academic record and is more indicative of my future success. I am academically prepared for the rigorous medical school curriculum, ready to dedicate myself to my medical studies, and excited to continue to serve others.",1,0,2

As I began walking away, the woman in the passenger seat called out for me to wait. Her voice on edge, she asked me “is this going to hurt?” I took a deep breath, walked over, and explained the process for her COVID test – “there might be discomfort, but there shouldn’t be pain.” I walked back to registration, labeled the vials for their swabs, and headed back to the car. Channeling my inner soccer coach, we counted loudly together as each family member swabbed their nostrils. I thanked them for coming to get tested, they drove away, and I moved on to the next car. 

I began working at COVID testing sites four days after my virtual MPH graduation, eager to be involved after weeks of reading news about overflowing hospitals and broken supply chains. Managing a mobile COVID testing team in Atlanta fell within my abilities as a seasoned program coordinator and newly minted MPH, but my capacity to provide medical care ended with the receipt of their test results. This experience strengthened a decision I had made during my MPH program to pursue medical school and expand my capacity to provide care.

My path to medicine has not been linear. As a pre-med Theology major, I studied a wide range of topics, from morality and religious ethics to resonance structures and enzyme kinetics. While I had completed my pre-requisites for medical school upon graduation, my experience working with young people in the juvenile justice system led me to work in school-based programming for underserved youth after college. Over my two years working with hundreds of elementary and middle school students, I had time to appreciate the multifaceted nature of each child’s life, and how their physical and socio-emotional health was influenced by these varied factors. To deepen my knowledge of how health could be viewed through an intersectional lens, I pursued my MPH. 

For my MPH thesis project, I worked with urban gardeners to mitigate harm from elevated soil lead (Pb). This experience fueled my desire to become a physician. Over hours of conversation with neighborhood residents, I realized the interdependence of individual clinical intervention and community-level intervention. The health of the community relied at once upon the prevention of exposure and effective diagnosis and treatment for those already exposed. While a physician’s expertise is especially useful for treatment plans, when paired with a trusting relationship, that expertise is also crucial for prevention. As science communicators and practitioners, physicians are positioned to bridge the gap between knowledge and action. As a public health researcher alone, I was unable to offer more insight into the impact of lead on child development or initiate the next steps of a full health evaluation. As a physician with a public health background, I hope to integrate deep knowledge of the human body with a broad understanding of social determinants of health to compose a full picture of each patient. 

While shadowing primary care physicians, I have seen the importance of having the full picture. Unresolved finger pain affected one patient’s ability to work her cleaning job, which in turn affected her diabetes management. Another patient came in for an inhaler refill, but also wanted to discuss his mental health and recent opioid overdose. The intimacy and comprehensive nature of these topics feels similar to the phone surveys that I currently conduct as a Clinical Research Coordinator. With each phone survey, I am offered a window into the life of a young person who is incarcerated. I am humbled by their honesty when I ask deeply personal questions about substance misuse, sexual history, and their mental health. It is in these moments when I again long for a role that would allow me to offer more. While shadowing, I witnessed similar difficult questions and vulnerable answers, but with the added element of a co-created plan to address the identified areas of need. As a physician, I hope to continue these one-on-one interactions with an added layer of biopsychosocial knowledge to facilitate improved health.

As the daughter of two physicians, I grew up a witness to tremendous acts of service and care. I saw the comfort my parents brought to situations of distress, whether they were performing CPR at a wedding or having lengthy phone calls with family friends about a new diagnosis. I am drawn to medicine out of a desire to provide that same comfort and counsel to people about their health. While my childhood environment first sparked my interest, my specific motivations for choosing to become a physician have been shaped by a decade of my own personal discernment working within systems of incarceration, education, health, and the intersections between them all. As a second-generation Chinese Mexican American woman, I have lived at a cultural intersection my whole life. As a physician with experience working across systems, I intend and hope to continue working in an interdisciplinary way. I believe that here at the intersections lies the greatest potential for impact.","An experience that enhanced my ability to interact with those unlike myself happened during my month-long stay at a language school in Mexico. As a Mexican-American, I felt at home in Mexico. However, all 10 of my classmates at the language school were White Catholic priests from the diocese of Little Rock, Arkansas. In our first week, we established our opposition on nearly every issue from abortion, to gay marriage, to Columbus Day. As time passed, I was able to make a connection with two of the priests, inviting them to play soccer. We eventually found common ground in our belief that religion could serve as a powerful organizing force, as was the case in the Catholic Worker Movement. Nurturing the common ground between us reminded me that there is diversity even among those who check the same demographic box. As I interact with people unlike myself, I am mindful to remember that while cultural context is an important starting point, it does not fully tell you who people are. ","I have impacted my community through my food security efforts at the school-based health center. During my first week at the school, several parents asked for food resources during their student‚Äôs appointment. Collaborating with the nurse practitioner and principal I was able to see how our health center could address this need. I reached out to the local food bank and farms and arranged for a weekly pick-up of both pantry goods and fresh produce. I asked the school counselor for advice on which families may benefit, and she provided me with a list of families who had asked about food assistance in the past. In addition to distributing food to these specific families, I also set up free produce stands for all students once a week. I am grateful that the food program has created strong relationships with school staff, students, and families alike. I am looking forward to developing further relationships with families on the West Side through the abundance of opportunities through RCSIP.",,,1,"The pandemic influenced my decision to pursue medicine and the work opportunities available to me after MPH graduation. With my background in coordination and public health, I worked as a site manager for a mobile COVID-19 testing site. In my experience, the main barriers to testing were limited mobility and distrust. Witnessing these barriers become more pronounced throughout the pandemic furthered my interest in examining and addressing health disparities._x000D_
_x000D_
The pandemic also illustrated the power of community and connection. I volunteered with the mutual aid project Free99Fridge, which pooled community resources to provide free, quality food at locations across the city. Working with Free99 entrenched the idea that the fulfillment of basic needs such as food, water, shelter, and community are the foundation of all health. These lessons have shaped my mindset as I have prepared my application to medical school.",1,0,2

I was supposed to be enjoying my birthday at Legoland but found myself being operated on by a surgeon. I woke up with a large cast around my arm as the surgeon calmed my mother, providing her with his private phone number to contact him about my health in the future. Eventually, my pediatrician took out two giant metal rods from my arm and removed my cast. I sat there dumbfounded, moving the arm I thought I would never use again, thinking, “My body healed itself!” As time went on this interest in the human body remained. Upon my arrival at UCSB, I took the opportunity to explore courses that would allow me to learn more about our body’s beauty and flaws. Moreover, through my experiences outside of the classroom, I would come to learn the significance of compassion and leadership, leading me to pursue medical school.

I realized that I could only learn so much about the human body through a textbook and began working as a research assistant for the Pruitt Lab under the supervision of Dr. Blair, which involved studying the impact of cancer drugs on hiPSC-CM’s contractility. It was a surreal experience seeing our inquisition come to life through many hours spent culturing and imaging. During my time imaging, Dr. Blair discussed how he worked as a CNA while considering a career in medicine and how transformative it was for him. 

Following in his footsteps, I took up a job as a caregiver, which I originally saw as an opportunity to learn more about the human body. As I arrived at the retirement community and greeted the nurses, I began to worry that I was not ready to handle the stresses of caring for people in such a critical part of their lives as I saw how hard the medical personnel worked with the families to provide a comfortable life for those staying there. I’ll never forget one resident who was a retired urologist that immediately greeted me on my first day. During our evening walks, we discussed both of our lives and he told me about his arduous, fulfilling career in medicine. As weeks went by, I would come to his home and show him things I learned in my research lab or classes and my positive energy would brighten up his day. It became clear how providing help for something as simple as taking off one’s shoes could have such a positive impact on others. He was always thankful for the help I gave, but as time went by he began to get weaker. One day I came to his home ready to show him a shift in my research results, but I found him bedridden and learned that he had fallen a day earlier. I began to see firsthand how cruel and fast aging can be and the importance of building a relationship with someone over time. Just easing his mood, listening to him, and doing simple tasks would have a large impact on his health. I learned the power a relationship could have on one’s health and the fulfillment I had felt being there for him. I only wish I could have had more of an impact on his health and decided to explore the field of medicine that he informed me much about.

Learning about these fields, I found myself torn between which healthcare career I wanted to pursue. I decided to co-found a pre-health organization with my classmates to engage more with students and learn more about these fields. As the president of an organization, I quickly discovered the workload associated with being in charge of others. Initially, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the responsibilities but learned that listening to others and guiding my team made the work easier. Over time, I began to appreciate having the extra workload and the privileges that come with being the leader of the team as it is an opportunity to create impactful events and help those around me to a greater extent.

Furthering my medical curiosity, I found myself working in the Cottage Hospital ER. Working directly with the doctors, I saw all my experiences connect with the physician's skills. One night, I saw a young boy being hauled in by paramedics for an open fracture wound on his knee from a fall, a similar trauma that I endured many years ago. I saw him cry and understood his panic as he stared at his bleeding leg, but due to the physician's previously developed relationship with the family, they quickly approved of the patient’s images and labs. The surgeon discussed with the hesitant mother to give consent regarding the surgery and lead the healthcare team to get the patient into the OR. A few days later, I saw a healthy young boy in a cast laughing with his family and how grateful the family was for the physician’s work. I realized that the physician demonstrated a deep understanding of the human body, compassion by building relationships with his patients, the exciting discovery process, and leadership within the healthcare team. 

These are some of the most impactful experiences that I underwent over the past few years that I saw come together in the ER through the physician’s daily activities. After a few shifts, I decided that I will become a physician to bring together the experiences I’ve had and apply these lessons, so I can make the same change in one’s life as a surgeon did many years ago to a bewildered kid with a broken arm.","While volunteering at KCF, I would help families pack up their food and take their items to their cars. During these trips, I would talk to these families and understand what is going on in their lives. One day, a family explained that they had been worried about their daughter‚Äôs fever for several weeks and were grateful for some of our soups. When I asked why they didn‚Äôt take her to urgent care or the family doctor, they explained that ‚Äúthose people don‚Äôt care about us.‚Äù I began to see the mistrust people from low-income families have for physicians. As a scribe, my interactions with patients from underrepresented backgrounds reinforced what I learned while volunteering. Working in the ER, I encountered a Spanish-speaking patient who held her daughter close when the physician arrived, but the interpreter calmed her nerves and gained her trust quickly. I realized the importance of understanding other‚Äôs cultures as it provides insight into the person one is caring for.","Through my student organization, I worked to keep my peers informed on specific health topics and careers. In addition, I offer services for people to find their career paths while tearing down the toxic pre-health stereotypes by creating a host of events through teamwork. One of our more significant events was a lunch-in with local healthcare providers so that students could ask questions or gain experience with these professionals. During this event, one of our members appeared to have difficulty meeting with providers, so I made sure to let him have a direct conversation with a pediatrician. A few days later, he expressed gratitude as he began shadowing the pediatrician at his local clinic, but he found out that he didn‚Äôt want to pursue the pre-med track. Instead, he followed a PA that worked there and decided to pursue that career path. I was proud that I could help at least one person clear up their path and provide people with free resources to further their careers._x000D_
",,,1,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, I took all of my prerequisite courses online. Also, I could not begin training at my scribe job until the fall of 2022, even though I was hired early in the summer, limiting my time commitment. The pandemic has limited some of the possible activities I wanted to pursue, specifically clinical volunteering. Many of my prior volunteer commitments, such as Khalsa Care Foundation‚Äôs Hot Meals Initiative, kept me within the program. One of my main goals this past year was to become involved in clinical volunteering to help the underserved community through my passion for medicine. The pandemic forced a local organization named Doctor‚Äôs Without Walls to close its volunteering opportunity to new applicants during this time. This organization allows volunteers to help the local homeless or underserved communities by providing free forms of healthcare at differing locations in the Santa Barbara area.",1,0,1

When I was young, this comment was over my head, but years after my grandfather’s passing, this is a moment I think back upon fondly. My grandfather faced challenges as a young, Jewish man in the mid-1900s, including poverty and pervasive anti-Semitism. However, by working through school, taking out loans to be the first in his family to attend college, and studying diligently, he was able to gain access to medical school despite so-called “Jewish quotas” of the time. He was aware of the challenges I was facing in my own childhood; as an awkward kid with Tourette’s syndrome, I grew up in a fractured household and bounced between parents. My grandfather offered me valuable advice: “Find what you are truly passionate about, where you can make an impact, and in that you will find happiness.”
Acting on my grandfather’s recommendation, in my teens I played soccer and tennis, learned to code a game in Java, and joined student government. Although these experiences were engaging, I did not feel truly inspired by them. At the advice of my biology teacher, I inquired with my local hospital about volunteering. After a few weeks volunteering in the emergency department, I requested to shadow a physician and was paired with a general surgeon. He was performing an omental patch of the duodenum and the removal of multiple lipomas. I was in awe of the ease with which the surgeon navigated the human body, and with the precision and care he showed in every small movement of his hands. “Even though they are unconscious,” he said of his patients, “I treat them how I would like to be treated in their position. They are entrusting me with their life, and we must give them the care they deserve.” His ability to bring relief and health to so many people was truly inspiring to me. I value the compassion and commitment to others that this surgeon embodies.
 In college, I began to search for others that shared these same values, which is how I met Tommy at our school’s activity fair, when he approached me to return a pen that I left at his booth. Tommy and I struck up a conversation and quickly bonded over a shared love for, among many things, classic sci-fi shows. Later, Tommy attempted to take his own life, and I was devastated when I found out. I did not know at the time that he struggled with depression, and I was in shock, having spoken with him just hours earlier. I felt powerless, not knowing what I could have done to help. As Tommy’s condition improved, I realized I did not want to feel helpless again in a medical emergency. As a result, I volunteered on the Medical-Surgical unit of my local hospital, worked as a first responder at sporting events, and served as the medical staff for a sleep-away summer camp. 
I even earned my EMT certification and volunteered at my local ambulance corps in remote upstate New York. I often think about when I received a 9-1-1 call for Janet, an elderly woman who had a suspected pelvic fracture following a fall. She was frightened, not only from her injuries, but also because of our presence in her home at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. After I applied a splint and initiated transport, Janet grabbed my hand and said, “I’m scared.” I felt a connection with her, as she was sharing her vulnerability and anxiety with me in that moment, and I wanted to do everything possible to help her get better. While my interventions were important to her outcome, I was saddened that my involvement in Janet’s care ended at the doors of the hospital. I wanted to stick with her, to learn more about her background and history, and to provide more treatment needed for a complete recovery.
I believe that to adequately treat a patient first requires a deep understanding of health and illness. I enrolled in a medical sociology course, which fundamentally changed how I think about sickness as not just as a biological issue, but also as a social one. When a close friend of mine, Jenna, began to have headaches and dizziness and wanted to see a neurologist, I thought about the resources that she had. Did she come from a middle-class family? Did she have a strong support network? Access to a car? Health insurance? Yes. She had the means to travel over an hour to visit a neurologist, as there are few in our rural neighborhood. Others in this small town may not be so fortunate as Jenna, yet they still deserve to have access to care in their community.
As I continue to shadow virtually and observe the interactions between providers and patients, I envision myself as a physician who can use a deep understanding of a patient’s social identity as a framework for effective diagnosis and treatment. Further, I hope to provide these services to those in rural areas, to expand access to affordable, quality care. I am grateful to my grandfather for his advice to “find my passion,” and while I did not know it at the time, I am proud to share in his vision and his drive and pursue a career as a physician.","I was on a 9-1-1 call as an EMT for a patient with a hand laceration. We arrived to find out that the patient was a Spanish-speaking immigrant. With the use of a translator, I learned that he was scared to call for help because he was undocumented, and afraid that he would be deported. This was a new experience for me. Growing up as a white, male, documented U.S. citizen, I had been raised that I should always call 9-1-1 when I need help and to not fear the police or emergency services. This encounter taught me that when interacting with someone from a different background, it is important to try to consider the situation from their point of view. I also learned to confront my own privilege, as someone who has not had to deal with the fear of deportation like our patient. When dealing with future situations like this as a physician, I will be sensitive to each person‚Äôs unique background and nonjudgmental, while offering guidance and reassurance to provide quality, equitable care.","Learning about how social determinants of health, like race and sex, intersect to determine health outcomes made me aware of just how unequally people of different backgrounds experience healthcare. I believe firmly that a while a physician needs to have a strong grasp on the biological workings of the human body, they also must consider how each patient‚Äôs social factors may be influencing their overall health. During my Immigration and Migration course, I was a part of a research project which examined the access and utilization of reproductive healthcare services by Burman refugees in upstate New York. We found many factors, like sex, immigration status, and educational attainment all were associated with lower utilization of reproductive services. I made an impact on the community by sharing key steps in a poster session with physicians to improve equitable care, such as an awareness of the social determinants of health, and a willingness to engage in cultural competency training.",,,1,"I was originally accepted to a study program run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to take place during the summer and fall of 2020. I was set to be working in the lab of Dr. Carol Thiele, examining mechanisms of pediatric neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. I was disappointed to lose this unique research opportunity when the study program at the NIH was canceled due to the COVID-19 crisis. I am happy to say that I was able to find meaningful work that summer and returned to upstate New York and volunteered as an EMT. When the first round of vaccines became available, I also helped to administer vaccines to students and the local community. Helping provide medical care during a time of great need was a truly rewarding experience which reaffirmed my desire for a career as a physician.",1,0,2

The doctors explained that he could not move or speak but could feel everything, and I later learned this torturous condition is defined as locked-in syndrome. During hospital visits, I did my best to look after him. I was determined to live up to my father’s expectation that his children would care for him as he aged, a promise I had made to him years ago. But all I could do was offer him sips of water and patiently interpret his labored communication through the letter board. Remembering a man who was capable of lifting five times his body weight and getting a PhD in his second language, I initially thought he would recover. However, as the subsequent months dragged on, and I watched my father become a prisoner to his deteriorating body, I realized the severity of his condition. From this experience, I learned much about the prolonged, medicalized process we call dying–insurance obstacles, paperwork, hospital visits, the meaning of hospice, the heavy involvement of family. At 13, I was notified my father had become unresponsive; he died soon after, leaving me with an unsaid goodbye. 

Six years later, I was navigating quarantine as COVID cases rose when my grandfather came down with a “cold.” It quickly escalated to a severe case of COVID, and within a week, he was admitted to the hospital with no visitors allowed. Unable to see my grandfather’s decline, I figured he would easily pull through. But he soon requested to come home and be put on hospice. Reminded of the promise I had made to my father years ago, I tried to tend to my grandfather’s needs, offering sips of water and emptying his catheter bag. The morning he became unresponsive, I made sure to be by his side, caring for him in any way possible. The best I came up with was holding his hand, insisting he was not alone. 

The following summer, I worked as a CNA in a nursing home. Like my father and grandfather, many of the patients I cared for were declining or on hospice. While tending to my patients, I often caught myself thinking of these two men and what their deaths taught me: the importance of assisting those under my care to live with dignity in the final stages of their lives. In the nursing home, this form of support often consisted of simply holding their hand, an extra few minutes of conversation, or remembering their favorite treat for a nighttime snack. Working as a CNA, I discovered the need for healthcare professionals to be guides not just toward a healthier life but also in approaching a dignified death.
 
As my experiences brought me new perspectives of medicine, I began to seek further understanding of a physician’s role through shadowing. Due to COVID, I began my shadowing experience virtually, which provided ample scientific information but lacked the patient support I had encountered as a CNA. However, after shadowing OB/GYN physician Dr. Lyndsey Day in person, I observed how a physician can skillfully unite personal connection and medical knowledge. In OB/GYN, miscarriages are not uncommon, and my first patient observation with Dr. Day involved informing a young couple of their loss. As she guided the parents through the next medical steps needed for the mother’s health while also giving essential comfort, I witnessed the priceless role a physician plays in the management of death. This further validated my perspective of a physician as a guiding presence that cannot be emulated virtually. 

Through my experiences with my father, grandfather, and the uncertainty of the pandemic, I have come to discern that physicians act as a bridge between the intricate science of the body and the beautiful complexity of a person. A doctor provides patients with a supportive understanding of how human finitude can be managed with meaning and dignity, which includes caring for the whole patient: familial, spiritual, emotional, social, and physical needs. While the COVID pandemic has exposed the fragility of life, in light of my experiences it has also shown me what gives medicine meaning.","Last fall, I took a cadaver class while also in a Honors course about mortality. I was truly astonished by the makeup of the body. But discussing the dying process in different cultures and professions with my Honors peers, who range from engineering to art majors, I began to see the cadavers not just as educational vessels but also as people with a story who chose to become donors. While during practice stretching, my teammates, knowing I was in the cadaver class, would quiz me about the muscle names, which made me view the body in the context of athletes. As a future physician, I found it compelling to discuss these topics with teammates and future artists, engineers, etc., which has allowed me to connect with others in and out of my major or soccer team in meaningful conversation. Understanding the many perspectives of others, I will bring this ability to connect with fellow classmates at Rush and future patients, whether as a scientist, philosopher, athlete, or student.","As a Division I athlete, there is a lot expected of you from the first day you report as a freshman. During my junior year, Dana, a freshman, was not traveling and breaking team rules. Some upperclassmen were very upset, gossiping about Dana‚Äôs poor decisions and worrying about the punishment the team would receive because of her actions. However, after practice, I pulled her aside and asked if she wanted to stay and do extra sprint work. Giving her tips and encouragement, I could feel her become more comfortable, opening up to me about personal issues she was dealing with. Knowing this, I continued to encourage and support her at practices and when I saw her on campus. Dana earned a traveling spot, playing time, and even a starting position! Soon, Dana was earning conference awards and becoming a top goal scorer on our team. If I had not supported Dana, she may have never felt welcomed, creating a very different season for her and our team.",,,1,"With COVID precautions, my ability to gain physician shadowing and volunteering experience was greatly affected due to clinics and hospitals being shut off to student observation and volunteering positions. With these obstacles, I sought to supplement through virtual shadowing and becoming certified as a CNA. Additionally, in order for my collegiate soccer team to play and practice, athletes were required to limit any contact with those not in our team ‚Äúbubble,‚Äù not even being allowed to give family who attended games a hug. On top of campus restrictions, I was further limited in my ability to participate in other activities.

She suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm while at work that morning and was taken to the emergency room. She was airlifted to a second hospital for surgery and as I watched the helicopter take her away, I wondered if she would make it through the day.  

Emergency coiling surgery saved her life. She was put into a medically induced coma for three weeks to aid her recovery. I visited her every day and reassured her that I was still working hard on my schoolwork, swimming, and jazz band. The months that my mother was in the hospital were the hardest of my life, but this experience reaffirmed my dedication to a career in medicine. I appreciated the power of modern medicine that saved my mother’s life and experienced the difference a compassionate care team made in the lives of my mother and our family. This experience has taught me about the kind of physician I want to be and the importance of treating the whole patient. 

I have also learned about the kind of physician I want to be from my parents. My father is an emergency room physician, and my mother is a family practice physician. I have seen them deliver culturally and linguistically competent health care to their Latinx and Spanish speaking patients, which has led to my passion for health equity. I explored this passion through volunteer work at several community clinics including the Westminster Free Clinic in Thousand Oaks, California. This clinic serves a predominately Spanish-speaking and uninsured community and I worked there at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to become more involved in the clinic, so I completed their scribe training program. 

Scribing at the Free Clinic allowed me to work with physicians, translators, and other volunteers to provide patient care. I watched many non-English speaking patients struggle to communicate with their physician if a translator was not available and knew that something needed to be done to make language concordant care more available. I described the need for Spanish speaking physicians and more translators at the clinic to my mother and she began to volunteer. I scribed for my mother and saw the difference it made to patients to feel heard and cared for in their preferred language.  I saw how happy and comfortable patients felt and noticed that they were willing to share more information too. Providing linguistically and culturally concordant care created trust between my mother and her patients and seeing this impact firsthand furthered my commitment to becoming a physician that can provide that kind of care in the future. 

My commitment to health equity and diversity is also seen in my involvement in Stanford’s Comunidad for Health Equity (CHE) student group. I have been a member since my freshman year and have been on the leadership board for the past three years. Finding this community has been such a blessing because I have made friends with close backgrounds and similar goals of serving the underserved. CHE has also connected me to pre-medical activities like attending and volunteering at the Stanford University Minority Medical Alliance (SUMMA) conference, exposing me to what life as a medical student is going to be like. 

As a medical student, I would like to continue to be involved in research. At Stanford, I have been a research assistant in the Heller Lab for three years. I studied circadian rhythms and cognition using a Siberian hamster animal model. We used this animal model because it mimics the breakdown of circadian rhythms in humans and allowed us to examine the degeneration or improvement of cognition. For my honors thesis, I tested the effect of donepezil, an Alzheimer’s disease drug, on these arrhythmic hamsters. The goal of this research was to find pharmacotherapies that may improve learning and memory in individuals suffering from mild cognitive impairment due to circadian dysfunction. This work is especially important to me as my family has a history of Alzheimer’s disease and a history of shift work that can affect the circadian system. Pursuing research gave me an appreciation for the work that goes into developing medical therapies and has given me a valuable set of skills. I plan to continue to do research in medical school as it is an important part of advancing our medical knowledge and finding better ways to care for our patients. 

In June of 2022 I will graduate from Stanford University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology, with honors in recognition of my circadian rhythm research. After graduation, I will spend my first month of summer as a coach for Stanford University’s summer swim camp and will continue to volunteer as a medical scribe afterwards. Thank you for your time and consideration.","Volunteering at a free clinic has broadened my own view and enhanced my ability to understand others because I work with a diverse patient population. Our patients are disproportionately affected by high cost of living, access to health care, and burden of disease. One of the patient populations most affected by COVID-19 at my clinic were uninsured, Latinx day laborers and farmer workers. They rely on short term jobs in the farming and food industry and were not able to work from home during any part of the pandemic, putting them at an increased risk of getting the virus. The Latinx community also had disproportionate access to COVID-19 vaccines. Lack of access to time off work and health care meant the Latinx people had some of the lowest vaccine rates even in communities with high Latinx population. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that a lot of work still needs to be done for my Latinx community and I hope to be a part of that positive change as a Latinx physician one day.","I serve my Latinx community as a scribe at the Westminster Free Clinic. I became a scribe here while at home from Stanford during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the increase in patient needs. I work with different doctors every week and they rely on Spanish-speaking high school volunteers to translate. I noticed a disconnect between patient and physician as the physicians would address the translators with questions and answers instead of their patients. I convinced my Spanish speaking, Latina, physician mother to volunteer with me and saw an increase in the quality of patient care. Patients were more comfortable and would request my mother at later visits. I loved witnessing patients receive culturally and linguistically competent care while actively helping them receive this care. I worked at this clinic every week until I was able to go back to school and now that I have graduated, I will continue to work there until I start medical school.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted my ability to conduct research and complete my honor thesis project.

I hit another issue getting lab materials due to supply chain disruptions and ineffective carcinogen batches.

As I read that phrase in my mammography analysis, I had no idea what it meant. As a 21-year-old, with only biology and biochemistry under her belt, I had never learned how to read medical results, let alone mammography ones. Because I always feel the need to understand every bit of information that is thrown at me, I immediately looked it up in the Internet, knowing this could be a big mistake. The first thing I read was “suspicious finding or abnormality. In this instance there is a 20 to 30% chance of cancer.” I gasped. At first, I could not fathom undergoing the pain that I saw my mother, a breast cancer survivor, go through. When my mom saw the look on my face, she immediately understood the fear displayed in my expression. I was terrified. But once I saw her, I understood that if I had the strength to help the person that I love the most confront cancer, I must have the resilience to face it myself. 

My parents and I called every doctor we could think of that would help us understand what these results meant and what steps needed to be taken. After days of looking for help, a general surgeon with a specialty in breast cancer told us that because the mass had increased in size, it needed to be taken out. Thankfully, she was able to perform the operation the following week. Before I met her, I researched thoroughly what it meant to have a growing 4 cm fibroadenoma. I prepared myself to use and understand the complicated scientific terminology I thought I needed when speaking to a surgeon. I was pleasantly surprised with Dr. Negrón; she spoke in simple terms and explained everything without the condescending manner I had expected. It was as if we were just two people conversing, without any linger of a power dynamic. I remember thinking: “This is the kind of doctor I want to be–one that speaks with her patients, not at them.”

While in recovery, I recalled my first mammography appointment two years prior. I began getting them each year since I was 19 when I first palpated the fibroadenoma in my right breast. After my first consultation, the nurses told me that I was going to be all right since the mass appeared to be benign. As I walked out to the waiting room, I saw older women looking at me with pity; I can only imagine it was due to my young age. I soon realized that I was more worried for them than for myself. I knew that my diagnosis was negative, but some of the women there were not going to have the same fate. In the car ride home, I kept thinking that there was another 19-year-old girl, somewhere in the world, that was not as fortunate as me in her test results. I promised myself to never forget that 19-year-old girl as I progress in my career as a medical doctor.

This experience pushed me to work harder as a researcher in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) later that summer. Even though I worked remotely due to the pandemic, I was still passionate about my help in the battle against cancer. As I compared images that displayed controls and knockdowns about the TP53 proto-oncogene, I knew that my work that summer was the beginning of me putting my grain of sand in this field. I started the program enthusiastic of my work; nevertheless, I underwent several obstacles when collaborating with my peers. When I joined my first meeting, I realized that I was at a disadvantage. Due to COVID-19, I only had the opportunity to perform research for half a semester before beginning SURF, while others might have had years of experience. Moreover, I became aware of my accent when speaking to my peers in English, which caused me to be more nervous and in turn pronounced my Hispanic accent even more. I became self-conscious, began participating less, and dreaded my final presentation. Nevertheless, I kept thinking about that 19-year-old girl that felt the fear of facing a cancer diagnosis. My promise to help her pushed me to overcome the language barrier and do my best when informing about my project. After I finished solidifying the results and prepping the presentation, I practiced every day to get it perfect; I spoke to myself in front of a mirror, and practiced incessantly with my parents and friends until I felt confident. Once I finished, I was proud of my current self, but most importantly, I assured my past, insecure self, that our commitment to help in the fight against cancer was not over. Quite to the contrary, it was just beginning. 

Since then, I have not ceased in my research not only through wet laboratory experiments, but in the clinical field as well. This year, I began working as a Spanish clinical research coordinator at Memorial Sloan Kettering, a place where I can finally use my bilingualism in the pursuit of my passion: helping care for cancer patients. Without these hurdles, I might have never been sure in my choice of pursuing a career in medicine. These experiences have shaped me to be the 22-year-old woman I am today: capable of overcoming the many obstacles that life will undoubtedly throw at me, and more passionate than ever to become the empathetic, caring, professional physician that will be able to help the 19-year-old girl facing a cancer diagnosis.","I recognize that my ethnicity and gender alone contribute to the diversity at Rush Medical College. Yet, it is not merely being a Puerto Rican woman, but growing up with and embracing the values of my culture‚Äîcompassion, inclusiveness, and vivaciousness‚Äîthat I feel define me. It is in sharing these values and in being open to learn from others‚Äô that a truly diverse student body benefits us all. My determination to broaden my understanding of my culture as well as others led me to take music, language and sociology courses and thrive in experiences beyond the premed track. These discussions about poetry, politics, and even dance with students from around the world have taught me the importance of having multiple perspectives for each student to grow. I am sure that as I share these passions with my fellow students at RSM, they will also share their own so that we can continue to enrich each other‚Äôs experience. ","The American Cancer Society says that Hispanics face greater cancer disparities due to ‚Äúdisproportionate poverty, higher percentage uninsured,‚Äù etc. When my mother and other close family members were diagnosed with breast cancer, while testing negative for their BRCA gene, I took it upon myself to do what I could for her and others like her. To start, I joined the Carol Prives Cancer Laboratory to study proto-oncogenic genes like TP53 in the MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic and 468 breast cancer cell line. At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, I became a Spanish Clinical Research Coordinator to help the Latinx communities in both the IMAGINE and EMPOWER Latinx studies. As I interview them asking how genetic counseling materials could be improved and adapted for their populations and teaching them how to cope with their medical anxieties, I learn ways to better communicate with patients. I look forward to continuing to help underserved communities at Rush Medical College.

I felt socially stunted, but also my development as a researcher halted completely. I was still an adamant emailer to others to at least mimic an in-person dynamic and set up calls with fellow researches to discuss experimental results. Moreover, I was disappointed that my opportunities for clinical experiences practically disappeared due to the pandemic. Since the IMAGINE and EMPOWER Latinx studies at Memorial Sloan Kettering are hybrid, we rely on the patients‚Äô physicians to approach them, but our referrals come in small amounts.

2023,15449250,,23,Man,USA,0,,0,1,"As the son of undocumented Mexican parents, I witnessed economic inequality between people of color and majority individuals. We experienced living paycheck by paycheck and finding side jobs for extra income.

Due to my last name, the concept of higher education was never an idea as I was advised to consider trade school as I was unlikely to succeed past high school. My advisor skimmed my transcript for 10 seconds, and I was placed into remedial courses. Even after advocating for myself and testing into honors classes, I was frequently pulled out of class for English as a Second Language matching test to verify I could speak English. I was the only student pulled out as my competence was being questioned all four years. 

I experienced a lack of representation not only in classes but in healthcare, as my experience with Hispanic physicians was nonexistent. My family and I suffered from a language barrier as no physician resonated with my culture. I developed a passion for diversifying our institutions and being a role model for those after me while managing to give back to the community which built me in an effort to be a beacon of progress, not menial labor.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,5564,1700.0,250.0,250.0,650.0,164.0,1,500,1,1064,01/20/2022,Loyola University Chicago,Biology,0,,No,No,No,"Less than $25,000",4,0,1,1,46.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.0,20.0,21,Significant,3,2023,2,5.0,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,"My voice quivered as I translated the doctor's words into Spanish for my family: ""No entiendo porque est aquí, con sus niveles de azúcar, le puede dar un coma diabético. Le recomiendo que se vaya a emergencia lo antes posible."" Translation: ""I don't understand why you are here with such high sugar levels; I recommend you get to the emergency room as soon as possible."" These words simultaneously left my dad speechless and sank my heart. We thought his diagnosis of diabetes was an inevitable death sentence ticking to take my beloved father. After witnessing the fear in my dad's eyes, I knew it was my responsibility to make sure he understood his diagnosis. My dad has always been a mechanically inclined handyman that needed simple terms that I could translate. I googled ""blood sugar for dummies"" to find explanations I could wrap my head around. For several nights, I stayed up reading article after article about glucose pathways and insulin, wanting to medically understand my dad's condition. The need to understand what made his sugar level so dangerous created my initial spark to pursue medicine. 

I knew that there must be thousands of other patients struggling with English, compounded with a lack of medical comprehension, so in an effort to help people like my father, I volunteered at Old Irving Park Community Clinic, a free clinic for uninsured patients. The vast majority of patients we see are Hispanic, with most being Spanish-speaking only. One day, I met ""José,"" a contractor from Peru. We learned that José had frequently been waking up throughout the night to urinate with persistent thirstiness for several months. He assumed these were just symptoms of getting old and brushed them off. Unfortunately, the blood tests showed that José was suffering from diabetes. However, breaking the bad news was different this time. Before entering the room, the doctor and I discussed how to effectively communicate the difficult news to a patient. He advised me not to beat around the bush but also to convey that everything would be okay and to be ready to provide clarification and reassurance after such a heavy diagnosis. I had to communicate the importance of the statement without frightening him. I was terrified because although it was the doctor's diagnosis, it was coming out of my mouth, and it would be my delivery that the patient would remember. I sat next to José, and with a calm and gentle voice, I emphasized that his diabetes could be managed and that it was far from the death sentence I thought my dad was given. We had a heart-to-heart conversation about how I went through a similar predicament with my father, thinking that his situation was hopeless. I saw my dad in José, and I was transported 10 years in the past. But this time, I knew what to do. We ran through his diet, dissecting his favorite meal (chilaquiles) and finding minor tweaks on how he could control his sugar. We established medication and exercise habits to turn his unhealthy life around. I tried to think of every piece of advice I wish my dad had received and applied it to José. The relationship I built with José continues to be one of the most rewarding interactions at OIPCC, as he returns each month with his blood sugars looking better and him appearing healthier with every visit.

While my interaction with José was incredibly fulfilling, I felt that I wanted to be more than his translator; I wanted to be his physician. I want to take it further and work with patients to best manage their diagnoses and provide implementable solutions for the future. I aspire to be the person researching new and innovative ways to help patients while relating to my patients in the way I knew my dad needed. My dad required more than a physiology lesson; he needed a plan and regimen to follow. Something I learned from my father and José was the needed consistent and accessible guidance for patients after their appointments. This led me to create ""Eat this, Not that""  bilingual infographics with universal visual aids and labels to help patients curtail their special diet that enables them to become healthier. Through working with various patients, I learned that while languages are unique, photos can be universal. I began to add visuals of labels and brands that could be applied to any demographic. I knew my initiative was successful when José returned 3 months later with a reduced HbA1C and the same paper I printed for him.

I strive to be the physician that not only provides treatments but also takes the time to sit down and thoroughly understand every patient's unique situation, ensuring that they know that they are being heard and cared for. I want my patients to believe that my support for them does not stop at the end of their visit - that I’ll be there for them when they have late-night calls with concerns or need a simple medication explanation. I aspire to be the most passionate advocate for my patients, where I hope to foster a relationship where they feel comfortable expressing their deepest concerns, regardless of their background and culture. More than anything, I want to replace my patients' worries with hope whenever possible, and convert their once concerned looks into reassured, hopeful smiles.","Working up ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù as the new patient to the clinic, he told me how this was his first appointment in years due to his battle with homelessness and past history of being a felon. Joe shared his intense feelings with me about being stigmatized by the community which opened my eyes to the impact that a community can have on one‚Äôs health. I have witnessed how ex-felons are judged by a mistake and haunted for the rest of their lives. I believe that the job of a doctor is not to judge but to be of service to the patient regardless of their background. I believe that as doctors, we straddle the line between community and patient and must work to progress our community to improve the social aspect of health. I learned that while some communities can be unwelcoming, I can and will be the change by treating each patient with the love and respect they deserve, regardless of their diverse background or past.","Meals on Wheels is a community-based organization where volunteers deliver hot meals and perform wellness checks on a daily basis. I frequently visit Mr. Cook, an 85-year-old individual recovering from a newly repaired hernia. During my first few visits, I started by rearranging his fridge and cleaning up his living room. I could see the gratitude in his eyes but I wanted to do more than tidy up. While cleaning, I noticed he was struggling with mobility and spent most of his time on his recliner. I went home thinking of how we can improve his living space. I had the idea to create a remote stand that helped him organize his remote, store his phone for emergencies, and snacks so he would not have to get up. Mr. Cook‚Äôs face of gratitude made my day as something so minuscule provided so much relief. Every week, I always make sure to leave Mr. Cook at the end of my route because I know he needs extra attention. I hope to make the same impactful relationships with my future patients.",,,1,"Originally, I was set to shadow multiple physicians in the months leading up to what was the beginning of the pandemic shutdown. My mosquito research was also disrupted as I was to test a yeast encapsulated larvacide that was never sent to me. I transitioned my project towards studying mosquito upkeep and antioxidant SOS defense. While my CHARISMA fellowship transitioned online, I took the opportunity to work on a relevant issue and choose a Vitamin D versus COVID-19 study. While speaking with patients, I learned of a common thread of COVID misinformation, especially around non-English speakers. Through remote recruiting, we worked to dispel common misconceptions and encourage research participation to gather helpful information against COVID.

2023,15449615,,23,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"I left the United States as a baby and only returned at the age of 9. During that time, I grew up in Japan and Brazil due to my mother's job situating her there. Upon arriving in the United States, I had to achieve fluency in English and assimilate into broader American society. The process of learning English took years, but I did eventually become fluent. This linguistic barrier made me an outsider in American society for years and still sticks with me and my loved ones. The same difficulties eleven-year-old me experienced when attempting to navigate American institutions- from healthcare to education- still stand with me. I often find myself as an outsider in my peer groups or professional environments, as my traditional cultural values are both a ready justification for exclusion or isolation. However, I have come to resonate with these qualities and create a purpose for my life. Although I am an American citizen and have effectively assimilated into American Society, I have effectively lived as an immigrant.

As a sweltering summer enters its twilight days, I spend them as an inpatient at the University of Tokyo Hospital. This isn’t my first time in a hospital- as an immunodeficient kid, doctor’s visits are more routine than trips to the zoo. However, this is different; I’ve never spent more than a week in a hospital, but this time over a month has slipped by. I’m aware that something is seriously wrong, but I can’t even pronounce tuberculosis let alone know the significance of my airborne isolation room. 

Every day, my sister visits me to tell me about her day and what’s going on in the world beyond my window. These stories replace my favorite afterschool cartoons and are a clear distraction from my grave situation. However, even as the possibility of a lobectomy is passed among them, the doctors that visit keep my spirit strong and let me fight on. As the trees in the world beyond my window turn brown, the confidence and care my doctor approaches my treatment with never allows me or my family to give up or relent, even as my condition recovers. 

As the last days of my discharge plan come to an end and the first snow of winter falls, I leave the hospital. For what feels like the first time in my life, I enter the world beyond my window- now lightly powdered by a light snowfall. Even though the beauty of Tokyo in the winter sprawls around me, the awe I felt towards my doctor stands in my mind harder than the scenery around me, leaving a mental impression never wavers. 

I am sixteen years old.

The final bell rings and amongst the mass rush of hundreds of students, my friend Chyou and I walk through the main building of our high school towards the exit. Our typical subjects of discussion include the results of the presidential election, Dr. Strange, and recently- her pregnancy. As we wait out front for our parents to pick us up, she expresses a shaky excitement for her child and her future. At age 16, her child will delay, if not outright cancel, any plans she previously had. It’s been like this ever since she found out, as her parent’s strict values and her health concerns as a teenage mom have drastically changed what she previously imagined as the start of her adult life. 

But, just as our conversation shifts to a less personal subject, my dad’s car arrives and I leave. As I pull away from school, my view of Chyou slowly fades among the sea of cars arriving at the pick-up area and the weekend begins. 

During the first class on Monday, among yawns and general grogginess of AP Econ, the principal calls me and some of my friends to the principal’s office. When we arrive, we are told news that hits us harder than any shot of caffeine could have on that cold November morning.
 
Chyou has passed away. Her family has requested for us to know, but since they do not know English they have chosen to have the school counselor inform us. Over the coming days, I would learn that Chyou had suffered an ectopic pregnancy. She did not seek medical attention and passed away that weekend. Chyou’s parents, as foreigners who did not understand English and had shaky citizenship status, did not seek immediate medical attention for her until it was too late. 

When I knew them, Chyou’s parents had avoided interacting with healthcare, as their inability to speak English made them feel alienated from many American institutions, including medicine. To them, it was easier to rely on their culture’s medicine rather than risk deportation or attempt to cross the linguistic barrier. As outsiders, there was, and always will be, difficulty making that jump into a society they saw as unwelcoming. 

Throughout my entire life, I have lived and breathed the story of a foreigner in the countries and cultures I have walked through. In Japan, I lived as a Brazilian boy in a society that was 99% Asian. In the United States, I lived as an ice-cold chunk amongst the famed American melting pot due to my initial inability to speak English. Even though I have long overcome that barrier and have long been an American citizen, I still understand the hesitancy that Chyou’s family felt. I know the weight that an immigrant can feel when they do try to interact with the institutions of another country. At the same time, I know the impact a doctor who crosses these barriers can have- like those who treated me at the University of Tokyo all those years ago. A doctor who can break these barriers goes beyond their scope of practice, becoming a figure that not only heals the body, but also the divide between people.
 
To me, access to healthcare is a human right. The doctor, and man, I aim to become shares this human right with all by crossing the cultural barriers many immigrants face as outsiders to American institutions. I aim to hold my foreigner emblem loud and proud, using my ability to speak different languages to create a space for as many as I can within healthcare. My life will always be a learning process, as I seek to understand cultures different from my own and integrate my knowledge into my efforts. With every person I bring into healthcare, I hope to prevent someone from meeting Chyou’s fate, and if I’m lucky, inspire others to set on the path towards expanding the spaces I aim to create.","I spent the first nine years of my life in foreign countries. For the first eight, I lived in Hokkaido, Japan, where my Latino heritage stood out like a nail among the almost entirely Japanese community around me. However, even in an environment where I was different from nearly everyone, I still internalized the values of Japanese society and partially assimilated. At the age of eight, I moved to Brazil, where the values I acquired in Japan slammed into an entirely different people and society. Here, I experienced a core aspect of the immigrant experience for the first time- that of being an outsider. These years of my life opened my understanding of the differences between people, particularly their importance and irrelevance. On the one hand, humanity has used cultural differences to justify atrocities out of ethnocentrism. On the other hand, there is strength in blending our cultural differences, as in spaces where all walks of life can coexist, a peerless tomorrow rises.  ","I believe that healthcare must understand what influences health outside the strict clinical sense. By this, I mean healthcare must understand how culture, tradition, finances, and many other factors cause someone to develop an illness. During my undergraduate years, I worked to establish clinics staffed with people that represented their local community. For example, in Koreatown, I sought out medical professionals of a Korean background or who grew up in Koreatown. However, in East LA, I sought healthcare professionals who understood the Latino experience in this country- especially those who grew up in that area. In doing this, I created teams of medical professionals that could treat patients with the power of shared experience. While our intention was never to stop COVID, we knew we could make people comfortable with the clinics we created. I intend to spend my entire medical career creating spaces where the sociocultural aspects of my community are understood and empowered.",,,1,"I ask Rush to consider the circumstances behind the only Pass/No Pass courses I have ever had in my undergraduate career.

With my personal connection to them, along with the general disorder of the class taken into consideration, I decided to put the class as Pass/No Pass. Furthermore, I put two classes in the winter 2022 semester on Pass/No Pass. This was due to the general uncertainty and confusion surrounding the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which caused UCLA to be virtual for the first half of the quarter and in-person for the second half.

Whether playing for my high school team or watching games, I was glued to the sport on and off the field. That attachment ended during a playoff match against our high school rival. My teammate crossed the ball, and I sprinted 30 yards to reach it, only to be brutally slide tackled by the opposing defender. As I landed on my shoulder, I felt a snap, and my shriek reverberated around the stadium. A bit dazed, my teammates assisted me off the pitch. The pain became intolerable when the adrenaline wore off, and I was rushed to urgent care. I could feel the sharp needles in my shoulder as I described what had happened to the physician. I stated I hadn't broken a bone before as he nodded and performed a routine assessment. He predicted a clavicle fracture and ordered x-rays to confirm while confidently dictating the treatment plan. With just a touch the physician had effortlessly handled my crisis. He assuaged my worries about the prognosis while placing me in a sling and ensured a referral to an orthopedic expert. In that instance, the physician comforted me during one of my most vulnerable moments. Impressed by his expertise, the moment sparked my respect and curiosity toward healthcare professionals

After discharge, I consulted with Dr. Olufade, a sports medicine physician. As I entered the clinic, I was reassured to see signed jerseys on the wall and a thank you sign from the success stories he had assisted. While sitting on the examination table, I reminisced over the years I spent playing soccer and wondered whether Dr. Olufade could repeat that same success with me. I asked about his medical journey and how he helps patients bounce back from traumatic sports injuries. He described his battle with an ACL tear, which he uses as motivation to heal others. As he validated my concerns, I was encouraged by the parallels in our stories and realized I could help people too. As I followed up with him throughout high school, his mentorship increased my depth of understanding of the medical field and inspired me to pursue experiences persistently but thoughtfully. Dr. Olufade's determination to provide a sense of hope to others and his excellence in going above and beyond the call were contagious and further kindled my spark to pursue medicine

As I started college, I relied on this spark to further my scientific aptitude. While the academic rigor increased, so did the physical demands. Even though I replaced the hours spent playing soccer with research and pre-med courses, my routine escape from the stress still revolved around my love for the sport. However, as I played a game over the weekend, I missed the ball and kicked the ground instead, resulting in an aching pain in my hip as the weeks went by. Tylenol eased my discomfort while I inched closer to graduation, but as the pandemic began to climax and lockdown ensued, my pain worsened as I limped around my home. The COVID-19 restrictions impacted my access to care; symptoms of sciatica and muscle spasms ate away my physical and mental health as I prepared for medical school applications. Months later, an MRI arthrogram confirmed the torn labrum. As I visited Dr. Olufade, I recognized I had reached rock bottom. Determined to improve, I attended physical therapy over the next few months and did not let my injury deter me from providing support to others during the pandemic. During my recovery, I shadowed Dr. Gavaller, a geriatric physician. On our rounds, I studied the patient-physician interaction when battling chronic comorbidities. Retrospectively, fighting through my discomfort made me more empathetic and allowed me to understand better how to provide comfort to others

One such occasion was during a visit with Ms. R, a 92-year-old patient transferred to our facility after a cerebrovascular accident. She complained of worsening chest pain since her stroke with an inability to sleep. As I reviewed her medical chart, I was shocked. She had a history of a myocardial infarction secondary to coronary artery disease, further exacerbating her chest pain. She was previously prescribed nitroglycerin to manage her symptoms, but surprisingly, it was discontinued before the stroke. With her chronic conditions, pain, and sleeping difficulties, I knew the complexity of Ms. R's clinical intervention. As the physical assessment began, I informed Dr. Gavaller about the discontinued nitroglycerin, and she assured me she would order the prescription. The following day, the shine in Ms. R's eyes was impossible to ignore as she reported a whole night of sleep after dealing with weeks of unrest. For the first time in my life, I truly understood how impactful compassionate care could be. Listening to her concerns and incorporating them with a thorough physical exam and review of her past medical history, I was able to replace Ms. R's discomfort with comfort

What started as a flicker of hope during the dark moments of my journey has since ignited my calling in life. As I evolved along my path, each experience materialized into steps that prepared me to become a physician. I am excited and a touch nervous about this next step in life, but I am confident I will rise to the call. I hope the selection committee considers me favorably.","Due to the geographical distance, I learned to embrace Indian culture overseas. We planned our trip to the Padmanabhan Temple in Kerala during a visit. Before entering, devotees replace foreign clothing with a Dhoti. I instructed my sister to remove her watch when a man shouted, ""He is American, not Indian."" As we were forced to leave the temple, being discriminated against in my home country left me distraught. _x000D_
_x000D_
However, I am grateful it occurred upon reminiscing on the exchange. As a future medical student, my experience taught me the power of respecting fundamental human rights, such as the freedom of religion and the freedom of speech. I hope to use my experience to ensure that no patient feels the way I did that day. Given the diversity of the class, my journey made me confident that I can be part of a family that has a role in diminishing the inequalities we see as we become physicians that treat a diverse patient population.","While assisting families at the Northlake Mall Vaccination Clinic in inner-city Atlanta, we talked about our lifestyles during the pandemic. I was shocked to hear stories that described a lack of education and safety regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. The absence of testing kits, clinics, and doctors only further exacerbated the stigmas regarding treatment. The disproportionate percentage of patients that were minorities demonstrated that pre-existing social inequalities tied to race, class, and access to healthcare were becoming increasingly stratified. _x000D_
_x000D_
By incorporating the stories of patients with clinical research, I realized the significance of what I was doing. I learned how urban medicine is directly responsible for ensuring that high-risk communities have strong social provision programs that address inadequate housing and access to healthcare. I am confident Rush University will allow me to work closely with communities to improve access to excellent preventative treatment._x000D_

2023,15451371,,28,Woman,USA,1,EO1,0,1,"Born to an unprepared couple in a lower income neighborhood in St. Louis, my arrival placed additional strains on them. In an effort to improve living conditions, they took to sprucing up the older house exposing me to the dust of lead-based paint and sending me to the hospital with severe lead poisoning as an infant. My hospitalization was the first major incident that led my grandparents to financially and emotionally support my mother and I. Within the next year they suggested that we move to Nevada with them, allowing my mother escape the abuse of my biological father.  

In this new city, my mother and I were dependent upon the Women, Infant, and Children’s (WIC) program and the aid of my grandparents. Although some aspects of life improved, my well-being as a child was overshadowed by my mother’s vices. Better living conditions and opportunities came later when I was adopted, but did not fully shield me from the drugs and alcohol that were a bigger part of my biological mother’s life.

Being raised by a single mother with lifelong substance abuse, and having to take care of her through multiple relapses, I was forced to grow up fast. By the age of seven, I had survived physical abuse and was accustomed to celebrating delayed holidays and birthdays at whichever jail or rehab my mother was in at that given time. Aware of the toxicity and impact this could have on my future, I was internally motivated to avoid becoming a statistic based on my mother’s disease of addiction. To cope with the instability, I sought refuge in my academics and sports, and successfully took control of my own life by entering the courts to obtain better guardianship. Taking charge of my disorderly childhood was the first of many steps in my path towards medicine, which at its core is fueled by a desire to help others in need.
 
As a first-generation college student, I became passionate about community health. I volunteered with outreach programs such as the Sunshine Nevada Organization and the local Community Emergency Response Team, which opened my eyes to the power of preventative health initiatives. These experiences helped guide my decision to pursue my Master’s in Public Health. Excited to explore the intersection between health policy and law, I ultimately found myself gravitating towards clinically-focused projects over the course of my studies. I was fortunate to work with the thoracic surgery department at Massachusetts General Hospital through an initiative that reduced patient wait times and eliminated redundancies in the scheduling process. As one of my first exposures to clinical medicine, I found this work intriguing and sought opportunities to continue engaging with patient care.
 
While drafting a policy brief to implement a clinic-based program focusing on childhood obesity, I came across the work of the Integrated Center for Group Medical Visits (ICGMV). Dedicated to increasing access to primary care with the use of group visits, this non-profit organization provides integrative healthcare to an underserved community and educates other medical professionals to do the same. What started as an informative interview for my project led to me volunteering for the center in any capacity needed at the start of the pandemic. After three months of helping expand the center to offer virtual group visits, scheduling training sessions, and coordinating group sessions for medical school residents, I was offered a long-term position. Since then, I have continued working to grow the organization by expanding partnerships with international organizations and foundations to provide more group programs for the community, as well as regularly engaging with physicians incorporating the group medical visit model into their own practices.
 
Through my role with ICGMV I have been fortunate to meet and work alongside many physicians motivated to reduce health disparities. By stepping into the clinic, I have had the opportunity to observe the role primary care physicians play in patient-centered care. I have observed physicians collaborate with patients to uncover the root cause of symptoms, utilize alternative methods to foster healing, and to empower patients to manage their own health through the support found in group visits. Directly witnessing the importance of the doctor-patient relationship and the power of providing holistic, integrative care in the midst of a pandemic was truly inspiring. These clinical experiences taught me how physicians can cultivate connection and serve as an advocate for their patients' lifelong health and well-being.
 
At the time, I had no idea that my path to medicine began with my early exposure to my mother’s disease of addiction. In the case of my mother’s life, preventative healthcare that incorporated mental health and social services may have made all the difference in her struggles with addiction. Perhaps this could even be provided as a group medical program, similar to the one for fathers with substance use disorder previously held by ICGMV where they collectively wrote a children’s book and received medical services and counseling. Witnessing the impact that physicians can have within their communities has been influential and confirmed my desire to practice medicine. I am deeply committed to spending my career improving the lives of my future patients as a physician in similar ways. I hope to implement my training in public health and organizational experience to work in a preventative health setting in which I can help provide multidisciplinary care to an underserved population.","I have been fortunate to gain exposure to the diversity of care delivery and the disparities between populations. Assisting the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and conducting research with Lahey Hospital, highlighted the luxuries of Boston being a global healthcare hub. On the other end of the spectrum, serving as an intern for a pedorthic clinic, a volunteer and employee for ICGMV, as well as shadowing in an underserved community, I gained valuable insight into the patient‚Äôs perspective of health and healthcare. These experiences opened my eyes to community initiatives that could lessen the current barriers to primary care for people residing in diverse settings. Furthermore, by having the opportunity to interact with diverse patients I have become more aware of the barriers to care that low income communities face on a daily basis as well as gain a realistic understanding of what it takes to be a primary care physician in an underserved community.","In 2020, I began helping the non-profit organization, ICGMV in a number of ways. I have made the most impact by assisting in the implementation of free, group programs for the community members of Lawrence, a city with the highest poverty in Massachusetts. Early programs included adult exercise classes that considered physical limitations and trauma-informed yoga with counseling. In the last year we have received a number of grants to start new programs such as a Nutrition and Functional Medicine program led by a dietitian to help patients learn how their bodies respond to food, an after-school pediatric empowerment program that promotes healthy lifestyles and exercise for community youth, and mental health groups that provide counseling and other health services for free. By helping acquire funding, coordinating  programs, and ensuring patient accessibility, I have had the opportunity to reduce barriers to care and help transform the overall health of the community of Lawrence",,,1,"I began my post-baccalaureate program in May 2020 and was met with the academic rigor of learning science as a non-traditional student and doing so remotely. Similarly, plans of conducting in-person research with the opportunity to regularly shadow at the hospital were limited due to restrictions. The culmination of the internal pressures to excel academically, maintain my involvement with a non-profit, and uphold my fitness, in addition to the stress of the pandemic, triggered a battle with my own body. After many doctor visits and lab tests, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and was at the tail end of a three month flare. With the support of my physicians, I have since improved my health both medically and holistically. I am grateful to have experienced these challenges as they have allowed me to gain a greater perspective as a patient, better understand the demands placed on physicians, as well as given me the confidence to continue to face a challenging academic workload.",1,1,1

Awaiting her return, I swiveled side to side in her massive office chair when suddenly she emerged to check on me. I beamed and asked what she was doing out there. Readying to leave, she explained, “Sometimes babies are born too early and get sick. I help them so that they can live.” As the door locked behind her, I realized how badly I wanted to be out there with her. I wanted to help the babies live, too. 
For most of my childhood, my parents kept us far from the hospital, which I later learned was their determination not to force their career on their children. However, the silence gnawed at me for years until one day, I asked Mom if she would take me to work with her in the NICU. That day, I experienced a light inside me as Mom moved from one room to the next, checking heartbeats, conferring with nurses, comforting her sleeping patients. Witnessing the personal and practical impact Mom had in the unit was gratifying because I could see the values instilled in me as a child come to life in a professional setting. In that moment, I promised myself that one day I would no longer live vicariously through Mom in her profession as a physician. Instead, I would become one. But first, I would need to explore my own passion for medicine.
Around the same time, I found myself drawn to the realm of psychology after facing the necessity of calling 911 for a friend who overdosed on pills in an attempted suicide. Captivated by the mechanisms underlying a person’s actions and wanting to alleviate the burdens of those in emotional pain, I joined Cornell’s Empathy, Assistance, and Referral Service (EARS) to engage in peer counseling. While counseling “Katie,” I could not ignore the pain in her eyes as she conveyed to me the difficulty she was having being understood in her classes due to her accent. At once, fear ravaged my mind, as I worried that I might struggle to understand her, too. However, somewhere in that anxious spiral, I remembered the wisdom given to me regarding the role of an EARS member: our job is to create an open, empathetic environment where people feel welcome to share themselves. As long as we have done that, we have fulfilled our goal. I took a breath, exhaling the clutter of my mind.
“It sounds like you’re feeling lonely because you want to build connections with your classmates and professors, but you fear they will misunderstand you. Does this sound correct to you?” Sure enough, she confirmed that I had heard her correctly, and we spoke for another hour, her sharing her story with me, and me reflecting it back to her so we could continue to explore her feelings about the situation. I ended my shift taking note of how I felt: fulfilled by the immediate impact I had on Katie’s wellbeing, but troubled knowing there was more to her story. I had helped her, but I had not healed her.
My time in EARS led me to seek out similar opportunities with a more diverse population and the possibility of life-threatening issues. This pursuit is how I found the Crisis Text Line and later, is how I found myself on the other side of a message from “Jamie” telling me that they were about to take all their pills and end their life. After an intense round of texts that almost resulted in my supervisor performing an active rescue, I tried approaching Jamie the same way I had simpler situations: “I’m hearing that you feel there is no way to escape your pain besides taking these pills, and it seems like no one can understand how you feel. It also sounds like you’re really wishing for someone to connect with so you can gain relief. Is that correct?” To my surprise, Jamie immediately softened, and I was able to keep them safe throughout the rest of our conversation. I thought to myself, what a crucial thing it is to feel heard and understood, even, or perhaps especially when one is physically and emotionally very close to death. In feeling what it was like to get someone through what I presume was one of the worst days of their life, so bad that they no longer wanted to be here, I felt inspired to become a physician and provide that same level of support to patients on the worst days of their lives as well.
My counseling experiences have taught me how passionate I am about personal connection within the role of a physician and accessible mental healthcare within medicine as a whole. After working with hundreds experiencing a variety of issues from everyday stress to impending suicide, I appreciated that to alleviate emotional and behavioral issues, I first had to connect with what the individual was experiencing, as they experienced it, before brainstorming any plan of action. I hope to be a physician so I may serve as a leader in my patients’ care by considering all aspects of their personhood, and to me, this process begins with a foundation of mutual trust and understanding. In addition to treating the ailments a patient presents to me, I aspire to connect with my patients in a way that leaves them feeling as though they have truly been seen. This, I believe, is a strength that transcends the boundary of physician and patient, bringing us to our knees in awe of our humanity.","This year I have returned to work in New Orleans, and a great deal of the patients who enter our vaccination clinic are racial minorities, uninsured or publicly insured, and/or low-income. Many of these patients have not seen a doctor in years, and in these cases, we are their first interaction with healthcare in a long time. While I was fortunate enough to grow up with an attitude of trust towards medical professionals, I recognize that other folks may not have had the same experience. When patients are reluctant to put their bags down or trust us to shred their personal information, I am reminded that it is a privilege to be trusted by patients, and I must work to build a productive relationship with my all of my patients through rapport and empathetic approaches. It is extremely important to me that patients‚Äô time in our clinic is filled with warmth and respect so that they associate health with positivity despite what they might be experiencing in other parts of their lives.","While learning about barriers to receiving treatment for mental health conditions, I was struck by how many obstacles individuals face in order to obtain adequate care. Issues such as stigma, expenses, and wait times prevent people from receiving the care they deserve. For this reason, I naturally gravitated towards activities in college that could help people having these experiences. _x000D_

One of the reasons I joined Crisis Text Line (CTL) was to help those who needed care but for one reason or another could not find professional help. Throughout my time on the platform, I have engaged with folks who cannot afford care or whose family will not let them seek care. While the nature of the work I do on the platform does not allow me to develop longitudinal relationships with texters, I do what I can in the moment, and I am elated that CTL keeps a directory of resources that I can share with texters, including ways to find affordable professional help such as counseling and support groups.",,,1,"Due to my parents working in hospitals and nursing homes, they contracted COVID-19 in early April 2020, leaving them bedridden for weeks. At the time, I felt terrified for my parents with a disease about which we knew very little. Fortunately, my parents eventually recuperated; however, they suffered lasting symptoms from their illness months after the fact. Also during this time, Cornell moved all operations fully online, which continued in some capacity throughout my junior year._x000D_

Additionally, I experienced professional barriers due to the COVID-19 regulations regarding unessential personnel in healthcare settings. My plans to serve as a volunteer at hospitals in Ithaca, NY and New Orleans, LA and to shadow physicians were regrettably canceled in 2020 and 2021. While I am remiss I was unable to actively participate at that time, I appreciate that these regulations were to ensure public safety, and I am savoring my current clinical activities.",0,0,2

He was yelling for help.  There was a girl on the ground.  She had been found in the bushes, unconscious and unclothed. I ran to the girl and dropped to my knees.  I told an observer to call our EMS agency, and I did everything I was taught as a lifeguard.  I felt for her pulse, checked her breathing, and asked questions to bystanders. She began to vomit, and I put her on her side. When EMS showed up, I updated them, and they took her to the hospital. As I watched the EMTs work, they executed new techniques that I had never seen before, and I found myself wanting to learn more. As the EMTs were leaving, one of them said “Great quick thinking, you may have saved her life.” I applied to the EMS team that night.  
Since an early age I have been exposed to the medical world through my mother, who is a pediatrician. I had the opportunity to shadow some of her fellow doctors, and I found myself mesmerized by the everyday duties of a doctor. When I got to college, I knew I wanted to pursue a pre-med path, so I sat down with my advisor and set out my entire class schedual for my four years. I have worked throughout high school and college preparing myself for medical school.
During the summer of 2020, I was asked to be the Medical Director at a YMCA camp in Rochester, NY.  The head of that YMCA camp quit on my very first day, and I had to learn to adjust very quickly.  The issues soon surpassed my EMT training. I was sitting on lunch break one day, when one of the teen campers asked if she could sit with me for a while. She chatted about small topics for a while, but I could tell she had something else she wanted to tell me. She eventually opened-up and confided in me that she wanted to kill herself. We continued to talk, and we made a plan.  We spoke with her parents and got her to start talking to a counselor. After the situation calmed down, I realized that EMT training did not teach me how to handle mental health issues. In the future I would like to learn how to handle these hard situations better. The camper was able to continue camp for the rest of the summer, and I was glad to see the big-picture improvements she made with her mental and physical health by August. 
Over the past eight years, I have learned about the medical field, and I have learned about myself. I have shadowed over 15 different types of doctors and increased my knowledge about the different types of medical fields. I observed the doctors I shadowed have good rapport and rapid response with patients, keeping up with emerging science and the big picture. One day I was shadowing a lactation doctor and she began showing a patient a new technique that she said she learned from a recent panel that she attended. Medicine is ever evolving, and it requires continuously learning new material. 
I’ve enjoyed many aspects of my medical journey, and I’ve most enjoyed seeing the positive outcomes of my work.  However, sometimes it can be rare to see the immediate impact of your efforts. For example, while I was working at a YMCA camp, a 6-year-old boy came up to me with a lash on his arm, asking for a band aid. I asked how he hurt himself, as camp had only been open a few minutes, and he replied that it wasn’t his fault. Eventually, he told me that his grandfather has been beating him and he didn’t want to go home. I sat him down with a popsicle and some coloring materials, discussed the situation with YMCA leadership, and went to have the hard talk with Child Protective Services. CPS talked with him that day and got all the information. The boy did go back that night to his family.  From what I learned, the child’s situation improved, but the problem wasn’t completely solved. This opened my eyes to the idea that in the medical field there are many external factors that come into play.  For a long time, I struggled with the idea that I could not completely fix the situation and have learned that I want more training in order to find more ways to help. Throught this experience I learned that health care is a teamwork activity that involves a web of resources available to patients. 
A few weeks after that night my freshman year, while waiting to hear back about my EMT application, I received a “thank you” email from the girl that I had helped. In the next hour, I got my EMS acceptance letter, and I have been working to help my community ever since. Throughout EMS, I have moved up in ranks into an M-1 position where I am the head EMT on all of the calls and work 24-hour shifts. I have enjoyed my time as a leader to the upcoming EMTs.  I have been able to teach them fundamental EMT skills, and they have been able to teach me new tips and tricks. As an EMT, there are many calls that have high stress energy from patients and bystanders that can lead to unsafe environments, so it is crucial to be able to read people and situations. EMS has taught me that I want more clinical experiences to improve my skills. 
I am motivated to build on my medical skills and excited to learn more to help my patients. I believe that all of my training, classes and life experiences have helped me in my journey towards becoming a doctor.","I have had the opportunity to be experience many diverse cultures and environments, such as study abroad, asthma camp for inner-city youth, campus clubs, and a variety of leadership positions.  Asthma camp is a free, 3-day overnight camp where under-privileged Rochester city children were taught how to manage their asthma symptoms while also maintaining healthy, active lifestyles.  As a camp counselor, I began to realize how little the campers knew about their asthma management. After sitting down and talking with them, I realized that they have disproportional access to quality health care. I also found that many of the campers from Rochester city spoke mainly Spanish, which made communication challenging. Throughout the years, I worked on my Spanish so I would be able to communicate and connect with my campers better. I began integrating Spanish in asthma education classes, organizing outdoor activities, educational materials for home, and an end of camp carnival. ","I believe that the best way to reach and impact others is by connecting with them personally. I believe that my experiences, and how I use them to relate to others, makes me a unique individual.  When I was in high school, my older cousin, Mike, was walking home and was killed by a drunk driver. Years later, I realized how much this changed me. It allowed me to better empathize and understand patients.  As a camp counselor, I saw a camper who didn‚Äôt speak much English and didn‚Äôt interact closely with others. I ate lunch with him,and started a simple Spanish conversation. He opened up and explained that his grandma was in the hospital, after being struck by a drunk driver. I was able to empathize with him. Being a doctor isn‚Äôt just about medicine.  It is also about how we relate our experiences to one another. In the future, I hope to connect with my patients in this way in order to provide the best care possible. ",,,1,"March 2020 I was abroad in Maastricht Netherlands when I had to suddenly travel home to the US at 3 am. Once I got home, I had to quarantine in my parents' basement and Zoom in to my classes at 2 am because of the time change. Due to the lag in technology, and travel I missed a week of classes. This semester was an extreme challenge in both my studies and mental health. Over the semester I had to learn how to manage my mental health by taking breaks in studying to go for walks, taking time away from screens, and using mindful practices such as yoga. There was additional stress at home because my mother is a pediatrician who had to continue to work throughout the pandemic. Fall 2020, there was an increased need for EMS on campus due to covid, injuries and mental health issues. Many EMS staff were uncomfortable working, so we became an agency of only 6, which meant I was working over 24 hours each week and more of my time and energy went in to helping my community.",1,0,2

From simple stories, such as taking care of the inebriated, to treating those involved in fatal car crashes or shootings. To me, my mom seemed like she could handle the most extreme sight after having witnessed as much as she has. However, one day, while out at a restaurant with my family, mid-conversation I lose consciousness and fall to the ground. When I came to, just a few minutes later, I would see my mother with tears running down her cheeks. She pulls me in and hugs me asking if I was okay. I could feel her shaking and I told her that I felt fine but she insisted that we head to the hospital. After a few doctor visits, it was concluded that it was a simple episode of vasovagal syncope. However, I never forgot the look my mom had when I woke up. I felt sadness but also anger and frustration towards myself. I could not help but feel responsible for bringing my mother to the point of tears. I began to think about how parents must feel seeing their children in far more critical states than my own. The pain and uncertainty of seeing a loved one in danger eats away at one’s being. As an EMT, I witnessed first-hand what it can be like. I was transporting a 5 month old boy to a Chicago pediatric hospital after the mother had brought him into an acute care center for a seizure. After receiving a report from the nurse, we get the patient ready, and head out on the hour and a half transport. I immediately noticed that the mother was rather anxious, her expression synonymous with my mother’s. I try to provide some reassurance; however, once we get unto the highway she starts hyperventilating, her hands begin to tremble, and she is on the verge of tears. I saw that the five month old was doing fine and turned my attention towards the mother. I tried to talk to her about anything that could take her mind off of the current situation. We talked about her kids, I hoped she could find strength in the love for her children and, thankfully, she was able to calm herself. I felt a greater appreciation for the training I received as an EMT. It gave me the confidence to stay calm in a tense situation and resolve it accordingly. Something that I felt I was unable to do for my mother at the restaurant, now, I am able to do for others.

Many days later, I pick up a military recruit from a VA hospital who was being admitted to a behavioral health facility. When I first met him he did not say a word and kept his head pointed towards the ground. My initial thought was that he was simply exhausted it was around 3 in the morning after all. During transport we started talking about our high school experiences. He told me that he had participated in marching band and that his school had one of the most competitive marching bands in the state. I was taken aback by how much physical training they went through and expressed my amazement at his ability to endure through it all. As we continued talking I noticed that he was feeling a little more comfortable with me, and eventually he talked about the situation in which he found himself in. He told me that he had been sexually assaulted while going through boot camp. He once again turned his gaze towards the ground and a cold silence filled the room. I was not sure of what to say, I don't think there was much I could have said that would have made his world seem less bleak at the time. Yet, I kept talking to him trying to help him in what could possibly be the darkest and loneliest moment of his life. The patient is now faced with unforeseen obstacles through no fault of his own, yet possibly reflecting on his past with regrets. A truly scary and lonely feeling. It is an ugly part of reality; however, one that should not be dealt with alone. Any and all thoughts of what I had going on in my life vanished and only that moment mattered to me. I felt a tremendous sense of responsibility, not simply as an EMT, but as a human being. For him to share something so personal and open up to me, I can only imagine he must have felt something resembling how I felt when I cried to my parents about a school bully as a child. I vividly remember feeling so helpless, vulnerable, and genuinely afraid. However, once my parents took me into their arms and assured me that everything would be alright, that's when I felt truly safe, as well as what I could only describe as love. I realized then what it meant to truly care for others, and how much one simple act of kindness can mean to someone. Many years later, I would be confronted with yet another bully. Only then, it would be my friends that would come to my aid.

Through my friends and family, I was able to come as far as I have, and for them I will strive even further and work towards my goals. Thanks to my medical training and experiences as an EMT, I was able to mature and assist those who found themselves facing adversity. From the mother with an ill child, to the military recruit who lived through something few could truly understand. I wish to continue to help many more like them by going to medical school. As well as to grow, both into someone my family and I can be proud of, and into someone that is a good role model for future generations.","As an EMT, I once transported an older male patient from a facility to a behavioral health hospital. From the time we met, he was very adamant about being uncooperative as well as disrespectful. I wondered why he was being the way that he was towards someone that he's never met. He lashed out at my partner and showed no interest in receiving any sort of help. However, once we arrived at the receiving facility, he seemed to be more cooperative and even engaged in conversation with the security guards working there. I wondered what had changed, at first I thought he was simply intimidated by them, but then he asked one of the guards where he was from. It then hit me that the patient was possibly just defensive against others who did not visibly appear to be able to understand his situation or past experiences. I was ashamed that I had possibly misjudged him. It should be possible to disagree with someone and still respect each other; however, I learned that it is not always so simple.","As an older sibling, I hope that I have made the right decisions in order to set an example for my brother. I once had a conversation with a military recruit and I mentioned that I believed setting high expectations for my brother would hinder his confidence and that I did not wish for him to feel like he was behind. He said that I was mistaken, that my brother would see everything I had done and that those accomplishments themselves would encourage him to reach for new heights. I was able to reflect on what it meant to have certain expectations of others and came to my own conclusion. As fate would have it, some time after that my brother would mention to my mom that he felt as if she had unrealistic expectations of him. I was able to tell him right then and there, that the only reason my parents pushed him was because they knew that he was more than capable of achieving his goals. Of course, I was simply expressing my own feelings on the matter. I will continue to watch as he grows. ",,,1,"I had multiple family members get COVID-19, some of whom were unable to obtain good health care as they lived in underserved communities. Being unable to visit nearby family and to not physically be there for them when they were sick or hurt was a very isolating and saddening feeling. I read of many businesses shutting down because they could not survive the lockdown. I was fortunate enough that around the start of the pandemic I had begun my job as an EMT which allowed me to continue to earn money as well as patient care experience. During the pandemic, it was very difficult for me to obtain volunteering opportunities. I contacted hospitals, searched online, and reached out to fire and police departments hoping to do a ride along; but, none were able to offer an opportunity for a student to participate in. Access to letters of recommendation was also difficult as establishing meaningful relationships with professors was a challenge in an online learning platform.",1,0,0
2023,15456656,,27,Man,IRQ,1,EO1,1,1,"I was born in Iraq seven years before the Iraqi-Freedom war during the rule of the dictator Sadam Hussein who killed several of my family members due to our minority religious affiliation and forced us to leave our hometown. Years after the war, terrorist groups controlled major cities, leading to inhumane conditions for my family, so we fled to the United Nations refugee camps. We were granted a special immigration visa to come to the U.S. after terrorist groups targeted us due to my family's work with the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Being a refugee meant more than just a title for me; it meant starting a new life and leaving everything behind. In 2016, we arrived in the U.S., and I was 19 years old. At the time, we came with only 1000 dollars to keep us on our feet, so I worked full-time to provide for my family, and I withheld my education temporarily. I was able to build my credit and move my family out of our friend's home, all while saving money to pursue my dream of higher education.

I saw his eyes staring at my brother, Rusul, next to me. I knew these colors represent two religious affiliations, and if I answered incorrectly, the consequences would be fatal. I observed their clothing that accumulated dust, probably while crossing the desert west of Baghdad, through which I recognized their affiliation. I nervously said, “What were the colors?” and he laughed. Luckily, due to our young age, Rusul and I were let go, but as they were preparing to move on, they shot an innocent civilian and left him to die. When Rusul and I took the wounded civilian to the hospital, there was only one physician who was left to assist a growing number of victims. I was frustrated to see victims filling hallways with no chance to be seen, and the physician-to-patient ratio triggered me to take action. I learned how to perform first-aid procedures by reading first-aid and gross anatomy textbooks after teaching myself English, and my frustration turned into motivation to continue learning.  

One night when my cousin and I were shopping in our local market, I could feel the ground under me begin to tremble after a force threw me on my back. In the silence after the explosion, I got up searching for my cousin. I found him slightly injured, so I helped control his bleeding. I heard my neighbor, Morad, in his piercing scream shout, “Get out! They are burning down the city!” Supplies were depleted, and the adrenaline pumped my racing heart to run to the nearest residential area. I knew that responders would take hours to arrive, and I could not bear the idea of letting others bleed while waiting hours for help. So I went door-to-door, asking for any first aid kits people would spare. I returned and applied what I learned to help Morad and others whose injuries I could reasonably manage. Despite my efforts and those of others, some did not make it. Taking away the pain of survivors and increasing their chances to live after experiencing hard circumstances ignited my heart and fueled my desire to pursue medicine.

After leaving Iraq and relocating to California, while I was volunteering at our local hospital, Rusul was brought to the emergency room experiencing an aneurysm. Unfortunately, there was no available neurosurgeon, and he needed to be transferred. By that time, doctors had lost hope. As my parents and our doctors were holding hands, tears filled their eyes when I translated for them what the doctors meant by “Brain dead.”It was shocking to me to realize that even with some of the best technology in the world, living in an underserved community jeopardized Rusul’s chance to survive. I also saw the need to innovate new approaches to treatment that could enhance outcomes and stabilize patients, especially if immediate care is not possible. I knew that training to be a  physician would allow me to explore different treatment approaches and one day determine how best to improve patient outcomes. 

As the COVID-19 pandemic raged on, the City of Hope Cancer Center stopped allowing visitors to accompany patients. I knew the importance of having a support system after my brother’s death, so I was compelled to volunteer and serve as a liaison between patients and their families. ""Lily"" who only spoke Arabic, once told me that she felt embarrassed to ask for help carrying the spoon and that she could not eat on her own. Every time I helped her eat, she would laugh as I held the spoon, waiting for the hot food to get colder, and she would say, “You didn’t do the chew-chew train.” While it was a very rewarding experience, I wanted to provide Lily with the care that relieves her symptoms and allows her to carry the spoon on her own. After I taught Lily essential words in English to break the language barrier, I saw her positive demeanor change when she knitted hats for everyone. The barrier was broken, and she was more comfortable continuing to seek treatment, showing me that healing the body without healing the soul is incomplete healing. 

It does not matter what side of the globe you are on, facing terrorism or a life-threatening disease; there is always a need for someone who can act quickly and critically to provide treatment while compassionately healing the soul. The aneurysm that took my brother away and the challenges associated with treating such cases highlighted many opportunities for improvement. My interactions at City of Hope taught me the importance of individualizing our health care and breaking the barrier between patients and physicians. I was born during a war, and the first memory of my life is in an underground shelter waiting to get out. I knew that when I got out, I would have to fight. Therefore, I will fight through medicine to lift the spirits of patients after chaos consumes them. I will learn and fight to develop strategies to efficiently treat patients in underserved communities and ensure they will get the chance for quality, holistic care. I will fight for a model of medicine that incorporates social justice and equal access to healthcare. For that, I will become a physician.","While volunteering at City of Hope, many of our patients receive treatment for many terminal diseases such as cancer. On one of my shifts, I noticed that the same woman was sitting and praying before her appointment. When I offered her a coffee, she shared with me that she is accustomed to praying with her daughter before she sees her doctor in hopes that she will hear good news about her health progress. Since the pandemic forced many facilities to enforce a strict no-visitors policy, I told her that I would be more than happy to pray with her so she would not be alone. Although I did not share the same religion as her, I saw the importance that spirituality and faith can have on the healing of a person. As a future physician, I hope to provide my support to patients by respecting their faith during challenging times and advocating for their right to practice their spiritual beliefs to provide the best treatment plan possible.","Through working at JDO Mediterranean Inc., I witnessed food insecurity that is faced by individuals in my community. The numbers were shocking, and I realized it was impossible to alleviate the problem without collective efforts, so I advocated for this issue with other local businesses, and I arranged weekly meetings to discuss how to combat food insecurity in our local community. At first, multiple businesses rejected my proposal, so we had to continue alone for some time. When they witnessed our impacts, a few businesses decided to contribute to our efforts. Later on, we started distributing free meals. This experience taught me the impact of working hard to be successful and to learn from my experiences. Through collaboration and advocacy, we can make a larger impact on our community. In being persistent in similar situations, I can learn to overcome barriers I may face and develop solutions to achieve my goals.",,,1,"Our lab‚Äôs review paper was delayed due to the inability to collect data during the pandemic, so I volunteered at our community hospital. Observing how tirelessly healthcare providers attended to the growing number of patients and treated each one with individualized and compassionate care inspired me to continue my pursuit of medicine. At this time, my brother was rushed to the ER for a brain aneurysm, later losing his life indirectly due to staff shortages and long ambulance arrival times. I rescheduled my MCAT and took a gap year to support my family financially and emotionally throughout our grieving process. Witnessing the toll that healthcare facilities faced and supporting my family, I saw how valuable it is to have support from loved ones during these circumstances. My experiences during the pandemic fueled my desire to continue volunteering and supporting patients and their families in times of need.",1,1,2

We were about 3 minutes away from reaching our house when she suddenly began screaming in pain and clenching her stomach. Scared and confused, I asked her what was going on. With her hands tightly clutching onto her stomach, she asked me to steer the car instead. I immediately complied and she switched between the gas and brake pedals as I directed us onward. After miraculously making it home, my family rushed her to the Emergency Room. She squeezed my hand tightly the entire ride there. Once inside the ER, a doctor came in to tell us she had gallstones. After noticing the shock and devastation that formed on our faces, the doctor reassured us that my mom would be okay. I thought to myself, ""How can he so calmly and confidently tell us that she will be okay when I just witnessed her in such excruciating pain?"". Even though this question remained in my head, the way he comforted us made me feel obliged to trust his words. As he predicted, my mom underwent a successful Cholecystectomy that permanently relieved her of Gallstones. As traumatic an experience as this was, it made me feel good that I was able to be there for my mom in a time when she needed someone most. From making sure we got home safely to giving her a sense of belonging by holding her hand, I felt content about how I handled this situation. The doctor's reassurance and successful procedure made me sincerely appreciate the service physicians provide, which ultimately sparked my interest in the field of medicine.  
 
After this experience, I wanted to learn more about what it means to work in the medical field, so I began volunteering in the same Emergency Department where my mom was diagnosed with gallstones. From restocking IV carts to making sure patients had clean blankets and socks, there was always a sense of responsibility that I felt every time I stepped into this environment. The dynamic environment of the ED made me realize the importance of consistent communication and teamwork. Every person had a unique role to fulfill which could not be done without the input and instructions provided from person to person. I felt constantly busy making sure both nurses and physicians had the proper medical supplies to optimally treat the patient, which was only possible by maintaining communication with the medical professionals and my fellow volunteers. Feeling part of the team and being able to make patients feel secure was a great feeling which further stimulated my curiosity in medicine. 

Volunteering in the ED gave me a sense of the workflow that medical professionals have on a day to day basis, however, I was eager to learn more about physician patient interactions. This led me to begin shadowing doctors at both outpatient clinics and hospitals. In addition to attentively listening to the conversations between patients and providers, I was able to gain more and more responsibilities over time, first checking vitals, then scribing, and even seeing patients on my own to collect a thorough review of systems. This allowed me to converse with the patients and learn more about their medical concerns. 

During these patient rounds, I encountered an elderly patient diagnosed with dysthymia. He explained to me how he is a retired surgeon with no one but his caregiver to look after him. He had recently gone on vacation and informed me that he experienced random onsets of depressive symptoms, which made him feel helpless and vulnerable. This being my first encounter with a patient suffering from depression, all I could think of was what I could do to make him feel comfortable and content in my presence. We found a mutual interest in our favorite sports, particularly basketball, which led to a long and memorable conversation. As he was leaving, he shook my hand and said ""thank you"" with a particular look of appreciation on his face. In that moment, I realized that while I could not directly address his symptoms or give him any advice regarding his mental health, our friendly conversation was something he desperately needed. Clinical experiences like these not only broadened my knowledge in the medical field, but affirmed my goal of becoming a physician who through active listening and compassion is able to make a difference in patient’s lives.

Through the experience with my mom and her gallstones, I learned the importance of having someone support you during your most difficult moments and reassure you that things will be okay. My experience in the ED taught me the significance of teamwork in a medical environment and what its success can do for patient well-being. Through shadowing and scribing, my knowledge of medicine grew exponentially and the power of active listening taught me what it really means to be a provider that can impact their patient through their expertise and communication. Indeed, knowledge of science and medicine is a major component of being a physician, but showing compassion, empathy, and genuine care are just as crucial. People are not just beings who can be defined by a chart or characterized in a report, but rather unique humans with their own circumstances that deserve a provider who makes them feel comfortable.","My high school hosted special olympics for disadvantaged kids which ""Alex"", a kid in my gym class was a part of. He was always isolated and watched from the sidelines as we played basketball. Knowing that he would be participating in basketball at special olympics, I approached him and asked him to shoot around with me. Due to his down syndrome, it was difficult for me to communicate with him so I passed him the ball and demonstrated how to shoot. The next day, he came up to me with a big smile on his face making the same shooting motion implying that he wanted to shoot around again. Spending every gym period with Alex made it easier for me to communicate with him overtime, and I noticed his confidence and comfort around me exponentially increased. I started looking forward to gym class because of the positive energy he would bring every day, and I realized that all it took to spark our friendship was a friendly approach between two individuals who didn't let social barriers intervene.","Located in Chicago, Masjid-Al-Fatir is a place of worship which gets minimal donations compared to other mosques in the Chicago area. Due to their lack of funds, it was difficult for them to hire a prayer leader and organize prayers during the month of Ramadan. Due to my experience as a youth leader in my mosque and ability to lead prayer, I was able to reach out to them and volunteer as a prayer leader without payment. Grateful for the opportunity, I advertised Masjid-Al-Fatir at my local mosque to urge people to contribute to donations and volunteer for prayer organization during this month. Overtime, the number of people attending prayers at Masjid-Al-Fatir gradually increased to the point where I was able to lead prayers at this mosque for consecutive Ramadans in a row. I developed a strong bond with the community there and continue to involve myself however I can every Ramadan. My goal is to bring this mindset to RMU and contribute to aiding underserved areas of Chicago. ",,,1,"The pandemic both positively and negatively affected my journey to medical school. Using my part time income to pay for the remainder of my college tuition after FAFSA was difficult following my unemployment due to the pandemic. My only option was to use my dad's unemployment benefits which were primarily used to pay for our household bills. I was also looking to seek research experience following my transfer to UIC which was difficult due to many opportunities being closed due to the ongoing pandemic. Desperately seeking employment, I was inspired by our frontline healthcare workers and the sacrifices they made for their communities during this crisis. I decided that if I was to work it had to include aiding people through this pandemic which is why I started working as a medical assistant/lab technician whose primary job was to work with potential Covid-19 infectious patients. Because of the pandemic, I was able to gain more clinical experience and assist people through this crisis.",1,0,2

My Spanish father would slice our aloe vera plant to release its cool, sticky sap onto the cuts on my skin after a fall instead of giving me a band-aid. Early memories of my parents cutting their chalky blood pressure pills in half to prolong the prescription are still clear in my mind. As a child, my concept of health and disease was shaped by two non-traditional, anti-science parents. I was not allowed to be vaccinated against HPV or ever finish a full dose of antibiotics. I grew up in a household that was deeply skeptical of modern medicine, and seeing the impact this had on my parents’ lives has made it my mission in life to change that sentiment.
 
At the start of my undergraduate career, I began volunteering at a medical clinic for the underserved to better understand my upbringing and the disparities that were present in the local community. Many clinic patients had stories of abuse that, in addition to their decreased health literacy, left them feeling vulnerable when seeking help. A formative encounter was observing a physician explain high cholesterol to a patient. After finding out that he worked in appliance repair, the physician told him to visualize the condition as if a drain was being clogged. The patient visibly relaxed and smiled, saying “what can I do to unclog it!” The physician laughed and proceeded to talk about the recommendations, building a common framework to achieve their goal together. Watching this relationship form, I admired how he patiently took the time to understand the patient’s perspective. I value the skill of transforming complex medical knowledge into a tool that prioritizes patient success and comprehension to improve adherence. I am devoted to using the investigative nature of medicine alongside education to include patients in the conversation about their health.


After seeing the impact that a physician’s approach has, I became dedicated to providing not only myself and my parents but also my community with evidence-based information to improve their quality of life. When patients confide in me about traumatic experiences, I strive to make them feel heard and dignified. “Jan”, a clinic patient that became very close to me, suffered from domestic violence for years. She cried about her 300-pound body and said that there were no options other than prayer to improve her condition. Each week we worked on breaking down nutritional labels and talked about ways to make better food choices to alleviate her swollen ankles. She was not alone as I told her I previously dealt with overeating during emotional times. From our connection, I noticed she became more open when we spent time together. In the span of several months, she lost weight and developed greater confidence to speak up about her health concerns. I found that empowering others to be their own advocates while making science accessible has become an answer I once sought out when first leaving home. 


During my four years of exploring evidence-based care, I was able to receive my HPV vaccine and have fruitful conversations with my parents about what my experiences in the medical field have yielded. My appreciation for education has led them to make strides in supporting my journey as well as their own. Now, my mother sends me medical articles while my father loves the Institute of Human Anatomy Youtube channel. After working with Jan, I showed my parents the same nutrition techniques. My mother started plating her arroz con gandules in measured portions, which has helped my father lead a more active lifestyle. Through my persistence in sharing the importance of health information, they have found a space to enjoy the art of medicine alongside their non-empirical beliefs. The impact that health education had on my family helps fuel my passion to become a physician who dedicates time for patients to develop a deep understanding of how behavior affects wellbeing. 


I am inspired to be a physician who provides care for patients by working with their perspectives of disease instead of against them. It is crucial to show patients how to conceptualize their health in a way that is relevant to their lives and experiences. When caring for Jan and all the clinic visitors, I see reflections of my mother and father. I started my journey to medicine trying to help my parents learn to trust in science and in the midst of that, I saw my passion in doing the same for others. My mom still delivers the same oil ritual when she sees me, but I now close my eyes and partake with her. I understand that her actions are out of love and compassion. The realization is clear; it is with this same compassion in my heart that I wish to grow with my patients in the future. As I continue to advance my scientific proficiency in a future medical program, I will motivate my patients to be active leaders in their health decisions because the answers I once sought out became personal experiences that inspire me to be a dedicated, humanistic physician.","As a public health undergraduate, I had the opportunity to participate in a Virtual Exchange Program with medical students from Egypt. While creating our project on disaster preparedness, ‚ÄúMaha‚Äù repeatedly apologized for her English to which I encouraged that her voice was valued in our discussion. Over time she opened up, sending us pictures of her kushari or fish with sayada rice over text. I made efforts to strengthen our connection by learning greetings in Arabic or understanding time zones before suggesting when to meet. This program positively impacted my openness about diverse approaches to problem-solving, crucial in an interdisciplinary medical setting. I actively understand that my future peers and patients will have different perspectives because of their unique lived experiences. I am ready to challenge my ways of thinking and build common ground as a team to achieve a goal. Driven to expand my cultural competency, I will uplift those different from myself at Rush.","As a Cancer Center Intern, my work focused on increasing access to cancer screenings and vaccine uptake in our community. During cervical cancer screening day, I took a phone call with ‚ÄúCarla‚Äù, a single mother with no transportation to receive her pap smear. I spoke to her on the phone in Spanish and reassured her we had organized an Uber to get her the care she deserved. That day I was reached 50 women in the community. As a witness to many families like Carla with lack of access to care, I understand that health is influenced by many factors. Motivated to help others in the same shoes, my team utilized a mobile bus for health check-ups outside neighborhoods. The bus eliminated barriers such as transportation and parking costs. As a future physician, I will address social determinants of health and work with the needs of my patients and greater community to support their goals. I hope to meet patients where they are and equip them with resources to reduce the disparities they face.",,,1,"During the pandemic, I came home for several months to protect my father who was at high risk due to being in his seventies. The initial feelings of shock were replaced by an active desire to help and use education as a tool to alleviate others‚Äô anxiety from the overwhelming flood of information. As a public health major, I was presented with an opportunity to educate myself about the pandemic through an online course that analyzed the historic, social, medical, and artistic influences of previous pandemics and COVID-19. I used this knowledge to help my close and extended family in Spain and Puerto Rico better grasp the situation. I was able to witness how education played a significant role in reducing stress among individuals who were not familiar with interpreting medical information. These moments further solidified my passion to become a physician that focuses on health education, literacy, and delivering care for patients in a meaningful context.",1,0,3

We wound our way into the depths of the dorm, which felt dark, even under the harsh fluorescent lighting. I took a deep breath and turned the corner. I saw two police officers standing on either side of a student, applying pressure to his wrists. He was sitting in a chair with his head slumped over in despair. I know him. “Sam” had been at my house the week before laughing and watching movies with our friends. My stomach sank, I didn’t even know he had depression. As we tended to his injuries Sam mentioned that this should have all been “fixed” by now. He shared that he just started a new medication for depression, but it wasn’t working, and he felt hopeless. On our way to the hospital, the lead clinician explained how these medications can take a while to work and what other resources could help him alongside those medications.
I really admired the way the clinicians on that call took the time to share their knowledge with Sam. The misunderstanding of his own diagnosis and a timeline for treatment could have ended his life. Looking back, Sam and other patients like him, solidified my passion for healthcare and patient advocacy. As I became a team leader, I pushed myself and those around me to focus more heavily on all mental health-related calls from panic attacks to the more extreme. I made sure patients knew they had all of our focus and time so we could build trust and get them the resources or the education they needed.
That night also showed me that there are more important changes that need to be made to help first responders cope with the emotions that come with witnessing trauma. While this is not unique to EMS, I knew I could make meaningful changes in the way my squad handled these calls. I made a commitment to myself to create an atmosphere that encouraged all of us to talk about our feelings with each other or an appropriate resource. My hope is that a culture change would not only help us to better support our patients but the health of our clinicians and the longevity of their careers in the medical field. I made sure my crews were familiar with our local mental health resources for themselves and their patients. We debriefed every call, especially the tough calls, and I made sure they knew they could talk to me if they needed help. My goal was to make sure that every person I trained learned to lean on each other and their resources so we could intervene early for each other and our patients.
As a team leader, I responded to a call for difficulty breathing. I found the patient, “Jen”, sitting on the floor gasping for air. Her fists were balled up and her eyes nervously scanned the ground in a panic. I cleared the room so only myself, the patient, and some equipment remained. I sat on the ground across from the patient and talked her through some breathing techniques to calm her down. After a few minutes, Jen was able to tell me a bit about what happened. She shared how overwhelming her year had been and her concern that asking for help would damage her career prospects. I shared with her my concerns if she choose not to seek treatment, especially after she indicated that her more recent thoughts had started to scare her. Jen agreed to come with us for an evaluation once I reassured her that we could help her and that she was not wasting our time. This is one of the few times I feel like I got the opportunity to help someone in a preventative way and I credit my experiences with patients like Sam for pushing me to train harder for these calls.
At the start of 2021, I decided to leave my lab job to pursue a career in medicine. Going to medical school wasn’t part of my plan, but during my first job out of college working in a lab, I spent many long hours reflecting on my life. I found that most of all, I looked forward to my 14 hours of EMS duty a week, where I got to focus on patient care. The passion I had for research hadn’t changed, however, I craved more integration of my research with patient care. I spent a lot of time thinking about Sam and how much more I could do for him with more experience, education, and training. My decision to go into medicine was exciting and daunting, but once I reflected on how I really wanted to spend my career, I realized that I wanted to focus on developing relationships with patients and creating care plans to improve their lives.
Treating patients and training new clinicians is where I’ve found my niche, and I’ve realized I would like to do more of both. My time in EMS was filled with seeking out training opportunities to better myself and increase my scope of practice, but I still have more to learn. I want to build a career that allows me to empower my patients through education about their health and to share my passion with the generations of clinicians who follow me. More than anything, I want to spend my life doing work that I’m proud of, solving problems I care about. Being a physician would allow me to continue to explore all of the issues I am passionate about now, but with the tools, knowledge, and experience to be able to make a wider, longer-lasting impact on the lives of my patients.","I come from a non-traditional blended family with siblings and extended family representing multiple races and ethnicities. Even among my siblings, we represent several races and ethnicities, share different combinations of parents, and were raised in vastly different environments and economic circumstances. I grew up in a multi-generational home with parents that were always there to help people in need._x000D_
Surrounded by people who have different beliefs and experiences, I learned the importance of being inclusive and supportive of others; that there are barriers to opportunities that have nothing to do with individual merit or potential; and that by being an advocate and an ally you can change lives. These are the values I live by._x000D_
Having such a positive, richly diverse family experience has sparked in me a love for meeting new people who come from different backgrounds and places. I look forward to continuing to expand my worldview through the lenses of Chicago‚Äôs diverse population.","When I joined Virginia Tech Rescue Squad there was a mindset surrounding training where the trainee should prove themselves over and over until they are deemed worthy of the role. Additionally, despite our 40-person squad having nearly 70% female membership, only two were cleared as team leads. As I went through my own clearance process to become a team leader, I considered what changes might make our process more inclusive so we could clear more diverse and better team leaders._x000D_
Once it was my turn to step into the role of training the next generation of team leaders I set clear intentions to tailor each person‚Äôs training process to their specific needs. I saw every new member as capable of taking on any role they desired, and my role as the trainer was to help them find the right combination of tools to get there. With time, I taught others to view the training process the same way and our team leaders became a stronger and more diverse group in gender representation and personality.",,,1,"My volunteer work as an EMT during the Covid pandemic compelled me to work towards applying to medical school, a year after graduation. Because of this, I have fewer recommendation letters and less shadowing experiences than I would like to have at this point. Per the policy at my university, I am no longer eligible for a committee letter due to the amount of time that has passed since I graduated. Additionally, I no longer have relationships with any faculty members from whom I could have requested a letter. I do have letters from people who are intimately familiar with my passions, clinical experiences, and journey in medicine. Finally, while I have completed some in-person shadowing, I was not able to start until May and was only able to shadow one specialty in person. This did not give me the time necessary to establish a strong enough relationship with the physician to get a recommendation letter. I am seeking out more diverse shadowing experiences before entering medical school.",1,0,1

I assure Eve I will be back and run toward “Ann”. I enter her apartment with a smile and ask if she needs help. She returns my politeness with a soft smile, but I see worry in her eyes. She grabs my hand and asks where her husband is. I say that her daughter will be in this afternoon. She lights up for a moment, but then asks if her husband will be in too. I tell her I am not sure, but point to a picture of him on the wall and ask if that handsome man is hers. The worry fades as she shares about her fifty year marriage. As I fix her pillow, cover her feet with a blanket, and listen to her recall her journey of love, I wonder where I will be when I am 93 years old. I hope I will be as eager to recall my happiness as she is, but as my dad always says, “hope is not a tactic; where you end up is a result of the choices you make and the goals you set.”

As a child, I was fascinated by learning and enjoyed challenging myself. In high school, this manifested into the goal of attending The University of Michigan. After reaching it, I realized that in setting my next goal, I would be making a decision for my future career. My love for science drew me towards the medical field.

Working in Dr. Corfas’ research lab facilitated a real world connection to the textbook science that fascinates me. I took part in the problem solving and discovery that occurs in research. I explored how experiments present real data in need of analysis. Mouse brain dissection, sectioning with a cryostat, immunofluorescent staining, and microscope analysis took precision, interpretation, relearning, adjusting, and complex thought about why results occurred. Research took me outside of the classroom and scratched my knowledge-seeking itch in a new way. I grew through this experience and ultimately realized that science, analysis, and continued discovery is what excites and drives me.
 
Along with my passion for science, I have a desire to care for others. This has manifested itself in an outreach with children including being a family nanny, volunteering at preschools, being a penpal, and helping children in a classroom setting. Encouraging children to find their passion, to express their feelings, and to be curious is a huge joy in my life. Watching Natalie’s cheer routine, helping Priscilla learn the word ‘bioluminescence’, or writing to Janelle about my lab experiments all make a difference in not only the child’s life, but in mine too. Through these experiences, I have realized how understanding another person’s emotions is essential in building trust and creating healthy relationships. Furthermore, my involvement in classroom settings has exercised the passion I have for sharing knowledge and finding ways to explain new information to others.

Knowing that caring for children excited me, I sought to discover if patient care excited me too. To this point, I had only cared for healthy children, but care offered by a medical doctor would be very different. I explored this by becoming a certified nurse aide. Working as a caregiver at a senior living facility revealed that my passion for care was not solely for healthy children. Seeing the difference I could make in not only a resident’s life, but the impact care and kindness can have on a whole family has been life changing. Giving someone a smile and caring touch while explaining what is happening, how I can help, and asking what they need from me is something I am proud to do on a daily basis with my residents. I have supported residents as they decline and join the hospice community with a priority on comfort care. Offering a family reassurance that their loved one is well taken care of when they can’t be with them and explaining what care is given takes a little weight off their shoulders. As a caregiver, I take some burden away, and I will continue to do so as a medical doctor. The patience and resilience I have gained from working with the elderly community has helped me grow as a human being, and the experience has helped me discover that science is not the only part that excites me about a career in the medical field; it is the patients and families that I am able to care for as well.

Becoming a medical doctor will allow me to continue studying science with the promise of continuous learning and the opportunity to show compassion, patience, and kindness. I am excited for a career as a medical doctor bringing my love for scientific application, biological processes, problem solving, learning, and teaching together with my passion for care. When I am 93, I want to look back on my life in awe of how I lived with compassion, curiosity, and discovery. I want to recall a career that allowed me to explore modern science and the wonders of the human body. I want to recall a career that allowed me to take the burdens of countless families. I want to recall the opportunities for teaching the science of the body that amazes me to those in need of a simple explanation. I want to recall that applying to medical school led to the greatest adventure of my life because it opened the door to a career igniting all my passions.","At my job, I am of the minority race.

Jaldi aao! Come here!” my dad exclaimed, dropping his work bag off at the door and motioning for us to join him on the couch. My dad, his excitement getting the better of him, immediately jumped into a story about an interesting patient he’d encountered at the hospital that day. My sister, never one to be all that interested in his stories, was already grumbling under her breath. Meanwhile, I was impatiently waiting to ask all the questions I had for him. “Wait, Abu, what’s a CAT scan? Are you scanning actual cats at work?” This was a regular routine throughout my childhood. Looking back, I’m not entirely sure what was so fascinating to me about his stories. What I didn’t realize, though, was that by encouraging me to ask my questions he was also instilling in me a sense of curiosity about the world around me and an appreciation for what the field of medicine is capable of. 

Not only did my family help me develop a sense of curiosity from an early age, they also instilled in me an appreciation for diversity and a culturally conscious approach to life. My family is nomadic. Originally from Pakistan, we first moved from city to city in the United States. Eventually, we made our way to the Middle East. After moving to Saudi Arabia, my initial reaction was “Wow, things work differently over here.” On the daily bus ride to school, it was hard not to notice the swarms of migrant laborers working in the scorching desert heat of Riyadh. I began to wonder what life for these individuals looks like and how a country as wealthy as Saudi Arabia still has such large wealth disparities. Upon moving to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates I decided to join (and eventually lead) human rights advocacy efforts at my high school. We worked hard to organize visitations to the labor camps themselves. This proved extremely difficult, in large part due to the city’s interest in concealing certain human rights violations. The visitations revealed the extent of those violations and the hidden living conditions of the workers; eight workers confined to one room, beds close enough to hear the sound of one another’s heartbeats. A common thread that ran through our conversations with these workers was their lack of access to quality water, sanitary products, and healthcare. Everyone has a right to these necessities and the stress of trying to meet their basic needs was not something they deserved.

Entering college, my goals were twofold. One, I wanted to learn more about medicine and figure out if it was something I wanted to make a career out of. Two, I wanted to continue learning about marginalized groups and the disparities they face. Alongside required courses, I also took courses on incarceration and the history of Muslims in the United States. Subsequently, my interest in social justice reform grew. I joined REDACT, an organization that supports incarcerated Muslims. As I dove into what social justice work looks like, I briefly considered alternative career paths. I was questioning pursuing medicine because I didn’t know if it would allow me the opportunity to continue my involvement in these reform efforts. However, I quickly realized that there is also work to be done in the medical field regarding social justice. Racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates, lack of continuity of care during post-incarceration, and general cultural insensitivity in medical treatment are just a few issues that are important to me. I eventually learned to combine my interests in healthcare and inequalities more organically, writing my honors thesis on COVID-19 vaccine equity in incarcerated racial and ethnic minorities. Because I am invested in learning about healthcare inequality in general, as well as my own biases, I hope that I can be in a position to make an impact as a globally raised Pakistani-American Muslim.

While research experience gave me a group-level understanding of what socio-cultural influences on healthcare can look like, a visit to my primary physician gave me a glimpse of what it looks like on an individual level. What I thought was going to be a simple routine visit turned out to bring upsetting news. My physician told me that she suggested, from a medical standpoint, that I abstain from fasting during the approaching Islamic month of Ramadan due to new health concerns. However, fasting is one of the most important aspects of my faith system, and not fasting would impose a great spiritual toll on me. Therefore, through shared decision-making, we concluded that I would fast given that we take other precautionary measures. I respected the due diligence she took to understand what fasting meant for me. Like her, I hope to not only support those of my own identities, but also appreciate the circumstances of other races, ethnicities, religions, etc.

So, why medicine? By going into this career, I hope to continue to learn about ways to advance equity in medicine while practicing socially conscious care to enhance patient outcomes.

These days, it isn’t my dad who is calling my sister and I to tell us about his work day. Instead, it is me who is hijacking the family WhatsApp group to share the latest advances in medicine and social justice reform through medical practice. Oh, how the tables have turned.","When my family announced that we would be moving to Saudi Arabia from Minnesota at the age of 13, I was nothing but outraged. I pondered why women were obligated to wear abayas‚Äô (loose clothes worn by Muslim women). However, I quickly realized that the adjustments made in Saudi Arabia were no different than the assimilation we unconsciously did while living in the small town of Sartell, Minnesota. _x000D_
_x000D_
Moving abroad, I became more secure with my identity as a Third-Culture Pakistani-American over time. Instead of succumbing to the norms of those around me, I learned how to tolerate and accept others‚Äô differences without compromising my own identity. I was able to have an appreciation for lived experiences different than my own. This was especially important attending international schools in the Middle East. My high school hauled students from every corner of the world. I became more open-minded and understanding as a result of being surrounded by other ‚ÄúThird-Culture Kids.‚Äù ","Understanding mass incarceration as a threat to marginalized communities is a phenomenon that is important to me. Knowing how faith has the ability to be a pervasive protective health behavior in my own community, I focused my final project in the seminar I took called ‚ÄúMass Incarceration and Public Health‚Äù on the role of religion in incarcerated populations. Given a lack of services for incarcerated Muslims in Minnesota and the high demand for this, I and other community organizers decided to spearhead ‚ÄúREDACT,‚Äù a community organization supporting incarcerated Muslims through re-entry, letter writing, and mutual aid. We have been connecting incarcerated Muslims and their loved ones with the services they seek. _x000D_

Although rewarding, this has been incredibly challenging work. I believe that social justice reform work is a life-long commitment. As a physician, I plan to continue addressing this systemic inequality on a patient and policy level. _x000D_

The pandemic highlighted existing health disparities between US socioeconomic groups. As a result, I became more determined to address these disparities.

2023,15461947,,25,Woman,USA,1,EO1,0,1,"I grew up in a low-income household where my mom worked multiple jobs to provide for us. When I was 12, I had an emergency appendectomy; we did not have health insurance, so this financial burden led to eventual bankruptcy and a near foreclosure on our home. To avoid this, my mother took up another job cleaning on the weekends and I would go with her to help maximize the number of houses we could do a day. In high school, I had a part time job after school and continued to clean with my mother. Because I balanced it well, I assumed it would be fine in college as well. While in college, I had a full-time job to pay for university and I worked on the weekends with my mother, as well. Initially this was difficult, but manageable; however, in my second year I did not have enough money to pay for tuition and had to sell my car. In turn, this made going back home to clean much more time consuming and my grades definitely suffered as I was not studying enough. Luckily, I found a new job that paid more and became a resident advisor. Together, this provided enough income for me to send money to my mother, rather than going to clean. Although there were long and hard days, I can say that regardless of the circumstances, I have and will continue to work hard to achieve my goals.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,5301,1420.0,,136.0,2000.0,105.0,1,136,1,2105,04/08/2022,Tulane University,Foreign Language,0,,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Less than $25,000",3,1,1,1,77.0,20.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,15,Adequate,2,2023,4,6.0,1.0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"A 52. That was the grade on my first university calculus exam. “I…I failed. There is no way I can get into medical school now”. The tears in my eyes blur the numbers as I try and call my mother. “Well, Zaidmara”, she responds, “should I go pick you up then, bring you home, and you can come and clean with me”. I know she is half serious, so I respond, “No, I am not ready. I can’t give up yet”. It would be a lie to say that things got easier - I was both working and in school full time. I am however determined to persevere and go to medical school; I am willing to work as hard as I need to do so.  
  
Although I have always wanted to become a physician, I have had other interests along the way - I am a French major after all. But I have always looked at these varying skills and interests and thought about their applications to medicine, such as the positive impacts of being multilingual on patient care. The ability to communicate with others has been important throughout my life; I grew up translating for my family. With my grandmother having type II diabetes, it was imperative for me to accompany her to her appointments to translate, so she could care for herself and keep her diabetes under control. Recently, however, she found a Spanish-speaking physician, and I have seen a significant increase in her confidence when she goes to her appointments. As a result of being able to communicate more clearly, it is now easier for her to manage her diabetes, and her health has improved as a result. As someone who is multilingual and aspires to be a physician, seeing the outcome of effective patient communication pushes me to work even harder to achieve my goals in medicine.  
 
During my time working in the emergency department, I witnessed how medicine is not only about diagnosing and treating patients, but also serving as a resource for and teaching patients. After a patient’s results indicated that she was having a miscarriage, the physician asked me to translate for the patient. As it was my first time delivering such emotional news to a patient, I discussed possible reactions with the physician prior to entering the room, but I was not prepared for her response. As I delivered the news to her that she had a miscarriage, “tuviste un aborto espontáneo”, her eyes just remained blank. “Perdón no entendí” (Sorry, I don’t understand). After discussing with her and asking a few questions, I realized she did not fully understand what a miscarriage was. I took the time and clarified for her, emphasizing that it was not her fault. Although she had just been given difficult news, she thanked me for explaining and said that she was comforted now understanding what was happening. In this moment, I realized just how important it is for physicians to take the time and educate patients about their diagnoses because it can provide relief. During my time as a teacher in France, I got a lot of practice in how to explain complex concepts. I often used comparisons and references that they would understand as middle schoolers. It was clear that when I “broke down” the lessons into more digestible parts, they were more receptive to what I had to say.

Communication is essential not only with patients, but with the entire medical team also. During my second training shift as a scribe, an elderly Spanish speaking patient was being wheeled into the trauma bay after a fall. Everyone began to look for someone who spoke Spanish and I whispered to my supervisor that I did. With nobody else in sight, I was given the go ahead and began translating all of the questions the physician was asking. “She says no pain, but she can’t feel anything on her right side.” The patient was immediately taken for a CT and found to be having a stroke. Because she was treated so quickly, she thankfully had a good outcome. In this moment I learned that medicine truly is a team effort, and that each person matters because they bring a set of skills unique to them, even the scribe still in training. 
 
I worked hard in college to manage my time and progressively do better in my science courses but working with patients I learned that there is so much more to medicine than just hard sciences. Patients deserve someone who is willing to work diligently and provide individualized care based on that patient’s needs. I want to be that physician. I want to be able to approach each case and incorporate my strengths into providing personalized care for my patients. As a first-generation student and Latina, I understand that there will be many more obstacles to overcome, and perhaps even more difficult than the ones I have already encountered; but I am eager to continue to work hard to provide that sense of being understood to patients.","As a Latina, growing up in a predominantly white community in Louisiana presented challenges. My culture and language at home was not the same at school, making it difficult to interact with my peers due to lack of similarities. As a result, I have developed the skills necessary to successfully interact with people with whom I share little to no connection. Furthermore, I have also cultivated a desire to learn more about other peoples and cultures in hopes of improving my communication and cultural awareness. During my gap year I chose to work internationally to simultaneously utilize the skills I had learned and gain new valuable competencies. Working in a priority education zone in rural France, I experienced initial culture shock; however, throughout my time there I adapted and had invaluable experiences. Given my combined life and academic experiences, I am uniquely able to empathize and connect with those of similar and drastically different backgrounds and life experiences.","Living and working in the New Orleans community, I am surrounded by people of different cultures and backgrounds. Unfortunately, the majority of healthcare professionals do not reflect this diversity. Working as a scribe, I have seen the effect this can have on patients and how small gestures can make a big difference. While at work, I served as a translator with Spanish and Portuguese speakers. Due to a lack of resources, there were not always translator phones available, leaving me as the only person who could communicate with the patients. I started out simply by translating but realized I could also teach the nurses and physicians common medical Spanish vocabulary for when I was not there. Many were appreciative and even took initiative to learn more independently. This experience and seeing the experiences of the patients significantly improve made me realize how small things can have big consequences, and how having someone who understands you can be everything.",,,1,"I initially planned to only take one gap year; however, after returning to university in the fall of 2020 I realized that would not be the case.

I realized I was exhausted and emotionally unwell and decided the best way to care for myself would be taking a second gap year. Following that decision, I had a job working for an NGO in Kenya lined up for my first gap year; due to the pandemic and travel restrictions, I was unable to go to Kenya. Instead, I found a job working as a teacher in a priority education zone in rural France.

Although it seems like a boring and dry gift for a high-schooler, I was thrilled. As someone who grew up with their nose constantly in a book, I pored over the encyclopedia in between homework assignments and tennis practices. From a young age, I was captivated by unanswered questions about our world. However, one field in particular captured my attention: the human body. Once I started learning about the various processes that keep us alive, from cellular respiration to cardiac contractions, my passion for biology and human physiology grew. As an undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), I aspired to learn about the cellular mechanisms responsible for diseases that I had not only heard of, but that also affected some of my family members. In a class called Human Physiology, I learned how understanding these mechanisms could allow physicians to treat their patients by using pharmacologic treatments to target specific receptors. I realized that by becoming a physician, I could use my passion for learning to diagnose and treat my own patients.
One of the first times I observed the application of scientific knowledge was when I began working as a medical scribe at an Emergency Department (ED), where I saw patients afflicted with the same diseases which I had learned about in my biology classes. One day, an 8-year-old boy with diabetes was brought in by his mother after he vomited multiple times. Through conducting various tests, the physician was able to determine that the patient was experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis. After he had been treated, I went to his room to talk to him and his mother. His mother grabbed my hand and expressed her relief at how much better her son looked compared to just hours prior. I hope that, in my endless pursuit of answering the unresolved questions about human physiology, I will be able to offer a similar respite to my own patients.
In the ED, I observed the humanistic side of medicine in addition to its scientific foundation. I recognized the importance of combining compassion and knowledge in practicing medicine. Our patients came from varied socioeconomic backgrounds and insurance statuses, but what they shared was their need for an empathetic doctor. As a medical scribe, I would often stay behind in patients’ rooms to ask more specific questions for their charts. However, this usually turned into a conversation that taught me about the type of physician I want to be: one who incorporates both a passion for learning and empathy to treat each patient as a whole.
Scribing not only introduced me to the practice of medicine, but it also challenged me to adapt to working in a busy hospital. As I saw how fast-paced the ED could be, I realized that in order to remain a dependable scribe for supervising physicians, I needed to take responsibility for my own familiarity with this novel environment. After my first few shifts, I read articles about common conditions, associated treatments, and other symptoms in order to accurately and informatively write charts for patients with these diseases. For example, I researched terms that would come up with patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), many of whom required ED visits for issues concerning their hemodialysis. By taking the time to familiarize myself with the typical dialysis regimens of CKD patients, I was able to ask more specific questions that helped my supervising physician make informed clinical decisions.
Hoping to broaden my clinical experience, I joined the Koegel Autism Center at UCSB as a Clinical Research Assistant (RA) as a sophomore. I worked with a team of other RAs and several post-doctoral students to implement a play-based intervention in toddlers with Autism Spectrum Disorder to expand their language capacities. Through bi-weekly sessions, I formed a true connection with the two toddlers I worked with, “M” and “K.” Initially, I was unsure whether I would be able to succeed in my therapy, as I had not previously worked with children in a research capacity. I realized that I needed to ask my team for help, especially when I encountered roadblocks in my progress with M and K. Although it was intimidating, I started to speak up more during our weekly team meetings to share my experiences and ask for advice. I made tweaks to my intervention based on my team members’ perspectives, which proved to be crucial to the toddlers’ language development. Compared to the beginning of my work with M and K, when they were limited to one- or two-word utterances, they were speaking in multi-word sentences and could draw from a wider vocabulary by the end of my time as an RA. Actively initiating discussions in team meetings taught me the value of different viewpoints, which allowed me to become a better clinician for M and K.
While I will always treasure the passages in my worn Encyclopedia Britannica, I found that my passion for learning stretches beyond the pages. I hope to implement my lessons in empathy, adaptability, and communication to become a physician who never stops exploring the unanswered questions in medicine.","In 2005, my parents, little brother, and I moved over 8,000 miles away from my hometown of Singapore to the San Francisco Bay Area. At the time, I was unaware of the magnitude of our move as I was only five years old. However, as I grow older and work towards my goal of attending medical school, I realize that my immigration and assimilation journey indefinitely shaped my values. My Singaporean accent was an immediate giveaway of my ‚Äúotherness,‚Äù something I wished to conceal. For several years, I was ashamed to be anything other than American-born. I was embarrassed by the color of my skin and my Singaporean pronunciation of certain words. It took several years before I felt proud of my immigrant status, but I will always remember the challenge of getting to that point. Through my medical education at Rush Medical College, I hope to use my experience struggling with my multicultural identity to appreciate and celebrate the diversity of the Chicago community.","When I helped found the Health & Equity Alliance at UC Santa Barbara, I knew that our mission of spreading awareness of and ameliorating public health issues had to start in our local community. I reached out to PATH, a homeless shelter in Santa Barbara. Along with a few club members, I volunteered at PATH every other weekend to prepare meals for their residents. Although it was a seemingly minor contribution, I formed connections with some of the residents and noticed their appreciation for a simple meal. It was deeply gratifying to make an enjoyable meal for them, but what was more rewarding were the relationships I formed. I talked with the residents about their families, friends, and favorite foods. At the end of our conversations, they expressed their gratitude for having someone to talk to. Spending a few hours of my weekend to bring a smile to the PATH residents‚Äô faces was a lesson in how such a small act of service could have an impact on an entire community.",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, I was a junior in college.

Immediately, I noticed that there were many people who suffered with and even died of COVID-19 but could not afford the care that could have saved their lives. With the suspension of free clinic services in Santa Barbara, the Emergency Department received people lacking shelter or a primary care physician who turned to our department for help. Unfortunately, they were often turned away or had to refuse care because of the cost of treatment.

As a new scribe, I tried to concentrate on the HPI but my eyes couldn’t leave the man lying on the stretcher in front of me. He arrived under the Baker’s Act, a Florida law allowing individuals who show harmful signs of mental disorders to be admitted for psychological evaluation. The patient was seemingly alone and had no family to contact. As the physician assessed him, the tears welling up in his eyes began to flow down his cheeks. His sobs overpowered his ability to answer any more questions. The physician consoled him, repeating “Everything will be okay,” and “We will take care of you.” As his sobs subsided, I witnessed the influence of the physician’s patience and empathy on the patient. Despite being in a room surrounded by strangers, the patient gained a support system of physicians and nurses who would care for him and provide mental health resources. This moment serves as a reminder for why I am drawn to medicine. I want to support patients in need and be able to offer them proper care and resources. Despite my nonlinear path to medicine, this feeling was the epitome of my pursuit. As a physician, I will be at the forefront of helping those in vulnerable positions.


My interest in medicine began in high school when I had the opportunity to serve as a patient care volunteer at a nearby hospital. I was drawn to the nature of the work, seeing patients wholeheartedly cared for by physicians and nurses. I started college on the pre-medical track but after not meeting my own academic expectations, I was discouraged and decided to explore other fields. I gravitated towards economics because I was fascinated by the intersection of individuals and societies and the rationale behind their decisions. In a healthcare economics course my senior year, I saw economic principles applied to how healthcare professionals and institutions promote positive health outcomes through effective patient care. As I found ways to combine my interests in healthcare and economics, I wanted to see the impact of these theoretical concepts on people’s lives. I revisited my pursuit of medicine and enrolled in a Post-Baccalaureate Pre-medical program. After graduation, I was more confident in my goals and no longer discouraged by minor setbacks.  


The analytical and problem-solving skills I developed in economics classes encouraged me to think strategically and optimize outcomes. I was able to leverage these skills as a research assistant under Dr. Wu Zeng, a physician and health economist. I saw how research in healthcare economics and health policy can guide decision-makers to the efficient delivery of healthcare resources. As a future physician, I value having this background to better understand the barriers faced by under-resourced patients. I experienced the need for this perspective first-hand while working as a health navigator for an Afghan refugee family. On our first call, the two eldest daughters requested a doctor to help their painful menstrual cycles. I was met with an arduous process of finding an OB/GYN physician of a similar Persian background who could speak Farsi and connect with the women culturally as well as accept Medicaid and be accessible by public transit. Though I found one nearly an hour away, I was disheartened by how far the women would have to commute. I was exposed to only a few of the healthcare barriers this family and many others face when seeking accessible and culturally competent healthcare services. As a physician, I want to build on my background in health policy and economics to help bridge the gap between underserved patient populations and their ability to access healthcare resources. 


I noticed parallels between the refugee family and my own Indo-Caribbean family in their abilities to seek out healthcare resources and understand health information. This became especially pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. My family immigrated to this country from Guyana and they have a strong history of cardiac disease. Despite their comorbidities, they overlooked the importance of safety precautions and caught the virus with severe symptoms. My mother, a nurse and the only medical professional in our family, became a familiar and trusted confidant. Family members who usually relied on natural remedies or who were afraid to see physicians found a sense of comfort in asking her for medical advice. I admired how she educated them using analogies and basic non-medical terms to avoid confusion. I want to emulate this role as an educator for patients of all ethnic and cultural backgrounds in hopes of increasing health literacy in these communities.   


My experiences have strengthened my resolve to become a physician devoted to helping others in vulnerable positions. I understand, through research and experience, the need for long-term economic and policy solutions in healthcare to assist underserved communities and reduce prevalent health inequities. I aspire to connect patients of all cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds with culturally competent healthcare. I look forward to the meaningful patient encounters and influential changes I will make as a physician.","While volunteering in a free clinic, a patient asked me a question in Spanish. I nervously stuttered, ‚ÄúNo hablo Espa√±ol. Voy a hablar a la enferma.‚Äù I quickly brought the nurse over to assist the patient. I admired the way the bilingual nurses and intake staff could easily connect and communicate with our Spanish-speaking patients. I yearned to one day improve my basic Spanish language skills and be able to connect with this patient population. _x000D_
_x000D_
After this interaction, I reflected on the power of human connection in medicine. My time at the clinic highlighted the hindrance of language and cultural barriers that can exist within patient interactions. It motivated me to want to work toward eliminating these barriers as a medical student so I can foster genuine connections with patients. In my medical education, I want to learn how to provide truly equitable and culturally competent care to my future patients. ","My current work as a refugee health navigator has pushed me to acknowledge and learn about the social and economic conditions affecting underserved communities. As a health navigator, I help an Afghan refugee family address their healthcare needs. In my first week working with the family, one of the daughters requested an urgent dentist appointment for her and her mother‚Äôs persistent toothaches. Thankfully, I found a dentist who accepted Medicaid and also spoke Farsi. The daughter expressed her gratitude and appreciation for having a dentist who could not only communicate with her and her mother, but also understand their background and connect with them. After this first appointment, I realized the importance of culturally competent health care to the family and other patients in their position. I continue to locate Persian physicians for the family and work toward improving their access quality healthcare services.  ",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought my senior year of college to a screeching halt. A few weeks following my virtual college graduation, I began a post-baccalaureate pre-medical program. At the time, my mother had ample exposure to COVID-19 in the hospital while working tirelessly as a healthcare provider. Our small home in Queens, New York felt even smaller as my sister and I, both active students, shared the kitchen counter for homework while our mother stayed in one of the two bedrooms. It took me time to adjust to the circumstances and I didn‚Äôt achieve the grades I had hoped for in my first science classes in the program. Through my mother, I witnessed the emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare providers. The bravery of my mother and all of the healthcare providers during the pandemic was inspiring and I look forward to becoming a part of that community as a future physician.",1,1,1

Yet, as I watched through the plexiglass of the tech room, Dr. M managed to rewire the heart’s electrical signals. Mesmerized by the heart’s real-time beating on the screen, I marveled at the seamless operation. Using their knowledge of cardiac pathophysiology, the team resolved irregular heart rhythms in under an hour.

Early exposure to the medical mysteries that plagued my family had fostered my fascination with the nuances of biology. Watching my mom navigate treatments for her rare Vitiligo from Eastern herbal remedies to aggressive Western UV radiation, and my brother’s weekly injections of a costly drug for an unresolvable immunology issue lead me to wonder how the human body was both so powerful yet fragile in the face of genetic abnormalities. 

Beginning with elementary school science fairs, my very early “research” became an ongoing analytical and creative endeavor to piece together biological concepts in unique ways. Later, my research examined genetic abnormalities in Human Breast Cancer Cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering. My idea was to design a small population of genetically engineered cancer cells that could alter signaling pathways, attempting to disrupt communication patterns with other circulating cancer cells to slow tumor progression.**

To continue my work, I began research with a Genetic Medicine Lab at the University of Michigan that had developed clinical drugs to target genetic foundations of cancer cells. What happened there for me was more than just research.

Lacking employee access, I used the public elevators at the Rogel Cancer Center to reach the research floors. The overwhelming size of the building and complicated maps did little to ease the stress of fellow elevator passengers heading to treatments and screenings, so I memorized the floors to provide direction. My brief exchanges with patients taught me how even small talk about the weather and laments about Michigan snow in the middle of spring lightened moods. I learned that cordial engagement was appreciated, and I looked forward to my elevator experiences as they helped me feel better connected to the community I was working within. 

Patient encounters during my internship with Radiation Oncology furthered my interest in the medical field. After partial tongue removal, a lady with oral cancer was referred for radiation therapy. I loved seeing the excitement on her face after I complimented her speech abilities and attributed such success to her optimistic nature and diligence in therapy. Having the capability to wield powerful applications of science as a future physician would allow me to continue cheering on the improvements of patients who have reached significant treatment milestones. 

Unfortunately, I also met individuals who did not respond well to radiation. These cases have inspired my REDcap database designs that are used in clinical studies, such as a novel one I designed for sarcoma patients at Michigan Medicine. Clinical research is something I foresee continuing in medical school as it will enhance my ability to piece together the symptoms of a patient’s case presentation to decide on an effective treatment path.

To combine my vision of being a part of a group that uses science coupled with effective communication to help others, I joined the Neurosurgery Clinical Outcomes Team. As part of a Michigan Medicine initiative that supports the American Spine Registry, I work to talk with and gather healthcare opinions from pre and post operative neurosurgical patients. The patients’ frustration towards strained recovery and limited contact with the primary surgeon mirrored my own frustration with my limited capacity to assist them. Although our conversations were not directly solving issues of opioid addictions and chronic pain, they showed me the importance of simply listening. From the elderly woman who told me about a busy day at her flower shop to the laugh I shared with a man who said he was referred to as a porcupine on the operative table when his ribs were poking out, I helped ensure that these patients knew that their healthcare group was supportive and conscious of their concerns, helping to ease these patients’ mindsets towards their surgical outcomes. Developing rapport with patients has shown me a facet of healthcare that is truly gratifying and how medicine goes beyond the implementation of science by helping through the power of empathy.

Thinking back to that Cardiac Cath Lab, I remembered how Dr. M resolved a serious heart condition all while talking through the operation to ease the patient's nerves exemplifying how I want to adopt both patient care values and a nuanced understanding of biology. As a physician, I will provide emotional support while also exercising my mind to restore the health of the strong spirited patients I meet, helping me to bring back the entertaining personalities that sickness has dampened. I want to be a doctor who empowers patients to not let a diagnosis be the end, but rather the beginning of their journey in uncovering how their body is adaptable to the world in unique and wondrous ways.

Initial adaptation to the high altitude was more difficult than I anticipated, especially seeing the prevalent use of oxygen masks. When me and one of my younger cousins I was traveling with underwent high altitude sickness, I learned about powerful local remedies, such as the scent of a herbal concoction. I was really given the chance to immerse myself within a unique culture, especially trying to converse with individuals in Cusco, who spoke a unique dialect of Spanish influenced by elements of the indigenous language Quechua. _x000D_

These experiences continue to resonate with me far beyond that trip. I have taken collegiate level classes in Spanish that have advanced my understanding of the language and allowed me to engage in communication on Hispanic society and culture. These classes were conducted only in Spanish, allowing me to better learn a language that many of my future ethnic patients may be comfortable with.","Addiction to pain medication and the opioid epidemic is a prevalent health issue in Chicago. I have dealt with the frustration of many surgical patients with restricted access to pain medications and patients that have been using opioids for years to treat chronic pain. For one patient who was confused and upset for being denied additional pain medication, I took the time to review clinician notes with the patient. The notes had said his past surgical history was a primary reason for restrictions. I carefully listened to his concerns and offered to help schedule an appointment with his nurse practitioner to talk about pain management techniques. These experiences have shown me that there is still much research and education needed on the scientific nature of opioid addiction and for safer alternatives that can be used for pain management. I have also been inspired to provide Naloxone training through my Red Cross Organization at the University of Michigan to prevent opioid overdoses._x000D_

Inhalers and nebulizers failed to treat a worsening asthma attack. Panicked, his parents dialed 911. EMTs arrived in minutes and rushed the little boy into the ambulance. As quickly as they’d come, the howling sirens and flashing red lights faded. My heart raced. Would my little brother survive?

Certain moments embed in our memories while shaping our perspectives, our life’s journey, and our understanding of its meaning. My lifelong rank as the healthy sibling of a chronically ill boy molded my identity, fostered an understanding of my values, and led me to my purpose.

I stood in front of Ms. Laman’s first-grade class with my Fisher-Price medical kit in hand. The case illustrated my dream career to my class: “When I grow up I want to be a doctor because they help sick people, like my little brother.” By elementary school, I already saw Travis stay in the pediatric ICU - twice. Although a first grader, I understood asthma prevented him from living like a normal kid; rather than having fun, he sat in a hospital bed for days or spent hours at the doctor's. Asthma followed him everywhere. A protective big sister, I desired to save him. So, at age six, I set off on my journey toward doctorhood, determined to cure his illness.

I learned his chronic asthma was incurable after witnessing a series of grim hospitalizations. His worst occurred after EMTs loaded him into that ambulance five years ago. A seven-day struggle ensued and I helplessly watched the same, chaotic cycle: He cried, gasping for air. PICU staff fought to get his oxygen levels up. The steroids worsened his symptoms. Doctors found new treatments. As I watched the doctors tackle cumbersome obstacles to save my brother, I realized my trivial toy medical kit lacked the heavy weight of hardship real physicians bore. Childhood innocence could no longer protect me from grasping the harsh realities of healthcare. 

Despite the tiring hurdles, his physicians fought his asthma with tenacity, proving to me a career in medicine can be more rewarding than strenuous. I respected their tireless determination to treat my brother. I admired their ability to admit their errors and problem-solve when they prescribed an unsuccessful treatment. I valued their compassion as they eased my family’s unbearable anxiety. I wanted to impact others like they did me. But did I have the nerve to pursue such a taxing career? Determined to know the answer, I sought opportunities that provided a definitive answer. 

The old man looked white as a ghost. I placed the pulse oximeter on his index finger. It measured an oxygen level of 91. My heart raced as I anxiously recalled the implications of such a low reading. He must have contracted the virus. To my surprise, his test read negative. I remembered certain people, like my little brother Travis, naturally have below-average resting levels. I uneasily reasoned his low oxygen was due to his old age and sent him home. A nervous pit immediately swelled in my gut.‘When Travis fell near 90, Mom called Dr. Smith…if he couldn’t get his oxygen up, he went to the ICU.’ I knew the man needed medical attention, regardless of his negative test. Minutes after he left, I got ahold of the attending physician. “The older patient tested negative for the virus, but his oxygen was lower than normal. I really think he needs to go to the hospital.” She called the patient and advised him to go to the ER, where he was treated. I felt relieved knowing I had left nothing to chance. With every subsequent challenge at the testing site, I grew confident I could endure the harsh realities of medicine. Any doubts I may have harbored about my career choice vanished. I knew exactly what I wanted to do: be a doctor. I quickly sought more challenges to quench my thirst for patient care.

The baby wailed as the ultrasound tech rubbed the transducer along her hip. I tuned out her cries and furiously typed as Dr. Doe dictated her findings to me. “Her left hip is dislocated.” My heart sank. The hip abduction brace failed to treat the baby’s hip dysplasia. Her mother cried hearing her daughter needed an invasive operation to prevent a future of hardship. I was immediately reminded of my Mom. I knew the woman felt helpless, unable to save her child. I kept my eyes on her with a soft gaze in an unspoken pursuit to comfort her. Now I felt even more motivated to become a physician, desiring to provide strength and guidance to individuals enduring hardship.

In these hectic yet familiar moments, my life came full circle. I now bore the responsibility to help ensure the health of human beings and provide reassurance to their loved ones - just as doctors did for my little brother and my family so many times. I found true fulfillment helping those who stood in the shoes I once filled. I sincerely understood the tribulations patients and their families endured and desired to soothe their anxieties and tackle their maladies. Working with patients over the years, I learned I could be what I always wanted - someone who empathizes with, nurtures, and guides people battling tough predicaments. My journey strengthened my first grade dream. Today, I still say: when I grow up, I want to be a doctor.","As a medical scribe at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles, I interact with children from various cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Every day, I witness the effects of healthcare inequality: patients of lower socioeconomic status struggle to receive prescribed orthopedic bracewear; non-English speaking families wait longer to see the doctor, as they stand by for the clinics‚Äô single interpreter; families from smaller communities commute hours to receive specialized care. I understand multiple aspects of the social experience contribute to a range of inequitable health outcomes. Seeing the effects of systemic health inequality firsthand, I seek to acknowledge and understand the barriers hindering individual access to healthcare, and actively listen to patients directly affected by such inequities. At Rush Medical College, I will work alongside my peers to  advocate for and help cultivate a culture of inclusion and equity among underserved patients to improve healthcare for all.","With profound confidence, Jessy read the Harry Potter passage aloud for his peers. I watched him in awe: in just six weeks, the shy third grader transformed from an insecure reader to an extraordinary orator. During my sophomore year at UCLA, I coached Jessy and his classmates in the art of dramatic reading, volunteering with a nonprofit that supports underserved students through literary education. Initially, most students showed deficits in their reading comprehension. But, with incredible perseverance and help from our team of tutors, each student showed significant improvement in their reading skills and overall confidence. This experience taught me that empowering students through creative, individualized instruction strengthens their personal and academic development. Tutoring children in underserved school districts, I realized the importance of equitable instruction; everyone has the right to learn skills, such as reading, in an optimal environment, suited for their needs.",,,1,"I woke up on March 9, 2020 with a nasty cold. I grabbed my laptop to email my nursing volunteer coordinator: ‚ÄúOver the weekend, I developed a chest cold. Given recent concerns of coronavirus, I feel it would be best if I did not come into my shift this evening. Let me know if I can reschedule after spring break.‚Äù Unfortunately, I never rescheduled. When the pandemic hit, the hospital suspended the nursing volunteer program and my healthcare journey came to an abrupt halt. No longer able to care for patients, I worked remotely in different fields to explore other interests. But over time, I grew unsatisfied. So, when asked to work in a COVID lab, I eagerly accepted the challenge. In this fast-paced environment, I conquered obstacles, expanded my clinical knowledge and felt fulfilled working with patients. Though the pandemic initially interrupted my pursuit of medicine, it eventually led me to realize medicine truly was my calling, inspiring me to pursue other clinical positions.",1,1,2

Despite this neutral sentiment, my mother overlooked one flaw of time: it had been quick to discriminate against us. My childhood experiences are filled with relatives that succumbed early to heart attacks, strokes, and cancer. In hindsight, their premature deaths could have been prevented with timely interventions. Mental illness and years of addiction compounded the structural barriers to accessing preventative healthcare in my family. In our inner-city Brooklyn neighborhood, our motto is ""never ran, never will,"" a testament to our culture of fighting to survive. Because of the massive violence in Brownsville, we coined our local hospital the ""gunshot hospital,"" only seeking health services there for traumatic injuries. Most, like my family, couldn't afford to travel outside the neighborhood for their healthcare needs. Even those with health insurance never seemed to get the same physician twice, making it difficult to establish a relationship with any medical provider.

The lack of quality and accessible medical professionals is a glaring deficit in my community. In particular, we have a paucity of trusted primary care providers, who are the initial point of contact for health services and education in healthcare. We need providers who understand the reality of living in disadvantaged communities and are invested in patient care informed by social determinants of health. My personal and professional experiences showed me that community-oriented physician advocates willing to provide long-term patient-centered care could have improved my family members’ longevity. I want to be that physician advocate, striving to improve my community's health and winning this race against time on a systemic level.

The desire to advocate for my community's health started early in my life. As a high school student, I observed that my neighborhood had a surplus of liquor stores and a dearth of fresh groceries, making it a “food desert.” My education taught me repeatedly that health and wellness begin with the foods we consume. To overcome this barrier, I started a vegetable garden in my backyard. I shared my knowledge and produce with my neighbors and assisted them with growing foods like peppers and herbs. In the fall, our gardens become plentiful enough for us to collectively donate a vibrant cornucopia of vegetables to the local food pantry. 

This experience of community action affecting health influenced my decision to become a physician. During my undergraduate studies, a class discussion about the preventability of strokes led me to ponder the connection between underserved communities and the unknown benefits of risk factor modifications. Wanting to learn more about stroke prevention and treatment,I was chosen to pursue an internship at the Ayer Neuroscience Institute. Here, I learned about the drug Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), which prevents impairments after a stroke, but only when administered within three hours of stroke onset. This timing is crucial in disadvantaged areas, where there needs to be more education about recognizing stroke symptoms and promptly seeking care. Medical providers that are aware of the social and economic situations that hasten poor health outcomes can give patients a fair shot against time. My goal is to be a primary care physician who can educate community members about preventing debilitating diseases and address barriers such as transportation that may delay care. 

My vision for the impact I can have as a primary care physician has been further solidified in my role as a clinical research assistant at Weill Cornell Medicine. One of my job responsibilities is to recruit subjects for a qualitative research study that aims to elucidate the barriers Black patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have in managing their cardiovascular comorbidities. In an interview, a subject, Ms. J, shared, ""The Tuskegee experiment is fresh in our minds. There's the trust issue, intimidation issue, and lack of knowledge issue. Many things are working against us."" Even so, she said the ""polite and patient"" way I spoke with her validated her existence as a human being and made her hopeful that healthcare is becoming more inclusive. Through this study, I saw that as an academic primary care physician, I could work to improve the health and community of my patients, and I can contribute to generating scientific knowledge that engages patients historically underrepresented in research.  

As I begin my medical training, I look forward to building upon the insights I have gained from my research experience and working towards repairing vulnerable populations' trust in the healthcare system. The reality that underserved communities have generations of early deaths, a simple measure of compromised health, proves the inequitable allocation of precious time and medical interventions. Medicine should be as individual as it is universal, starting with culturally competent primary care physicians who can promote honesty, transparency, and generational health. I will give my all to this mission: guaranteeing a safe space and face to those from marginalized communities like mine.","On one of my first shifts on a Jewish holiday as a medical assistant for a pediatrician that served a predominately Orthodox Jewish population, a father and his young daughter asked me to turn on the light in a bathroom. I didn‚Äôt understand a very simple request at first because of the language and lack of knowledge barrier. After speaking with my coworker, I learned that this community often could not operate anything electrical during specific holidays. It was apparent that I needed to do more research to have sufficient knowledge of the population I was interacting with daily. After a few weeks, I learned about most holidays and began picking up Yiddish phrases and words with the help of my coworkers. Knowing their religious customs and practices, I anticipated their needs, which helped establish comfort between the community and me. I explored what it meant to provide culturally competent care and its relationship to cultural humility and recognizing one‚Äôs possible biases. ","It was a hot summer day in July 2019, but the air was filled with laughter, balloons, and bubbles. It was ""Unity in the Community"" Day, and as an event manager, I helped to organize this experience with the event planner company Epiphany Blue. Epiphany Blue specifically creates programs and events for each community and the youth alike. _x000D_
 _x000D_
I provided some ideas about programs that can address my neighborhood's needs. For instance, I commented on our area's lack of affordable and accessible food. Epiphany Blue then brought farmers to the event to provide tips on growing fresh produce and shopping for fresh produce. Our community health center was there to provide health tips from a trustworthy source and familiarize our youth with the center. By creating this space for my neighborhood, I promoted healthy living and harnessed the power of arts and culture to establish familiarity with one another. _x000D_

My fascination with the game of baseball began when I was just four years old watching my father coach my older brother’s baseball team in Danville, California. As a batboy, I loved the sound of metal spikes clanking on the pavement, and slowly became a student of the game. In middle school, after moving to Las Vegas, I recall the hectic days of playing on four different teams; switching uniforms to rush across town for the next game was not unusual. Three and a half years at Bishop Gorman HS in Las Vegas and half a year at San Ramon Valley HS in Danville included regular season play, year-round showcases, college development-recruiting camps, and working with professional trainers. Family vacations were often spent attending tournaments around the United States. Over family dinners, when baseball was somehow not the topic of discussion, my parents would talk about their work in the medical field. My father is an Emergency Medicine physician, and my mother an ICU nurse. I recall being keenly aware and attentive to their medical stories and quietly curious when it came to their respect and enjoyment for medicine. On weekends, when I was not at the batting cage, my father invited me to accompany him during portions of his ED shifts. The teamwork and family-like atmosphere of the doctors, nurses, and ancillary staff was captivating and uplifting, and I was intrigued by this medical exposure.

Initially recruited to play baseball at Point Loma Nazarene University, one of the happiest days of my life was when I received a call from the University of Southern California baseball coach in July, one month before starting college. He invited me to play baseball and attend college at USC, one of America's most prestigious and respected college baseball programs over the last 50 years. Playing Division I baseball demanded a significant time commitment and was not always glamorous. As one of the team catchers, I was on call for the pitching staff before, during, and after the hundreds of hours we dedicated to field practice and training. It was a privilege to be a part of something so special, and I loved the players, coaches, and overall team camaraderie. Yet it quickly became apparent that my childhood aspirations of playing professional baseball were not in my future. After numerous meetings with my academic and pre-health advisors, I resolved that as much as I loved the sport that inspired so many years of my life, it was time to make a transition. I will never forget the day I officially decided to hang up my spikes. It was early fall, my fourth year at USC. I walked into the coaches’ office and poured out my heart. There were tears and hugs that day, but my coaches and teammates respected and understood why I decided to step down from the baseball team, sharing their full support.

To catch up on my required pre-med classes, it was necessary to enroll in continuous summer school sessions and pursue an increased upper-level course load. Over the last six semesters at USC and five summer sessions at UNLV and USC, my tenacity and hard work enabled me to achieve a respectable 3.9 GPA. My exposure to clinical medicine was bolstered while working as an undergraduate research assistant with the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Emergency Department. My role was to obtain informed consent from patients and families presenting with head and/or abdominal trauma to evaluate the potential overuse of CT's in pediatric trauma patients. Although these families were often in distress, I looked forward to the exciting new task of interacting with patients and making small compassionate connections. 

After graduating college and training to become a medical scribe, I now rotate through three local Las Vegas hospital ED’s as a key component of our medical team. Supporting and interactively assisting our ED physicians is challenging and exciting as we face multiple exam rooms full of anxious patients. Whether documenting charts or contributing to the team’s camaraderie, I approach my role with the same mentality that has been ingrained in me throughout my lifetime of baseball. Before each shift, I take a few moments to gather my thoughts and prepare myself for any ""curveballs"" that might be thrown my way over the next 10 - 12 hours.

Twenty years have passed since I was that four-year-old boy, idolizing his older brother on the baseball field. My experiences as a student-athlete still apply now as I tie up my medical scrubs rather than lacing up my metal spikes. The lessons learned that helped me overcome adversity, make sacrifices, and persevere will stick with me throughout my life. My years of dedication to baseball have prepared me to invest that same commitment to my medical education. I look forward to applying the lessons I have learned on the field, in the classroom, and in the medical setting to gain each patient's trust, partnering up and “coaching” them to achieve their healthcare goals. I am excited about my decision to pursue a career in medicine, and I look forward to the experiences, challenges, and emotions that lie ahead.","A lifetime of baseball has enabled me to develop the skills and confidence to work with any team while understanding the importance of placing the needs of others before my own. The collectivist, ‚ÄúWin as a team and Lose as a team‚Äù mentality has shown me the importance of a strong and unified community, and how necessary it is to foster goodwill, teamwork, and cooperation for the sake of that community‚Äôs health. Going to college as a student-athlete in South Central Los Angeles provided me the opportunity to appreciate an extremely diverse culture and city. On my various teams, I developed a natural ability to connect with fellow players from many different backgrounds, where we consistently worked hard, embraced our differences, and persevered to achieve our greatest potential. It has been a pleasure to learn and grow from the stories and experiences of others, allowing me to broaden my horizons to become the culturally competent physician, leader, and individual I yearn to be.","Through the Big Brother Big Sister organization, I was matched to mentor Eddie, a 15-year-old boy with autism from a low-income, Hispanic household. During our visits, Eddie and I play sports, chess, and talk about whatever is going on in his life at the time. Initially, our various activities did not spark his interest until we went to the golf range, to which he had never been. While hitting balls, I was surprised to see Eddie turn to me with a smile on his face asking if we could ‚Äúdo this again?‚Äù That night, I was proud when his mom called thanking me for discovering Eddie‚Äôs newfound interest in golf, an accomplishment Eddie‚Äôs mom did not think was possible. Though Eddie is my mentee, our shared time has taught me the potential every individual possesses if given the opportunity to have a mentor who encourages positive experiences.

From friendly wagers, I had earned enough money to buy comedy tickets I had been saving up for. Or so I thought, until an older man entered the gym and offered “double or nothing” as incentive for us to continue playing. I thought it would be an easy win, but after a couple games, I was quickly humbled, and the man generously returned my winnings to my cousins. He gave me a ride home, and I learned he was a hospitalist named Andrew. We became good friends and would frequently play basketball together after that. After getting to know my interests and personality, he alluded that medicine may be fitting for me and I began exploring the idea with him; he ultimately became a close professional and personal mentor to me. In retrospect, everyone won that day: my cousins kept their money, Andrew got his exercise, and I started my path to medicine.
In my early years of college my family struggled but navigating through these difficulties provided me with valuable life lessons. During sophomore year my mother was arrested after an altercation with my father. She was in a difficult place and her health and well-being became my priority. I coordinated many hearings, appointments, and court orders all requiring a significant amount of time, effort, and attention. Attending every appointment, I mediated interviews hindered by the Arabic language barrier, while collaborating with her psychiatrist to be an effective caretaker at home. This meant organizing and understanding my mother’s medications and creating an environment at home that fostered her healing. In retrospect, my mom was my first patient; through her I learned how to provide care for those with illnesses — seeing how proper care and treatment can improve someone’s life. I learned to be hopeful during tough times and discovered that I value providing service and care to people to alleviate pain like I had for my mom. I knew through this experience that I wanted to provide solutions to mitigate suffering for those with complex medical conditions, encouraging me to continue my journey in medicine.
During these difficult times, I enjoyed working within my neurobiology research group. I found comfort in my ability to find answers and develop conclusions within my work when many other aspects of my life seemed uncertain. I enjoyed learning to fold peptides and perform electrophysiology experiments, while deepening my understanding of the principles of scientific inquiry. I am especially proud of my work investigating the novel alpha10 nicotinic receptor, in search for a molecular probe to elucidate its clinical applications. I learned to utilize the available literature, develop proper protocols, and follow data to appropriate conclusions. Mentored by a physician scientist, I began to understand the responsibility of physicians to advance science and continue as lifelong learners. As I continued in the lab, I also began working as a cardiology tech which allowed me to experience meaningful interactions with patients. I enjoyed educating patients about heart monitors and finding ways to personalize and simplify my explanations. These opportunities were similar to my other roles in teaching and tutoring while directly impacting someone’s health. I am enthusiastic about a future where I may gain knowledge to educate patients as a clinician and to progress science as a researcher.
Looking back, I found that when I wasn’t teaching the patients, they were teaching me. My favorite part of my job was connecting with them and learning their stories, triumphs, and struggles. While stationed at the cancer hospital one day, I entered a patient’s room whose name was of Middle Eastern origin, like myself. His name was “Ali,” and he reminded me of my older brother. While weak, bed bound, and visibly in pain from his cancer, he managed to express liveliness and emotion in our conversation. Although our respective countries were distant and even spoke different languages, he said, “We are neighbors.” With the little Arabic he knew, he called me “habibi,” a term of endearment. I spent quite a bit of time keeping him company in his room that evening. It was difficult to hear his agony but also inspiring to see his optimism. This patient encounter emphasized the important connections I hope to make as a physician
Leaving Ali’s room, I felt some pride in distracting him from his hardships. However, I realized that was all I was able to do—provide a little comfort and a momentary distraction. Regardless of our interaction, he would still wake up the next morning in pain with a bleak diagnosis. I desired to answer his complex medical questions and make decisions to lessen his suffering. After much reflection, I have realized that it is the summation of my life’s events that led me to pursue a career in medicine. Ultimately, I hope to work toward a future where I may provide solutions and treatment plans to create more positive outcomes for patients from a variety of socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. I’m grateful my mom’s inspiring resolution, and I’m hopeful that as a physician I can provide the compassionate care integral for her recovery to heal other patients.","As a Syrian who traveled to the US at a young age, I share a special experience with younger immigrants in helping my parents assimilate to a new world. While performing an intake with a Hispanic mother at the free clinic, I began speaking to her through her son. I‚Äôd never met the young boy, but I felt connected by our shared interpreter role that symbolizes our responsibility as mediators between cultures. I didn‚Äôt live their culture, but I understood them because I had been in the boy‚Äôs shoes. Residing at a cultural intersection most of my life, I‚Äôve been afforded a perspective that enables me to understand a unique set of people and scenarios. I‚Äôm also reminded of my coworker, a father of two from Rwanda. We‚Äôre mostly dissimilar but have developed a close friendship through discussions of our immigration story. Ultimately, I‚Äôve learned my unique perspectives have allowed me to find similarities with others, and I‚Äôm excited to connect with the diverse population in Chicago.","Volunteering at my local free clinic has been an especially meaningful experience for me as I learned to care for the vulnerable populations in Salt Lake City. Throughout my time I‚Äôve cared for many unique patients and gained insight into the health disparities they face. After a couple years of developing my skills around the clinic, I was excited to join our diabetes team that assisted in the after hours diabetes clinic. Mary was one of the first patients I met who taught me the impact of these efforts. After performing her eye exam and retinal scan I brought her into an exam room to take her vitals and blood sugar. I enjoyed our conversation listening to how much she‚Äôd improved since her last visit. I could hear the genuine excitement in her voice explaining how she was down 20 pounds with blood sugars under 100. As I examined her feet, I felt proud to be part of her battle against diabetes. I hope to find similar opportunities in Chicago, serving the diverse population of patients.",,,1,"The pandemic has been a difficult time for my family and me. In the initial spring months, my father lost his job and was unemployed for quite some time. My brother and I tried to make up for the lost income; however, my paychecks diminished when research labs on campus prohibited undergraduate access. As bills began piling up, we could no longer keep our home. My parents and brother moved into an apartment while I found an affordable sublet. Simultaneously, I began adapting my research ambitions, scheduled shadows, and volunteer obligations that were canceled. Although I was disappointed, I saw an opportunity to be creative with my time and assist in our global crisis. With the new ability to connect online, I worked to connect high schools with universities, developing an online volunteer tutoring group for struggling students. Making these transitions mid-semester was challenging, but I felt fortunate compared to others and grew through managing the obstacles.",1,0,2

Trust is the belief that someone is reliable, good, honest, and effective. Trust doesn’t come easily, especially in difficult moments. Particularly in medicine, during moments of need, patients don’t always have a choice for whom they must rely on and trust for their care. I have found trust to be something that must be earned by helping others through some of their most vulnerable moments in life—in infancy, adulthood, and even death. These experiences helped solidify my desire to pursue a career as a physician, a position where trust is foundational. 

When I was a volunteer swim instructor, one of my first students was an eleven-month-old baby. All of the confidence I thought I had flew out the window the moment I realized the responsibility I was being given with such a small human being. What made me qualified to teach someone so young and vulnerable? The child’s mother was willing to blindly put her trust in me, a complete stranger, when she dropped the infant in my arms. I had to think quickly and carefully on my feet to ensure the safety of the infant and maintain the mother’s trust. To do this, I kept the child’s safety my number one priority and involved the mother closely during every lesson. At the end of the six-week course, the infant was happy and made great progress, and the mother felt more secure in her son’s safety. Because they were willing to trust me, I gained confidence in working with young children along with their parents and discovered a new passion for working with kids. 

Another experience that helped me learn the importance of trust was my position at Chrysalis, a support home for individuals with disabilities. One of the clients I worked with was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and, as a result, was impulsive and had a hard time expressing her emotions in appropriate ways. The client was insistent on doing things on her own, and she frequently talked about how she didn’t like being constantly supervised. She clearly didn’t believe the program could help her. I knew I needed to approach her behavior plan differently and in a manner that addressed her feelings. If she didn’t trust me, there was no way I could help her improve her behavior. I made it my goal to become her friend and not solely another authority figure. Because of my approach, she became much more receptive to my guidance. After a year of maintaining her trust, I was able to help her enroll in college and finish her first semester. She still calls me her “extra” school success advisor.  

To kickstart my medical career, I obtained my CNA certificate and began working at a Memory Care Unit in an assisted living facility. One night while I was working, my residents had just finished eating their dinners and I set up the movie ""The Sound of Music"" for them to watch. The 180-gallon fish tank illuminated the room. It was my turn to change the cold packs for a recovering male resident who was restricted to his room because of hip surgery. I was worried about him because he had refused dinner that day and had been running a slight fever. The first thing I did when I entered his room was check his vital signs. His eyes were closed, and his oxygen compressor was making its slight air release noise every few seconds. When I read the thermometer, I stopped in my tracks. 86.0° F. I quickly scanned the thermometer again. A similar reading displayed. His chest was not rising or falling. He had no pulse. 

I quickly notified the Registered Nurse of his passing and began the postmortem process. I asked if any of his family would be coming to say goodbye but was informed that they would not be able to get there for a few hours. He was to stay in his room by himself until they arrived. This made me sad. I had been working with this resident for months, and I knew I had to be there for him. As the end of my shift neared and I completed my other duties, I immediately went to his room to keep him company. The uneasiness I felt earlier turned into a feeling of responsibility. I was his caregiver, the person who his family trusted to be there with him during his most vulnerable moments, even his last. As I sat there, I was overcome with raw emotion. Just a few hours ago, he had been reading the newspaper and cracking jokes to me about my ponytail resembling a horse’s ass. Now, the ""Jeopardy"" noises from the other room filled the silence as I sat with him. ""Jeopardy"" was his favorite show. 

Now as I prepare for a career in the medical field, I ask myself: who gave me the right to be present in each of these moments? The answer lies in the reality that I am preparing myself for a career that is built upon unconditional trust. Who is there for others in their most vulnerable moments at all stages of life? A physician. A physician is not just someone who diagnoses and treats individuals who walk through hospital doors. A physician is someone who holds people’s trust during their most mentally and physically challenging moments. I look at being in this position of trust in a humbling manner and as a great honor.","When I began my position as a service leader, I met with one of the tribal leaders. She explained to me that many of these children were not expected to pursue academics, graduate high school, or attend college. Due to past indigenous strains, these children are expected to help support their families as soon as they are old enough, so it often cuts out time for education. One day at the center I witnessed an 11-year-old child creating a spot for her sleep-deprived younger brother to lay because he hadn‚Äôt been put to bed the night before. In my family, education has always been a top priority, so this was different. Coming from a place of privilege I realize that not every family is able to prioritize things like education. I learned many must prioritize other things for survival‚Äôs sake and I must support that. Instead of just giving academic motivation, the focus at the center became on providing a safe, comfortable place for these children to leave their responsibilities behind.","In my role as a Direct Support Staff for individuals with disabilities, I observed that many of my clients could not advocate for their own practices of healthy habits‚Äîboth mental and physical. It was my role as their caregiver to provide tools and direction for them to become productive citizens of their community. This included encouraging my clients to choose healthy eating habits, engage in physical activities, practice regulating their emotions, and set goals for their future. When I started working with one specific client, she had strict supervision guidelines. She could not be left alone during any task and had monitored phone calls. I took the time to create connections, establish a trusting relationship, and provide resources for her as her staff. Because of this, she was able to enroll in college, obtain her driver‚Äôs license, and began transitioning into a more independent lifestyle away from the program.",,,1,"During the early spring and summer of 2020, I had planned on acquiring another CNA position at my local hospital, although due to COVID-19, the hospital and many other healthcare facilities remained on a hiring freeze for the entirety of this time requiring me to find a caregiving position elsewhere, one that did not hold the position title of ""CNA"". Instead, I obtained a job at the company Chrysalis to work as a ""Direct Support Staff"" for individuals with disabilities. This Direct Support Staff position had some similar caregiving and healthcare duties as that of my previous CNA position._x000D_

Also, while I was able to complete some physician job shadowing during this last year, because of COVID-19, I was not able to begin in-person job shadowing until late 2021 and therefore was not able to obtain as many physician job-shadowing hours and experience as I would have preferred.",1,0,3

I knew that I had an older brother that died because of his “bad heart,” but the night my mother handed me a book about the cardiovascular system, I had an interest to learn more. Of course at this time I did not understand the complex anatomy of the heart, and likely could not even pronounce complicated words like “cardiovascular,” but I remember how I felt holding a book that I believed held the answers to his heart condition. I would trace my fingers along the outline of the animated heart, trying to imagine how strong it must be to propel blood to the tips of my fingers and toes, and I would press my ear against a family member’s chest in an effort to hear the “lub-dub” of a healthy heart. I was fascinated by its complexity, but as any 10-year old, I was unfamiliar with what varied avenues medicine could explore aside from understanding the body’s organs. My initial introduction into medicine was two-fold. I had a fascination with the intricacies in the human body, and I had love for my older brother that further drove this passion. These two aspects of medicine, both the science and humanity features, have continued to show up in my pursuit of medicine from the classroom to the Emergency Department. I have an interest in understanding the human body, and I have a passion for caring for people through my investment in the individual. Through this, I have come to a clear understanding as to why I choose medicine.
 In college, I volunteered at St. Louis Children’s Hospital as a Patient Care Assistant. I would visit patients in their room while holding toys underneath both arms in an effort to surprise kids and their families with fun activities. The kids would often be so absorbed in our silly games, that their parents felt comfortable enough to leave the room to finally get fresh air. I felt proud being able to help patients and their families feel better, even if for only a short amount of time. “Make sure to visit me again!” kids would exclaim, as I left their room. I frequently made an effort to recognize their faces, and the toys they enjoyed most to ensure I would align my tasks to their needs. But because I only worked a few hours every week, our interactions were limited in my role as a volunteer. I imagined myself as a trained physician at Children’s Hospital and how differently the patient care interaction would look compared to my volunteer position. I envisioned how I could create relationships with my patients and their families and watch their condition change over the span of minutes, hours, and days. The end goal would still remain relatively similar, however: To reestablish a sense of normalcy in the patients' and families' lives.
 The connection I experienced as I interacted with patients was something I witnessed as medical providers interacted with each other to find a solution. I would frequently watch in awe as physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and more would “round” and discuss both short-term and long-term care plans for patients with their families. I would get excited to be part of such a team dynamic that had the overall goal of making the patient feel better. I recognized that within my role as a Patient Care Assistant, however, I was part of a similar team. We would enter our shift and interact with fellow volunteers and supervisors to create a plan for the shift: What rooms we needed to visit; whose room is most urgent; what toys do we need to pick up and sanitize; what stationary activities should we set up for within the Patient Care Room; and overall, how can we help the patients and their families feel better and support their medical team in the process?
 I recognized this team goal more as I shadowed in the Emergency Department at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. “Hi, my name is Dr. ___, and this is our medical team. We are here to help you feel better,” was a frequent sentiment given by physicians when introducing themselves to the patient. I recognized compassion from the doctors when anxious patients would express their concerns about being in the Emergency Department, and how the doctors would respond by talking to the patient about their needs, providing extra blankets, and holding hands with the patient as the examination continued. The investment in the patient would continue into the Work Room, where physicians would collaborate on a comprehensive plan for the patient to ensure that they would receive the best care possible. As an undergraduate student that was simply shadowing, I was able to take part in the discussions between the physicians and other medical professionals who all wanted to help the patient return to their sense of normalcy.
 In the future, I look to connect my passion for science and people in a salient combination of community engagement in medicine. I’ve had experiences managing the rigor of both science and advocacy throughout my academic career, and my most recent involvement was the management of studying for the MCAT while ensuring my family member’s health and financial needs were being met during his medical crisis. Medical school will prepare me to heal both the individual patient and the community through my work as a physician.","During my time working as a Patient Care Technician at Total Access Urgent Care, I have had exposure to many differing perspectives. One viewpoint in particular, however, was from a patient who was very vocal about his hesitancy surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient emphasized his reluctance in receiving the vaccine and wanted my input about his decision. In an effort to better understand his perspective, I instead asked more about what led him to his reluctance. After having a greater understanding of the patient‚Äôs decision making process, I then decided to share my own decision making process when discussing my vaccine experience. _x000D_
_x000D_
Although the pandemic has unfortunately become a point of much disagreement for our world, this conversation between a patient and myself ended with a greater understanding of an opposing viewpoint. I learned that to be a physician it requires conversation, context, and patience in order to effectively treat and care for an individual. _x000D_
","Throughout my personal, academic and professional career, I continue to have a deep investment in the St. Louis community. In an effort to reduce health disparities in my community, for example, I founded the College Admissions and Networking program (CAN) through partnerships with local school districts and the Urban League of St. Louis during a summer in college. CAN was a program for local highschool students who were interested in attending college, and looking to learn more about the application process. CAN provided students with mentors, professional networking connections, a financial stipend, resume and personal statement workshops, and more. Through CAN, students became more confident not only with their college application, but also with their professional and personal journey._x000D_

As a result of the pandemic, and the decreased number of medical professionals able to care for the community, I decided to take an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) class.

The neighboring fire department needed our help: my first code. As I buckled myself into my seat, palms sweating, a sense of calm rushed over me with the click of the other seatbelts. We were a team, and we had prepared for this. When my crew arrived on the scene, I watched as one of my crew members took over chest compressions while another pushed multiple doses of atropine and epinephrine. As I charged the defibrillator to deliver a shock and quickly prepared additional doses of medication, I felt a sense of purpose. I was part of a team working to save someone’s life. Through the haze of activity, our cardiac monitor detected a weak pulse. I helped secure the patient to a backboard and carry him to the ambulance. As we neared the doors of the emergency department, we lost his pulse. I lingered as the ED staff took over his care, pacing nervously, watching as the pulse came back onto the monitor. We had done it, as a team. Through my work as an EMT and firefighter, I have had the privilege to continually witness firsthand the seamless teamwork and collaboration that is required in healthcare today. These experiences have inspired me to become a physician, someone who not only makes diagnoses and institutes proper interventions, but also supports his team and works with them to give the best possible care to his patients.

While the successes were initially what drew me to medicine, I have since learned that I can make a significant impact even when things do not go as planned. A week into my junior year of college, I responded to a call for an elderly patient who was unresponsive with suspected COVID-19. As we sped to the address, I suited up in my gown, strapped on my N-95 mask, and prepared my equipment for a full code. When we entered the patient’s house, it was clear that she had passed away hours before. After I helped cover her with a sheet, I glanced at the coffee table and saw photos of her with little children, presumably her grandchildren. Suddenly, the body underneath the sheet became much more than a casualty of COVID-19 or a patient for whom we came too late. As we stood outside waiting for the coroner to arrive, her husband told us how much he loved her and how grateful he was for the time they had spent together. I realized that there is so much more to medicine than simply saving a patient. Healthcare professionals are constantly privy to some of the most vulnerable movements of their patients’ lives. Compassion and support are just as important as providing quality clinical care to patients. The interactions with patients and their families became a focal point for me in my clinical duties. Even after many tiring, stressful nights in the back of the ambulance, these conversations are what inspire me to continue working. My desire to be a physician is motivated by the opportunity this will give me to make a difference in the lives of my patients and their families on a daily basis.

Through my clinical experiences, I have seen the extent to which medical conditions can affect patients’ lives and how much more there is to discover in the field of medicine. This is what drew me to research. As an EMT, I often helped a patient with epilepsy who had frequent grand mal seizures. While there were things that we could do in the moment to stop the seizures, the fact she had them so frequently added an element of unpredictability to her life that constantly hung over her. I wanted to delve further into the underlying etiology of epilepsy and what could be done to improve these patients’ lives. I joined a lab my junior year where I researched mutations of a neurodevelopmental protein that, when mutated, could lead to epilepsy in infancy. We found that the mutated proteins had a low affinity for neural cadherin, thus leading to seizures. Uncovering what causes this form of epilepsy is integral in designing new therapies for millions of people. While patient care is my passion, I have become excited about the ways research can change what is possible in the treatment of patients.

I want to be a physician so that I can play a pivotal role in improving the human condition by way of administering quality, compassionate care to all of my patients. I have come to view treating patients as not only a responsibility, but as a privilege. Physicians have the ability to be a healing, restorative force in valuable human lives, and what drives me to get out of bed each day is the opportunity to positively impact someone’s life, especially through their health. I have realized that equally as important as being an effective diagnostician is being present in my daily interactions with others, whether they be my colleagues, my patients, or their families. I firmly believe that all people deserve the best health care possible, and I am excited to bring my passion for helping others to my medical studies and for the future interactions that will shape who I become as a clinician.","I had the privilege to serve on a medical service trip to a small village in Guatemala. None of our patients spoke English, and they came from a culture vastly different from ours. The best way to understand those different from you is to listen. We could only communicate through local translators, but I learned more about their culture than I probably would have from any other way. We talked about the food they ate, the traditions they held, and how their medical conditions affected how their society viewed them. I learned a clinician‚Äôs approach must be tailored to each patient and that it must be a priority to honor a patient‚Äôs medical decisions in an ethical manner. Medicine is a bridge that has the power to reach across cultural, social, gender, religious, ethnic, and socioeconomic boundaries. All people need and deserve quality care, and it is our duty to learn more about our patients to ensure that we are always sensitive, respectful, and kind in our approach to caring for them.","I‚Äôve assisted many students who attempted to end their life or struggled with suicidal ideation throughout my time serving as an EMT with Cedarville University Emergency Medical Services (CU-EMS). One call, in particular, was very impactful; my crew was dispatched for a patient who was going to drive his car into a nearby ravine but was stopped by his roommate, who dialed 911. When I began my assessment, the patient sobbed and began to open up about very difficult things happening in his life. In our conversation, I showed him that I genuinely cared for him and wanted the best for him. I stressed to him that he had immense value that wasn‚Äôt based on his current circumstances. Toward the end of the call, he thanked my crew for not treating him only ‚Äúlike a patient‚Äù but as a human being. After the call, I developed and implemented a framework and subsequent training that CU-EMS currently utilizes for compassionately assisting patients with mental health emergencies on our campus.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic shined a bright light on the healthcare disparities and inequalities rampant in today‚Äôs society. The pandemic did not adversely affect my application, but it heavily influenced my preparation and reinforced my motivation to become a physician. As an EMT, I treated countless COVID patients. These patients dialed 911 because they were in respiratory distress; however, around half of these patients were afraid to go to the hospital because they didn‚Äôt know how they were going to afford their treatment. This isn‚Äôt an uncommon concern today, but it was especially troubling because my patients‚Äô lives were in direct jeopardy. Patients should not have to struggle to express their concerns about affordable healthcare in between what could potentially be their dying breaths.

My parents often talk about the way I would sit as a toddler, mesmerized by the music playing on the CD player next to me, quickly becoming exasperated at the slightest interruption. My attachment only grew when I was able to create music myself. The first time I made a sound on my flute overwhelmed me; I couldn’t believe that my own breath had created the frequencies reaching my ears. I have studied piano, flute, and saxophone for the majority of my life. Music has always brought me immense joy and fulfillment. It is where I am most at peace.
With perspective, I now see that my early days of studying music were, in essence, for myself. Playing my instruments gave me a sense of accomplishment. In time, I learned that the gift of music was in fact a way to give something of myself for the benefit of others. In coming to this understanding, my relationship with music fundamentally changed. It was this awakened perspective that has also quite surprisingly been the catalyst for my pursuit of a career as a physician.
In my freshman year of college, I joined Tufts Public Harmony, a student group that performs music at retirement homes, shelters, and cancer centers. No longer was I just performing for family, friends, or ticket-holding audiences. At every concert, I was struck by music’s simple yet profound impact. As my group performed, audience members seemed to escape their struggles as the joy of the music reached them. I felt a deep sense of purpose in bringing this comfort to listeners. Public Harmony gave me the opportunity to use music as a vehicle for service, which cultivated my motivation to dedicate my life to healing. It is this same feeling that fuels my aspiration to be a doctor. In medicine as in music, I hope to provide relief to others. I embrace a sense of service in treating others with compassion, respect, and empathy.
I experienced this same call to service in my role with the Care Navigation team at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center. The patient population, primarily comprised of immigrants to the United States living below the poverty line, has been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The community needs were great and the resources scarce. My position, which involved connecting patients to aid such as food, clothing, and rental assistance, raised my awareness to their overwhelming needs and to the impact I could have, even on a small scale. My role grew more meaningful as I understood the value in the human connection that I could provide. Every phone call with patients was an opportunity to ease their burden just a little bit, even if that meant simply listening to their concerns. Contributing to this side of patient care strengthened my draw to medicine. As with the impact that I found in sharing my music, there is profound importance in being present for people in need.
Today, I am working as the clinical research assistant in the Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This role has allowed me to further take what I have learned about service, healing, and connection and combine it with my love of medical science. While I have always been fascinated by biology, so much of my identity growing up revolved around being a musician that I had not considered pursuing the medical field. This position has helped me solidify my passion for science through the lens of patient care. I get the privilege of experiencing the convergence of medical science and human connection on a daily basis by supporting patients through the process of receiving new treatment in clinical studies.
While I have been inspired by successful patient outcomes, I have also witnessed the frustrations of managing chronic disease. Working with the IBD physicians has raised my awareness about the disappointments inherent in practicing medicine. Sometimes treatments are not effective, leaving limited options. My biggest takeaway from these discouraging situations is the importance of validating the patients’ concerns while instilling confidence in the continued path of their care. I have developed great reverence for the role of clinicians as they navigate the highs and lows of caring for the vulnerable, and I deeply value the moments in my day when I am able to contribute to this care. Now in a clinical setting, just as I found with sharing my music, I am most fulfilled by being a source of trust and relief for others.
What draws me to medicine is the opportunity to serve at the intersection of science and human connection. The experiences that have guided me along my journey have revealed to me that I am most fulfilled when I am sharing my gifts for the sake of improving the lives of others. Music will always be one of my most cherished outlets; it brings me solace and keeps me balanced. However, it is through understanding the impact that music has when shared that I find purpose in providing comfort. While I have found different ways of fulfilling this purpose, my clinical work has confirmed to me that practicing medicine is where I would best be able to serve others. As I pursue medicine, I intend to dedicate myself to healing, service, and being present for those in need.","My experiences studying abroad in two different countries broadened my understanding of other cultures while also allowing me to empathize with its inherent discomforts. While studying in Spain, I lived with a host family. Adjusting to the environment of a new culture and trying to navigate an unfamiliar family dynamic all while only speaking Spanish was overwhelming at first. But despite the cultural differences, I ended up forming a beautiful and close relationship with the family. In Vienna, Austria, I studied privately under a professional Austrian flutist. Being mentored by someone from a different culture was a valuable learning experience for me. My teacher had philosophies, standards, and ways of giving feedback that were different from those of any of my American instructors. As a foreigner, I felt it was imperative for me to respect and learn from her customs. I got the most out of both experiences once I allowed myself to lean into the discomfort of the unfamiliar and adapt.","After attending high-risk obstetrics rounds at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, I became more aware of the lack of informational resources available to new and expecting mothers in this underserved patient population. I researched classes that were offered in the area, but none of them were taught in Spanish and few were geared toward a low-income audience. With the support of a grant, I designed a free series of workshops in Spanish for new and expecting mothers. While this was a small endeavor in the face of massive health disparities, the workshops made an impact on mothers in the community because they offered a space that was designed specifically for them to learn and connect with each other. The workshops enforced autonomy in healthcare and parenting, because access to the proper information allows for decision-making with confidence. At Rush, I hope to continue to use my resources to make an impact in the community by promoting patient empowerment and autonomy.",,,1,"I consider myself to be extremely lucky in the limited ways that the pandemic has impacted my plans and goals. The biggest challenge I faced was the shift in modality of most of my experiences from in-person to virtual. All of my classes were virtual from March of 2020 until I graduated in May of 2021, making it more difficult to access help from faculty or collaborate with classmates. Attending lab sessions online posed its own challenges; I had to learn how to grasp the concepts of the procedures without the opportunity to perform them myself. Additionally, my internship with the care navigation team at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center was switched to remote in the spring of 2020. Instead of meeting with patients for consults at the resource center like I had been doing, I was only able to make phone calls. Being remote made it more challenging to connect with patients and gain a complete understanding of their needs, especially since we were communicating in Spanish.",1,0,2
2023,15477964,,24,Woman,USA,0,,0,0,,U,0,1,"In preparation for the Cell Biology midterm my sophomore year, I created an extensive study guide that covered all class materials in great detail. During group study sessions leading up to the exam, my classmates and I discussed important concepts using my study guide as an outline. When taking the open-book, online exam, I utilized my study guide the best I could. However, this study guide was shared to the classmates I worked with, and I was naive to use the same study material on an exam that did not permit group-work. On two questions that asked about a specific concept that we had covered during the study sessions, my classmates and I had written an answer that was nearly identical to what was on my study guide. 

Ultimately, I was responsible for sharing my study guide with my classmates. Studying as a group is a valuable learning method, but it is a different story when that led to a gateway of cheating in an exam that strictly prohibited collaboration. I should have been aware that as an open-book exam, sharing a study guide was a risk factor for both myself and my fellow classmates. I pushed my boundaries to an extent I now realize I should not have, and it was an experience that fundamentally changed my mindset regarding the need to be more cognizant of my own behavior and those around me.",0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,4130,920.0,,830.0,1340.0,,1,830,1,1340,04/15/2023,Washington University in St. Louis,Cognitive Neuroscience,0,,Yes,No,Don't Know,"$75,000 - 99,999",4,1,1,0,0.0,85.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,25,Exceptional,4,2023,3,6.0,1.0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"I walked towards my fourth patient room in the intensive care unit at Barnes Jewish hospital, clutching my clipboard and iPad. As an undergraduate research assistant, my task was to visit patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass to assess potential symptoms postoperative delirium. Tightening the nose bridge of my K-94 mask and waving hello to the nurses by the monitoring desk, I took a deep breath and knocked. 

Rose was an 86-year-old woman suffering from severe heart problems and the side effects of an invasive surgery; she was exhausted and in pain. She refused an examination when I visited her earlier, sobbing and motioning for me to leave. Still anxious but feeling more prepared, I greeted Rose and approached her with a warm smile, releasing a breath of relief when she smiled back. I conducted the assessment slower than usual, frequently glancing up to check in on Rose’s condition. As soon as I wrapped up the questionnaire, Rose grasped my arm and said, “I’m so sorry about yesterday, dear.” Even though she was the patient helplessly in pain, Rose repeatedly apologized, explaining how her sickness debilitated her. While I was at a loss for words, her sister, Mary, handed me a jeweled keychain shaped like an angel that she had made throughout the weeks of Rose’s hospitalization and thanked me for my patience with Rose. My throat tightened under my smile as I walked out of the room, almost instinctively attaching the keychain to my lanyard. Their gestures of gratitude unveiled a new side of the patient experience in a setting of poor health and distress, leaving me dumbfounded.

Perhaps I was so unnerved by Mary’s kindness because of my experiences with my father’s illness. My father suffered a sudden brain hemorrhage and was in a coma for three months, gaining consciousness only to find complete paralysis of the right side of his body. Despite over twenty years of physical therapy, his footsteps are easy to distinguish because he now limps, his handwriting nearly illegible as he now writes with his left hand. But the most difficult thing for me and my family was his anger and violence whenever he was in pain. My mother would always remind us to consider the source of his rage, however irrational and frustrating, in order to communicate with him. Between each wince of pain he let out and the exasperated outburst that followed, I could see and finally begin to understand his reality as a chronic patient. My relationship with my father is a complicated one, but I am grateful for the challenging (albeit enlightening) times I spent witnessing his side of the patient experience.

While I have been prepared to address the realistic barriers to physical and mental health with patience and empathy, working at Total Access Urgent Care shaped me to be equally as sensitive and perceptive of a patient’s myriad of identities as I would be of their symptoms. During the peak of COVID-19, our team accommodated outrageous patient volumes despite the overwhelming lack of information regarding the pandemic while being short staffed. Every day, I took patients’ vital signs and asked the entry questions written on my clipboard, carrying on routine conversations. That is, until I met Brian.

“Have you had a fever in the last three days?” I habitually inquired. A seemingly simple question I have asked countless times, yet it already assumed so much. “I’m so sorry,” Brian said with uneasy laughter. His eyes darted towards the linoleum floor as he continued, “I can’t afford a thermometer, so I have no idea.” As I prescribed acetaminophen and injected IV fluids to Brian, who indeed had a high fever, I began to reevaluate the position I held in the clinic and what more I could do to provide relief to low-income patients like Brian.

With my own identity as a Korean American raised in Seoul, the strong education in the humanities I received, and experience aiding patients like Brian, the significance of the intersecting factors of identity carries a heavy weight on my back. My exposure to diverse patient populations in St. Louis communities reinforced the subtle implications of identity in medicine, especially its role in the social, physical, and biological determinants of health. As an aspiring physician, I can use my experiences to approach medicine through an intersectional lens, prioritizing foremost the patient’s reality and identity. I will approach each patient holistically and empathetically listen to their stories in order to serve them best.

The path to becoming a physician is a long one, but I can say with confidence that I am ready to begin the journey of a lifelong learner and a committed healer. The resilience and kindness I have seen in patients like Rose drive me towards becoming a physician worthy of their appreciation, and my father’s illness has ingrained in me a habit of learning and accommodating. I am ready to be challenged by difficult and unforeseen situations in the clinic — like Brian’s — because it is through these circumstances that I will learn and grow. I am ready to be a physician who not only has expertise in the medical field, but one who examines all personal identities and perceives the complexity of intersectionality when diagnosing and treating a patient.","As a Korean American raised in Seoul who attended a rigorous boarding school in Concord, Massachusetts from the age of 14, I firmly believe that my racial, cultural, and academic background set the solid foundation of who I am today. Attending a strict boarding school helped me accept criticism as constructive feedback and act accordingly to better my performance. I learned how to approach novel situations with patience, discover alternative solutions with independence, and embraced life-long habits of organization and efficiency. Adapting to an environment that accommodated a different culture, language, and behavioral standard shaped me to be flexible in every situation I find myself in. My interests in medicine began long before attending boarding school, but my experiences in cultural assimilation in New England and aiding diverse patient populations in St. Louis solidified my interests in global health, especially in recognizing and addressing impediments to inclusive healthcare.","During my undergraduate years, I found comfort in the small, close-knit campus environment that was referred to as ‚Äúthe bubble.‚Äù While the bubble felt reassuring, it troubled me that I knew so little about the community around me. To interact with the neighborhoods and populations of St. Louis, I decided to take initiative by participating in community service groups. _x000D_
 _x000D_
I began volunteering at Project Downtown St. Louis every weekend, where I helped prepare fresh, nutritious meals for the unhoused population in St. Louis. On one particular winter morning, as I was heating up chicken noodle soup, I realized that I could provide more warmth than one bowl of soup. As the student coordinator, I set up donation boxes throughout campus and dormitories to collect winter garments and blankets. As the president of my university‚Äôs chapter of Doctors Without Borders, I recruited volunteers to join me in donation rounds where we provided winter clothing along with the meal we prepared.",,,1,"In March of 2020, the intricate cogs that were working together to build my student life and career path were jammed to a stop. The time I spent at the Cerebral Palsy Rehabilitation Program came to a halt, as did every community service group I worked with. My onboarding process to begin research was paused and then canceled entirely until the next academic year. Finding myself with ample time, I pushed forward my start date to work at Total Access Urgent Care._x000D_

Despite the difficulties of navigating through a global pandemic, I realized that I was fortunate in many ways. As masks became available, I prepared warm meals for the unhoused population in St. Louis. As I became accustomed to a remote work environment, I volunteered as a text line counselor to provide relief to texters. After the tumultuous summer of 2020, I began research studying postoperative delirium. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to work as an essential healthcare worker during a time when my help was vital.",1,0,3

Sam was not only a longtime family friend, he had been my guide and mentor throughout my Nonproliferation and Terrorism graduate studies. Years spent as a CIA analyst had made him exceptionally wary of “government corruption” and skeptical of recommendations for vaccination against COVID-19. A few hours later, my mentor would become another pandemic victim. 

Since I was a child administering basic care, including vaccinations and assisting with deliveries, on my family's alpaca farm in Hagerstown Maryland, I have always had an interest in medicine. Enrolling at the University of Richmond, I started pursuing a pre-medical degree but following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, I became equally interested in global cultures and politics. The addition of my Russian Studies joint degree led to additional coursework, including a class where I designed a project on the Russian anti-plague surveillance system, which would eventually provide the seed for their biological weapons program. This burgeoning interest in how other peoples organize themselves in response to public health threats led me to study the intersection of science and national security in the Middlebury Institute of International Studies and the Moscow State Institute of International Relations dual degree program. Following graduation, I landed what I thought at the time was my dream job as a biological weapons counterproliferation analyst at a national laboratory. 

Early in my career, I believed intelligence to be the ideal way to utilize my joint passion for science and understanding people in service of my countrymen. However, over time I developed some moral misgivings about the nature of my work, feeling that I was not in a position to contribute directly to my community. As the pandemic raged outside the guarded walls of our compound, and while many of my pre-medical friends from school were on the front lines in various capacities, I was behind a gate chasing boogeymen. My work had exposed me to tropical and infectious disease research and emergency medicine preparedness, rekindling my love for hard science and leading me to reconsider my earlier decision to not pursue medical school.

The next step meant wholly letting go of who I was to become who I always wanted to be. I left my prized clearance role and accepted a position as a clinical research fellow at Cumberland Valley Retina Consultants (CVR). In my role, I assist with preparing patients for interocular treatment and coordinate two clinical research trials focusing on management of age related degenerative and diabetic eye conditions. It lacked the pay and pomp of my prior work, but I immediately loved the multitude of moments for human connection it afforded me. Be that redirecting an agitated dementia patient or calming a child before a surgical procedure, I became completely enamored with medicine’s vast capacity for good. 

My professional background also led to a volunteer position with the Red Cross Disaster Action Team as an on call responder for local disaster victims. Over the past year, I have been called to assist numerous victims of house and tent encampment fires, working to provide immediate financial relief, housing and other services. Victims like Sue, who’s ex-husband battled mental illness and in a fit of rage, set fire to her home, leaving her and her five year old son homeless. Sitting beside Sue to go through the options I could provide for food and shelter, she began to sob. Setting down the brochures I had put together for her, I placed my arm around her shoulder, reassuring her that we were going take care of her and her son and that they were not alone. “Thank you, I really needed to hear that,” she whispered as her sobs slowed. Sometimes, our best service comes in simply being present.

My years of study, research, and work in national security and counterterrorism honed my adaptability to new and challenging environments, often requiring me to master material in which I had little or no academic background. In these roles, I was consistently able to quickly rise and take on more responsibility than I was initially given. Skills including weighing competing hypotheses to analyze and determine relevance to the problem at hand, have translated well in my current clinical role. I also developed strong intercultural communication skills as a graduate student both here and in Russia presenting highly technical content to individuals from a multitude of backgrounds. Yet it has been my interactions with my patients at CVR and those like Sue, that continue to reaffirm my decision to return to my aspirations to become a physician. While the technical and scientific attributes embodied by a healthcare career will always pique my intellectual curiosity, it is the ability to provide comfort and compassion to others during what may be one of the worst days of their life that drives me. It is my hope to one day provide guidance to individuals like Sam, my mentor, to gain the trust needed to guide their healthcare decision process and to partner with those in need as part of the next generation of 21st century physicians.","‚ÄúYour eyes are green like mine!‚Äù Not the first words I expected from my new roommate, I soon learned that green eyes were rare in Anel's native Kazakhstan. Our backgrounds could not have been more different‚Äîwhere the Appalachians had towered over my childhood, Almaty's skyscrapers had hers. By pointing out our similarities, she was looking for a connection. Very different in our cultural upbringings, we frequently disagreed, particularly on topics relating to gender norms. However, her unabashed enthusiasm and non-judgmental attitude, coupled with her ability to discuss viewpoints from a genuine place of interest on both sides, blossomed into a deep friendship in that tiny Moscow flat. Anel taught me that looking for any tiny similarity, even green eyes, can connect us to those unlike ourselves. I still keep her grandmother‚Äôs chak chak recipe, scrawled on the back of a receipt, as a reminder of the time we shared and of my promise to visit her one day._x000D_
","Richmond Virginia's complicated racial past left lasting scars on its contemporary civil life. One of the most insidious issues I learned about from the schoolchildren I tutored was that of de facto school segregation. A desire to help further led me to Kristen Larson, former school board member running for city council on a platform of providing equal access to quality education. Using a work study scholarship, I joined her campaign as an unpaid intern. A core team of two, we canvassed hundreds of houses and engaged with the local community at events. In the end, we managed to unseat the establishment candidate on election day. Kristen taught me the basics of grassroots organization, how to maximize impact with limited resources, and that one highly motivated person can make a difference.

Then you better go catch it!” Making this prank call is typical behavior for a 14-year-old. Yet for 14-year-old “Cam” at Covenant House Florida (CHF), an under-21 homeless shelter where I spent two summers as a volunteer intern, the consequences were different. Because this harmless prank was against CHF rules, Cam was removed from one of his last housing options and separated from his brother, friends, and support network at CHF. 

I will never forget when I learned that Cam would be expelled. His absence raced through my mind the entire day, and when I checked out, I gave him a hug and assured him that he would be okay. Getting in my car to head home, I broke down in tears. I had studied poverty in my classes as a poverty studies minor, but its unfairness and inequity were not made tangible to me until that moment. The sadness and frustration of seeing Cam removed from CHF has lasted with me far beyond that day in July 2019, as the experience sparked a fire within me to fight for the vulnerable and work for justice in every interaction. My time at CHF was immensely important to my commitment to enter the medical field. I learned how to effectively communicate with the youth at CHF, a population who (not unlike those sick at a hospital) had undergone trauma and were skeptical of my ability or willingness to help them. My experiences there shaped in me an attitude of and ability to practice compassion. I gained confidence in meeting people at their most vulnerable state and working to alleviate their suffering, whether that be with the youth at CHF or the patients I hope to treat one day. I look forward to gaining even more experience working with vulnerable populations during my year of service beginning in August 2022, as a Social Work Assistant at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, MD. 

Catholic theologian James Keenan wrote that “Mercy is the willingness to enter into the chaos of another.” If this is the case, then perhaps no other vocation involves more mercy than being a physician. Entering the chaos of others is certainly an accurate way to describe some nights on duty as a Resident Assistant (RA). One particularly chaotic night stands out, where in a span of 30 minutes, a resident fell down the stairs and broke his tailbone, three parties had to be shut down, and a resident tearfully shared with me his struggles back home and in adjusting to college. Strangely, during the chaos of that night, I found a deep sense of fulfillment. I was entirely focused on the moments at hand, working to help the community I care so much about and doing what I could to ease the suffering of my residents. My time as an RA taught me what leadership and mercy truly is – sharing life with others and walking with them in both their joys and sorrows. My role gave me the unique privilege of being a friend, mentor, and resource to my residents, and made me a better leader. In walking with my residents throughout the year by mourning their losses, celebrating their successes, and helping them thrive in the dorm, I made a real impact in their lives. Being an RA has given me a small taste of the responsibility each physician has in engaging their patients at their most distressed times and serving as a trusted resource. 

Gaining a patient’s trust is perhaps the most important role of a physician. Trust was something I fully gave and received as a counselor at Camp Sweeney, a summer camp for children with Type 1 diabetes, in 2021. The campers there trusted me from the start to take care of their Type 1 diabetes and administer the proper corrections for their blood sugar. Yet they also trusted me to be their friend, an older brother, and a positive example in their life who will instill confidence in them to take on a disease as daunting as Type 1 diabetes, or any other challenge life throws at them. I realized this trust in “Adam”, a high school senior at the camp. Late one night, he told me that he could not believe how hard I worked to care for him. He said despite meeting me only a week ago, he viewed me as just as much of a positive role model as his father. It humbled me to think that the compassion I showed Adam in such a short time could lead to such a trusting relationship between us. Yet for the campers to trust me like Adam did, I had to trust my fellow counselors. Our days were long and packed with activities from 7am – midnight. After the campers went to bed, we cleaned the cabins, entered medical data, made lesson plans, and communicated with campers’ parents. We were sleep deprived and had to rely on each other in every way, and we were a team that functioned because we trusted each other. I will forever be grateful to the campers who taught me how to trust others and be trusted, and to the counselors who taught me how to work as a team under even the most difficult of circumstances.
            
In reflecting on my experiences over the past few years, I see that I have grown to love being present to help others in the chaos and suffering of their lives. At the heart of the patient-physician relationship is trust and compassion, and I hope that I can build off my experiences to continue to walk with others through their illness.","I knew the experiences of the youth at Covenant House Florida (CHF) would contrast mine, but I did not know how different we might appear to be. They were almost all Black or Latino; I was White and Asian. They often had a different primary language from English, ate different foods than me, and had cultural traditions and perspectives separate from my own. They had undergone trauma I could not imagine, and I had immense privileges that they had never experienced. _x000D_
_x000D_
Yet we were also remarkably similar. We were teenagers who grew up in South Florida and dealt with the same challenges of finding your place as an adolescent. In both the similarities and differences I found with the youth, I formed deep connections and learned that trusting relationships can be forged across cultural and socioeconomic differences through genuine care and a desire to better understand another. It is through this same care and desire to understand that I hope to connect with my patients._x000D_
","In Summer 2020, the worsening pandemic and the murder of George Floyd and its ensuing protests highlighted the deep systemic racism in our nation, and its effects ranging from health disparities to police brutality. _x000D_
_x000D_
During this difficult summer, seeking to make a positive impact in my community, I returned to CHF. I could not provide an answer to the youth about the injustice present in our world, but I could provide hope in small ways. I disinfected surfaces, led guitar classes, and started conversations that allowed the youth and I to process, together, the events of the summer. _x000D_
_x000D_
That summer, I realized that it is often small, everyday actions that are most impactful. As a physician, I will not be able single-handedly eliminate disparities in health or ensure access to quality care for everyone in the world, or even the US. However, I can do my part to show compassion and understanding to my patients, and to be attuned to their unique needs and circumstances. _x000D_
",,,1,"Though I struggled to adjust to online learning and the lack of in-person clinical opportunities, the pandemic also affected my view of medicine and my potential role in it. It brought to light the need for education and equity within the medical field and throughout society.

2023,15485159,,27,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"As a first-generation student of blue-collar immigrant parents who would later become citizens, I struggled with navigating my way through school. Throughout much of my adolescence, my father struggled with alcoholism and left me responsible for taking care of my younger sister every afternoon. At the time, my mother worked the swing shift, and I recall the conversations we'd share over the phone regarding my father's status and where he had been most of the night. I remember the feelings of defeat and embarrassment in the classroom the following day after failing to turn in my homework. I never prioritized school simply because I had other priorities at home. It wasn't until I had a child of my own that my father managed his addiction and stopped for good. By then, I managed to graduate high school even when half of my class did not.

These circumstances that I endured have taught me the value of a stable household and the impact that social and family dynamics can have on one's health.

The epidural had yet to take effect, and intensity filled the room. I tried to comfort my partner in any way possible, from physical touch to distraction, as she birthed our first child. After the first invasive attempt at an epidural, the anesthesiologist advised that she wait for the effects to “kick in”. However, only half of her lower body was numb. The physician returned, performed the procedure a second time and within moments, her pain and suffering was instantly alleviated. Her anxiety had subsided, and the screams were replaced by the cries of our newborn baby boy. It amazed me how the physician was able to manipulate the physiology of the human body beyond the cognitive aspect with the use of medicine to allow for such a beautiful moment to surface. This ultimately led to my transition from envisioning myself counseling in an office, to one day counseling patients at the bedside. 

Initially, I gravitated towards the field of counseling, specifically regarding addiction and substance use. In my youth, I was convinced that alcohol use in the home was the norm. Growing up, I recognized that my father fulfilled the characteristics of a high-functioning alcoholic. I vividly remember playing in the rocks outside of my father’s AA meetings and standing at his bedside when doctors explained that he was nearing liver failure. I often wonder what would have become of my father if he had not sought addiction treatment. Witnessing this disease take its toll on my father, as well as the patients that I frequently encountered in the various mental health facilities around town, allowed me to recognize that treating addiction lies beyond the behavioral aspect. 

As a Latino student, in addition to school, I navigated my way through construction sites to provide for my family while juggling the demands of fatherhood. I quickly realized that a strong work ethic doesn’t always translate well into academic success. As a first-generation, I struggled to maintain the balance between these various roles, and my grades suffered as a result. I realized that in order to achieve my goals in medicine, education needed to take priority, a decision that ultimately resulted in my growth. I began to shape my day around school, rather than shape my day around work; I began dedicating specific time to spend with my kids, forcing me to be productive during my allocated study time. I applied myself and as a result, I fostered academic success through critical thinking and self-discipline. 

During this time, I also immersed myself in healthcare as a mobile phlebotomist. I found myself surrounded by hundreds of experiences and anecdotes that were not my own. Over the years of working with the incarcerated, low-income, psychiatric, homeless, disabled, and Latinx communities throughout Southern Nevada, I made it a habit to form personable connections with patients. I recall a time with a Hispanic patient named “Angel” whose labs I routinely drew. Angel was suffering from cancer and a terminal diagnosis; he expressed how isolated and lonely he felt, partly due to a lack of communication. Anticipating his mortality and fearing mechanical conventions would replace his physiological functions, I was able to provide him with familiarity in a foreign environment through our shared native language. I sought to provide him with comfort and intimacy as he spent his remaining days in a single-room hospital bed. 

When my mother suffered a debilitating back injury from a car wreck, she expressed similar feelings of isolation during her lengthy hospital stay. This event, along with my clinical experiences, also illuminated the health disparities that exist in medicine, particularly in regard to linguistic and cultural differences. I felt privileged to share in some of the most intimate moments of people’s lives, as I had done with Angel, even if I was only there to fulfill a laboratory task. I took advantage of my role to form relationships with patients, sharing laughs with the patients and their families and creating a more human experience. This furthered my desire to provide a personal approach to healthcare with my future patients and to improve their quality of life. 

Ultimately, my experiences within the Las Vegas community allowed me to recognize that genetic, environmental, and physiological contributing factors all complicate the treatment of chronic diseases. In my clinical experiences, I have had the opportunity to improve communication by mitigating language barriers in healthcare. I recognize that limiting myself to cognitive treatment in counseling would leave me unfulfilled, as I seek to treat the entire person, as I witnessed physicians do during the birth of our first child. I aim to deepen my understanding of the disease processes as a diverse physician, serving the vulnerable communities that surround me. My passion for counseling plays a significant role in my bedside manner, and I truly believe that the opportunity of a medical education would give me the platform to fulfill my ambitions as a physician, especially in the many intersections of care within medicine.","I met my mentor during my undergraduate education, who invited me to join her research lab. I was immersed with people of varying backgrounds and identities in an academic setting. Until then, I had only drawn blood from a diverse population and worked with other Hispanics in construction. I was provided the opportunity to engage and learn about the increasing hardships other minority groups faced. During a meeting, the leader asked us a question about the results of our study. I voiced my opinion only to discover that others did not agree with me and that I may have been wrong in my assumptions. Although my answer was based on my experiences, I never considered how their diverse experiences may have been different. I know now that when diverse individuals are allowed to collaborate, we are also given the opportunity to challenge assumptions and biases. I gathered a multicultural awareness from this group and learned to compromise when others provided a perspective different from mine.","My experiences in the Las Vegas community have shown me the importance of compassionate care and increasing representation in healthcare. There have been plenty of instances where I was the only Spanish-speaking person in the hospital. I am reminded of the opportunities I have had to translate and interpret for those in my community, including my parents. As a phlebotomist, medical scribe, and Spanish interpreter, I have communicated the needs of those with limited English proficiency while breaking down the barriers that would otherwise result in poorer health outcomes. As a representative of the Latinx community, I recognize that I am uniquely positioned to educate and advocate for individuals within the Latinx and immigrant populations with whom I can relate on a cultural and socioeconomic level. I hope to showcase my experiences gained in Southern Nevada early on at Rush Medical College, specifically caring for those experiencing inequities in healthcare on the West Side of Chicago",,,1,"As a healthcare worker prior to the pandemic, I recall feeling a sense of guilt while drawing a patient's blood as they physically declined. Meanwhile, their family was forced to stand outside the window, attempting to communicate with them. Having only met the patient for a few minutes, I became their liaison with the outside world. Even while mouthing words through the glass, I felt I was stealing precious moments away from their family members as they took their last few breaths. The protocols during the pandemic made for difficult times within the healthcare realm, but I found meaning in my service to these patients. My guilt had transformed into feelings of gratitude. Outside the hospital, childcare opportunities dwindled for long stretches due to COVID-19, and the research opportunities and undergraduate courses I was involved in had transitioned into a remote setting. Thankfully, with the help of community programs, we continue to manage through this hardship.",1,0,2

I remember one day, sitting in the waiting room of an unfamiliar doctor’s office. We were waiting on my sister, who was having a minor surgery. It seemed to last an eternity. When the surgeon emerged calling for us, everything moved so quickly as the next thing we knew, we were told that my sister has an advanced form of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and needs to be admitted to the hospital immediately for treatment. I recall the brief moment I was able to see her, still unsure about what was happening. 

All through this calamity, I was able to see the dedication and diligence of the doctors who tirelessly worked to save her life. I was filled with hope and determination as the medical team devoted themselves to her care, while also uplifting my mother, father, and us siblings. Through them, we were able to steal as many precious moments as we could to be by her side. As she improved, they celebrated with us – every encouraging test result was as much of a joy for them as it was for us. For that time, her doctors were a part of our family. Seeing all they did for her, and the relationships they built with my family helped me realize my calling. The day we received the news that she was in remission was the day I decided that I wanted to become a doctor. 

As much of a driving force this motivator was, I soon learned that the real challenges and hard work that I would have to persevere through in pursuing this profession were ahead of me. I have been fortunate to have a bit of medicine in my family as my uncle, a cardiothoracic surgeon, has been a great help. His guidance led to volunteer opportunities and shadowing experiences early on in my journey. In 7th grade I thought I may want to go into cardiothoracic surgery; so, we set up some time over a break for me to come to shadow him. Despite being only 13, the entire staff treated me as if I were a serious medical student. I followed him throughout his day, standing by his side as he performed surgeries. Being so close to the operations was thrilling, but also shocking. During the first surgery, I had to step aside and sit down, as the smell and the warm climate were making me nauseous. A nurse brought me water, and for a moment, I contemplated leaving. I knew I was getting a great opportunity, so, despite this minor hindrance, I returned to my post and watched attentively the rest of the surgery and those that followed. I never had to step away for the rest of the day. While I made it through, the thought of leaving and going back to comfort was tempting. I know that medicine presents many challenges, but I learned I can face and overcome them by setting aside discomfort to learn. Not wanting to go home empty-handed, my uncle and I collected some research on the heart and its function that I later presented to my family. While I did not receive a grade for my un-assigned project, it still hangs on the wall of my bedroom as one of the proudest moments of my childhood.

For much of my time in high school, I volunteered in the cancer ward at my local hospital. Today, my sister is as strong as ever, and the opportunity to help other families has been a motivator for my volunteer work. In the beginning, I worked a general role, providing support for staff and families. I gathered lunch or coffee or whatever was needed for the families whose blank expressions mirrored those of my family as we waited on my sister. I knew small things such as a magazine or someone to listen with a smile could break the monotonous daily lives of the families in such moments of hardship. Most days I stayed much longer than what I was scheduled for, as comforting others doesn’t stop at the end of a shift. My commitment was noted as families often spoke to my supervisor about my dedication to their aid. While I have pursued other opportunities since my time there, I still visit the ward on my school breaks to aid in any way I can. I often come to help train new volunteers in the unit. Learning to lead a synchronized team, ensure the utmost commitment from the volunteers through accountability, and continue to help emotionally provide for families has helped me build my leadership skills and further develop empathy. The unit I volunteered at was awarded the hospital’s Excellence award, which still leaves me smiling today.

With this experience, I’ve also learned that not all stories have a happy ending and that my family’s experience was very fortunate. My contribution was meaningful, but also difficult. I have had to wrap my arms around weeping mothers, who were forced to say goodbye to a life’s worth of hopes and dreams. I have seen patients with positive outlooks take a devastating turn for the worse. With this, I have learned that in this life, nothing is certain, things can change in an instant, for better and for worse. It is the families that have the strength to push on, and the caring medical staff that inspire me to contribute in any way I can to advance change in the right direction. To make these great, meaningful changes, I must become a physician.","My time volunteering and the Halim Clinic has broadened my world views. Its mission is to provide effective, quality care to those unable to afford treatment by focusing on a patient-centered, outcome-based, and cost-effective approach to medicine. The clinic is a Muslim initiative and many of the patients are Arabic-speaking. This has presented me with a great opportunity to learn and care for people unlike myself, as I am not Muslim and do not speak Arabic. In this setting, I learned to care for people while respecting their culture, making sure they are comfortable and that a respectful relationship is maintained. I also learned how to effectively communicate despite the language barrier. Here, I used creative means to ensure a mutual understanding between the patient and myself. Understanding that each patient interaction is unique, this taught me the importance of varying approaches to patient care to best fit each patient‚Äôs cultural, emotional, and physical needs.","During COVID, I worked as a caregiver in an assisted living facility. Our community was on lockdown which restricted residents to their rooms, limiting face-to-face interactions. While this was done for their safety, it made for a lonely environment. The only interactions residents had were with us caregivers who helped them throughout the day. I made sure to spend as much time as I could interacting with each resident, but with over 100 residents, my time was short with each. I had an idea to connect the residents together to emulate life before COVID. Each room had an iPad for the residents, so for those interested, I installed Zoom and connected them together. Many who were hesitant would join later when they heard laughter and joy from the rooms next door. I was able to make this uncertain time a little more comfortable by connecting the residents, making all the difference for the morale of the community.",,,1,"The COVID pandemic has impacted and changed the way I approach my education. With the switch to remote learning, I learned to become more independent in my education by having to do outside research on topics that challenged me. Prior to this, I could ask a question in class or directly speak to my peers, but with online classes, I was without these immediate resources. At first, this was challenging, as it is easy to get lost in the vast amount of information online. After some time, however, I became efficient in finding and applying the information to continue to do well in my exams and classes. This quick adaptation helped me in my medical school preparation by allowing me to truly learn the material in my undergraduate classes that are the foundation of what is needed to succeed in medical school. I also became better at independent learning, which in conjunction with collaboration, has helped me maximize my learning.",1,0,2

As someone who has dedicated his life to others, he has become my biggest inspiration. From a young age, I have been exposed to the various roles of a physician. The first role is as a healer. My father is a pediatrician, and seeing him return a child in a better state than they arrived at the hospital taught me the most pivotal role a physician has. The second role is as an educator. Watching my father sit down and talk to his patients, the patient’s families, and even our own extended family revealed to me the collective role a physician has in their community. The third role, and not the last, is as an empathizer. I have seen how important it is for my father to sit down with patients, make a connection with them, answer their questions and learn about their ailments, diagnose them, and eventually see them through their treatment. All in all, the pursuit of a profession that serves simultaneously as a healer, an educator, and an empathizer in a community has driven me to dedicate my life to the betterment of others.

My father served as a spark in pursuing a career in healthcare; this initial spark has only been reaffirmed through my various clinical experiences in the healthcare setting. In particular, in high school, while volunteering at a local hospital, I remember a patient named “Delilah”. She had cancer, and she was visibly sick and frail. However, for some reason, she had a smile on her face and was dancing to the song “Happy” by Will Pharrel. With my careful ear, I was able to hear that she was on track to start a new cancer treatment. I was later able to sit down bedside next to her. She told me about previous treatments that were unsuccessful, and that her biggest motivation to continue persevering was to make it to her daughter’s wedding in the coming summer. In medical school, I am eager to learn the foundations of the body, how and why things go wrong, and the various treatments patients depend on. 

A few weeks later, I ran into Delilah again. This time, she was hysterically crying. The latest round of her treatments had prevented her cancer from metastasizing. She was crying tears of joy. Seeing her patient experience, and the diligence of her surrounding healthcare team, taught me the personal side of medicine. Physicians are leaders in the hospital setting, and have an enormous impact on patients' lives and their families. I cannot wait to be a part of that.

	In college, I continued my clinical experience as a medical assistant at a pediatric clinic and as a health scholar at a couple hospitals. What I took from these experiences was that there are inequalities in access to healthcare, and there are disparities in how people trust healthcare and those that practice medicine. Many are reluctant to go to the hospital due to costs and the inability to understand their treatment. Additionally, many have many reasons why they delay treatment, which may lead to chronic disease. As a physician, I am eager to break down some of the many barriers in accessibility to healthcare. I strive to take care of patients who know I care, trust my recommendations, and leave my care with a positive regard as it pertains to the healthcare system. 

It will be a great privilege to practice medicine. Having been inspired by my dad, and reaffirming those aspirations through clinical volunteering and employment, I have come to learn the importance a physician has in the clinic. I hope to heal, educate, and empathize with those in need, and advocate for the marginalized as to mitigating the indirect inequities that have resulted in the practice of medicine. I hope to be a resource to those who do not fully understand their treatments, and allow them to live happy, safe, and healthy lives. Medical school will be just another step in my journey to take care of, inform, and provide others with a sense of security, just as my father has with his patients.","As a second-generation Egyptian immigrant, I have always been regarded as unique. I also practice a faith unfamiliar to many others, and my family comes from a Muslim country. I am Middle Eastern, and those around me are as different as I am. In healthcare, these differences manifest themselves in many ways, and I can draw on my life experiences to contribute to a medical community that seeks to cater to the many needs of those it aims to provide care for._x000D_

Throughout my clinical, research, and volunteering experiences, as well as my undergraduate education, l have always worked with people different from myself to achieve goals. I have also always gone out of my way to learn about those around me. At Rush, I will contribute to the culture of collaboration in the community because I have learned to appreciate people different from myself.","Working at a food bank has exposed me to the inequities faced in the community and the need to provide the underserved with proper resources, including health care. Barriers in access to affordable food, transportation, and health care services make it difficult for underserved communities to live a healthy life. Working as a medical assistant in Palmdale, a medically underserved area, also brought my attention to the necessity of health services for everyone. I am thankful for the opportunity to reach these communities and do what I can to lessen their difficulties. However, there is still much more to be done. As a medical student and future physician I will be able to do more to improve the health of underserved communities._x000D_

This visible vulnerability took me by surprise, and although her disappointment struck me deeply, I was at a loss for how to console her. Should I cater to her jesting nature and distract her with jokes? Or was this a time where she simply needed a hug? As she looked woefully up at me, I knew that although I was not able to change her situation, my presence and companionship would help ease her disappointment.

Sam was too old and too smart to be easily redirected from her sorrow. Softly, I broached the subject. With tears in her eyes, Sam told me about how much she wanted to be like the other kids, just for once. She was embarrassed that even at a camp for sick kids she was still too ill to be with the rest of the pack. There was nothing that I could say to reverse her sorrow, but I did my best to help her through the gloom, acknowledging her sorrow, validating her feelings, and expressing my friendship. By the end of the morning, we had caught 12 fish, including the biggest sunfish Sam had ever seen. Sam did not need a fleet of boats to make her morning bright, she needed to be heard, understood, and celebrated for who she was. As we walked back to the cabin after a vibrant, slimy morning, Sam held my hand tightly, and smiled quietly.

Throughout that summer, I was not only challenged to care for many campers' physical needs, but also to comfort those who resented and feared their conditions and encourage them in their abilities. Before working at The Painted Turtle, I considered myself a supportive, caring, and empathetic person. However, after spending a summer of tough conversations, hospital visits, and midnight bathroom fiascos, I found that my natural empathy needed to be molded and honed into something more powerful--compassion in action. As I began to stretch and flex my empathy into compassion it became more and more natural for me to relate to campers, to anticipate their needs, and most importantly to create a space that allowed them to communicate what they needed to say.

I did not always have the perfect line to reverse despair, but I left camp at the end of the summer proud of the ways that I had challenged myself to grow as a caregiver. The Painted Turtle changed my understanding of what it meant to be an excellent physician, but shadowing Dr. Raju in Gastroenterology provided witness to this in a new way.

Prior to shadowing Dr. Raju, my exposure to clinical settings strictly encompassed either pediatric or geriatric patients, so this experience gave further insight into life as a physician. As I followed Dr. Raju from one appointment to the next, I found that unlike at camp or even in Family Practice shadowing, Dr. Raju saw adult patients ranging from people who were completely comfortable getting routine procedures to people who had wasted their organs with drinking and smoking to people who were even aggressive and rude during their visits. I was impressed to see that Dr. Raju went above and beyond for his patients regardless of their past interactions.

One patient in particular came in for a routine colonoscopy. Unlike most other patients, this patient was exceptionally rude, repeatedly insulting Dr. Raju in front of the other team members. Rather than let this individual’s actions affect him, Dr. Raju continued to treat this patient the same way as his other patients--speaking with them and addressing them in a respectful manner while maintaining professionalism by being assertive when necessary. While this impressed me, I was truly humbled when I saw Dr. Raju continue to take the extra time and care with this patient necessary to check and double check every wall of the colon. Dr. Raju showed me that true compassion in medicine goes beyond simply doing what you can for a doe-eyed child, it can be tedious--repeating a procedure for the thousandth time. It can be trying--working with patients who manifest their fears through aggression. And it can be frustrating--watching as patients disregard medical advice.

Although I am not yet a physician, I see a similar parallel in my tutoring interactions. Many students can be apathetic, cynical, and even verbally abusive. In my three years of tutoring and mentoring, I have seen how differently people react to challenges and uncertainty. I have learned to adapt to these situations, and I have discovered how to help students find the tools to express themselves. By connecting what I learned in my camp and shadowing experiences to my past three years of tutoring, I have honed the skills necessary to become someone worthy of wearing the medical badge. I hope to continue building on this foundation of compassion through a medical education that makes me both more knowledgeable and more human.
In the past four years, my understanding of what it means to be an excellent physician has evolved. Without the ability to turn empathy into compassion and compassion into communication, prescriptions and instructions fall flat. At a time when public faith in science is being put to the test, I want to be a physician that restores hope, communicates genuinely, and earns patient trust.","From going to Polka festivals to speaking Croatian with my grandma, I have always enjoyed embracing my culture and learning about people‚Äôs cultures; however, it was not until working at The Painted Turtle, a summer camp for children and teens with serious illnesses, that I saw how medical conditions could create a culture of their own. _x000D_
As summer began, the week for campers with skeletal dysplasia was my first real introduction to how blind I was to what life with a serious medical condition included. As I got to know the girls in my cabin, I saw their extensive and vibrant community. I had always thought of culture as mostly driven by ethnic traditions, but these middle schoolers from all over the United States were united by their medical condition. This experience showed me that the role of a physician involves more than knowing how to treat an illness: it is knowing how to treat the patient-- recognizing that their experiences make them who they are.","When I began tutoring at Waco High School, I found that many of the students were in need of not only tutoring, but also of attention, motivation, and most importantly, praise for what they could do. Many of the students were impressed with my status as a college student, and as their tutor, I worked hard to connect with my students and demonstrate that I was once in their very shoes struggling with the exact same concepts. As the weeks went by, it was extremely satisfying to see the transformations that ensued. While these students may not remember me or even what I taught, I believe that giving them a positive interaction with learning has helped to improve their perception of themselves and their abilities. As I prepare to spend my gap year teaching middle school science, I hope I will be able to continue helping my students learn course material while gaining confidence in themselves and appreciation for their abilities.",,,1,"As an undergraduate student, I had planned on joining Dr. Law‚Äôs research lab which looks into the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in cancer cachexia.

2023,15488133,,26,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"My path to college was filled with barriers from financial hardship to parents that never attended college. I attended a high poverty high school with 48.5% of students classified as socioeconomically disadvantaged and minority enrollment of 84%. I qualified for the free lunch program since my family’s income was below 130% of the federal poverty guideline and eligible for food stamps when I applied. I never had money to hire a tutor or buy test prep courses. Not deterred, I worked harder.

When applying for college, I was creative. I researched and emailed admissions for fee waivers and sat down with the scholarship book and applied to every one I thought applicable. In total, I received 11 scholarships. I negotiated with one college on tuition price and had my aid increased by 50%. I commuted 3 hours daily to downtown LA since I could not afford to live and eat on campus. While classmates paid thousands on tutors, I self-studied for classes and had a job to pay for books.

Waving goodbye to my father as he left home, my ears were pierced minutes later by a deafening bang followed by a chilling silence. Sprinting outside, my eyes were met by the sight of mangled metal. Leaving the neighborhood, his car had been hit by a truck that ran the red light. Minutes later, police, ambulances, and fire trucks arrived. In the chaos, I was helpless. Dazed, I watched the EMTs treat my dad. Inspired, I enrolled in an EMT course the next summer. I never wanted to feel as helpless as I did that day. Soon enough I was practicing emergency medicine in my college community. Each patient represented a complex puzzle that required swift problem-solving and recall of scientific knowledge.

The transition to college and commuting was difficult as reflected in my grades. My dad was prematurely forced into early retirement my freshman year from his warehouse job due to the liability of him having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral artery disease, and deep vein thrombosis. During the 6 months it took to receive his pension, our family had no income. I looked for a stable job, earned money on the side for gas from tutoring, and attended classes. I experienced the lowest grades of my academic career. It seemed easier to give up, but I persisted. I wanted to prove to myself that I could come back from disappointment and learn more about subjects that fascinated me. It was only a small part of making me stronger, but it begged the most obvious question, why study the human body and medicine?

The answer came unexpectedly and more abruptly than my initial introduction to medicine. In my final year of graduate school, my father suffered a stroke, an occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, leaving him paralyzed and unable to care for himself. Hearing the neurologist explain over the phone what brain regions were affected, I recalled the anatomical regions I studied while brain tracing MRI data in my research. There were so many variables to consider, and they couldn’t say for sure if his speech or motor movements would improve. Only that they recommended a nursing home. That was unacceptable to me. It was the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no vaccine and constant reports of disturbingly high nursing home fatality rates and severe staff shortages. There was no assurance of when or if I would ever see him again with a no visitor policy. He wouldn’t be able to call or text in his state. It was then my family made a decision. Upon his discharge, I took on the role of caregiver and advocate. This role has become my greatest challenge.

Returning home, help was limited and costly. I navigated performing rehabilitation with him each day, monitoring alcohol and nicotine detoxification and withdrawal symptoms. I assisted in daily activities such as bathing or putting on a shirt. Knowledge from my courses in motor control helped me to work with him to rehabilitate gross and fine motor skills from being able to sit up to forming a fist grip. What I didn’t know, I scoured journals, queried my professors who were physicians during office hours, and sought support from people that had taken the caregiver role.

Working in emergency medicine, I had only fleeting contact with my patients. I’d stop a bleed or administer naloxone, but then release them home or to a hospital. I wasn’t responsible beyond a narrow scope in time for mainly physical issues with tangible solutions. My clinical work didn’t prepare me for the complex emotional and mental problems of a rather grumpy and at times unmotivated patient that was my father. Medications and physical therapy did not address the emotional and mental anguish. He represented a complex medical puzzle requiring a solution that skillfully intertwined the physical, psychological, and spiritual. I discovered how integrative medicine does amazing things, and it was exciting for me to discover the right mix. Each day was exhausting but rewarding with its small victories. By transitioning to the online environment due to the pandemic, I was able to balance being a student, daughter, and caregiver. I had a 4.0 GPA in my final semester despite the many roles I played.

Medicine took on a new meaning and depth. It became more than my class lectures or applying a tourniquet. It’s multidimensional, requiring an all-encompassing solution relying on constant curiosity, problem-solving, and teamwork. It was empowering and rewarding to experience the impact my care had on my father. He has not only begun walking again but is now sober, experienced a weight loss from 258 to 192 pounds, and more connected to our family than ever. Looking back, it would have been so easy to put him in a nursing home. But that’s not who I am. It would have been a waste of my knowledge and skills.

Through this all, my greatest challenge has become my greatest achievement. As my world shifted under my feet, I matured, grew stronger, and became an advocate. Beyond the unique challenge that comes with solving a patient’s unique medical dilemma, my life experiences have solidified my desire to practice medicine to experience the true reward of its effects on a patient, their life, their families, and their caregivers.","Advocacy at the intersection of health and social care I believe is of the utmost importance and caring for a disabled father, I have learned to effectively advocate on someone else‚Äôs behalf. From navigating, submitting and receiving Disability Benefits for my father and a neighbor with severe Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, I have fought an HOA board for accessible parking and common areas and advocated for the rights of an abused disabled friend. These experiences provided me with the tools to be a compassionate and effective advocate._x000D_

Spending hours researching disability rights and laws, I am mindful of how much more I have to learn from and about the disabled community. I am committed to understanding and showing empathy for communities outside my own and will strive to continue this practice in my future as a physician. I am committed to adapting to new and differing points of view and lifestyles. I am confident that with my diverse experiences, I will bring my valuable perspective to RMC.","Never will I forget the first time I was faced with the reality of existing inequalities working in medicine. Receiving the dispatch, I was thrilled but nervous to finally put my EMT training and textbook knowledge to practical use. The dispatch was for fainting, a syncopal episode. By the time my partner and I arrived, the man regained consciousness. After assessing his stability, I probed him for information pertaining to his past medical history. Apprehensive, the man explained that he did not have access to routine medical care and could not afford the medication he was supposed to take. This was my first real lesson about the complex dilemma of inadequate healthcare access within my community and the critical health equity gap. As a volunteer EMT in Los Angeles, I was able to give back to my community and improve community health from stopping bleeds to blood pressure screenings. I deeply desire to continue to impact my community directly as a physician in my future career.",,,1,"As a Global Medicine master‚Äôs student, I was unable to travel and obtain clinical experience abroad during COVID-19. The immersive nature of the program was pivotal in influencing my decision to apply during my junior year of my undergraduate education._x000D_

Additionally, I ultimately made the difficult decision to take leave from my job as a first responder after weighing the risk to my household members that were diagnosed with respiratory issues. It was a difficult personal decision to balance my sense of duty to my family and my duty as a healthcare provider. The lack of health-related resources available during the crisis allowed me to problem solve for my father when he became physically disabled in the middle of the pandemic. Caring for him along with assisting other family members such as my grandmother and helping my nieces with their online coursework truly broadened my awareness of the variety of challenges brought on by the pandemic and I felt a duty to help where I was able.",1,1,2

As soon as I mentioned Abdul’s name, however, his eyes lit up. He quickly interjected to ask about Abdul’s healthcare policies, noting his persistent issues with Crohn’s disease. Within just a few minutes, I discovered that John was living paycheck to paycheck, and in many cases he had to choose between paying for his next meal or receiving care for his chronic illness. 

My appreciation for the gravity of healthcare was solidified during my time volunteering for Abdul’s campaign in the summer of 2018. Speaking with voters throughout Metro Detroit, I learned about the prominence of healthcare access as an issue for many Americans. As I traveled from neighborhood to neighborhood, I found that John’s struggles were not an exception to the rule – they defined it. During my time on the campaign, I faced a harsh truth: of the voters I spoke to, the ones who expressed the most significant reliance on the healthcare system were also those who faced systemic disparities affecting their care. Whether due to prohibitively costly medication or poor medical literacy, there is a cyclical nature to the cause of these health problems and the inability to properly address them, which eventually leads to even further health decline. 

Empowered by my time with Abdul’s campaign, I joined Opportunities to Educate Children, a student-organization dedicated to tutoring underprivileged children in Washtenaw County. As a tutor, I had the chance to form long-term relationships and play a role in the growth of others. In particular, my experience with Gavin, an eighth grader I tutored in algebra, opened my eyes to the impact of serving others. While seeing his increased understanding of algebraic concepts was rewarding, I found the most satisfaction in the connection I was able to form with him as his tutor. Whether I was demonstrating how to graph slope-intercept functions or advising him on his March Madness bracket, I always felt fulfillment in strengthening the bond I had with him and in turn becoming a better mentor. 

Throughout these varied experiences, it became clear to me that I could best serve my community by merging my desire for interpersonal connection with my deep interest in advancing health access and equity as a physician. I decided to pursue an opportunity as a medical scribe to further my clinical exposure, while attempting to grasp the true lifestyle of a physician first-hand. While scribing in an outpatient urology clinic, I witnessed the long-term relationships physicians create with their patients as well as the larger impact medicine can have. This was exemplified by the relationship between a patient, “Alex Smith”, and his urologist Dr. Kernen. Following Alex’s diagnosis with prostate cancer, he was heartbroken that he would not be able to complete his upcoming goal of running a marathon. Dr. Kernen, also a runner, was determined to help Alex recover and accomplish his goal. Following several months of treatment, he was finally able to train for a marathon and eventually completed this marathon side-by-side with Dr. Kernen himself. 

In observing cases like Alex’s, my desire to pursue medicine was further reaffirmed. While the impact of treating and relieving patients of their physical ailments cannot be understated, I believe the bonds formed through service are equally powerful. Similar to my experience with Gavin, Dr. Kernen’s impact on Alex went beyond their time in the clinic and the operating room. Stories like Gavin’s and Alex’s are not merely coincidental; they are linked by a common theme of service, which enables the growth and sustainability of these relationships.

My desire to become a doctor did not occur as a lightbulb moment; rather, it took place through a myriad of experiences, each one of which strengthened the previous. While my curiosity for science and service drove me to seek these opportunities, it was my involvement with individuals like John and Gavin which constantly brought me back to medicine. Through medicine, I have found an avenue to explore the intersection between my scientific interest in healthcare and forming the interpersonal connections that drive personal and communal growth. Whether through my experiences in the clinic or in my community, I feel assured that medicine is the most sacred and fulfilling form of providing service. It would be a privilege to become a physician, and I look forward to a lifetime of serving my community, one patient at a time.","Throughout my time working in urban communities I have gained an appreciation for the necessity of providing primary care. As a research assistant in Emergency Medicine throughout various Detroit hospitals, I have observed the issues associated with a lack of access to a primary care physician. In many cases, these patients end up in the emergency department after episodes of acute problems that could have been avoided if their health needs had been previously addressed. As a result, they develop chronic issues that otherwise could have been avoided. While in the emergency department patients can receive treatment for any imminent threats to their health, but this may only paper over the cracks of much more complex issues. For this reason, many patients are forced to frequently visit the emergency room out of necessity as health problems continue to arise.","Ann Arbor has given me a home to live in and a community full of support throughout my undergraduate years. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, I was desperate to find a way to give back to my community during such trying times. When I found Opportunities to Educate Children (OEC), an organization where I could virtually tutor children in Washtenaw County, I jumped on the opportunity. For many children, their educational access was hampered by the pandemic, one of many detrimental effects faced by underprivileged communities. _x000D_

I found spending my time helping others ignited my interest in a career in service. While I faced many inconveniences due to the pandemic, I am aware that for many the implications of the pandemic were much more life-altering. Implicit in the role of a doctor is putting the needs of others in front of yours, no matter the background of a patient, and our responsibility of giving back to others less fortunate is only amplified during such an unprecedented time.",,,1,,1,0,1

By a “grown-up,” she meant transferring patient care over to a doctor. Of course, I understood exactly what she meant. A patient with an urgent medical condition deserves the attention of a medical professional with far more training than I currently have. But as I scribbled that quote in my notes amid diagrams of pneumothoraces, I knew that I would not be satisfied as an EMT-Basic. I had enjoyed my time away from school, but I was ready to become a “grown-up” myself.

The past several years of my life have been filled with many medical and outdoor experiences. As a break from the pre-med college life, I spent my summers leading groups of Boy Scouts on rugged canoeing expeditions in the Boundary Waters of northern Minnesota. The work was tough, as some of these teenagers had never traveled a waterway more complex than your average lazy river. But after a few initial days of patiently coaching paddle technique and praying that the boats stayed upright, I was always pleased to see my Scouts catch on and shoot across lakes with a vengeance. By the end of the trip, I would be tired, smelly, and absolutely brimming with pride. I found a similar experience with my other outdoor education roles, as I helped youths overcome initial hesitations to later have fantastic and affirming experiences rock climbing or ocean kayaking. I’ve learned plenty from my outdoor jobs, from fire-building to astronomy navigation, but the most important lesson has been that of servant leadership. 

I have always carried this broad life goal of wanting to bring about positive change in the world, and as an outdoor guide I realized the impact that I can make by arming another person with the tools for their own success. In other words, I desire to empower people to lead even better versions of their lives. Healthcare certainly provides the means to do this, but there are many careers within the field that help people achieve their health and life goals. As I worked on my biology degree, I considered a veritable alphabet soup of career paths, from RN to PT to EMT, before landing firmly on the goal of becoming a physician. Yet again, I found that clarity in the woods. 

In January of 2021, I spent ten days tucked in a snowy North Carolina mountain “holler” with 20 other students training as Wilderness First Responders, or “woofers” as the abbreviation WFR is verbalized. Similar to a shortened EMT course, our curriculum included classroom learning about health issues that may come up in a backcountry setting, as well as outdoor sessions where students would take turns acting as patients with various ailments. I learned two important lessons from the patient simulations: I have no future in acting, but I really want to be a physician.

In one pivotal scenario, my pretend patient presented with respiratory distress and a recent history of unexplained pain in one leg. I worked through my assessment until I remembered seeing similar symptoms in a real patient while shadowing at a hospital. After the scenario, I confidently shared with the class that I had diagnosed the patient with a pulmonary embolism. Yes, the instructor told me, but that’s not the point. As a woofer, he explained, my job was not to deliver a diagnosis but gather enough information to determine whether that patient needed to “stay, go, or go fast.” Deflated, I was not satisfied with only those three options. I wanted to learn everything about the patient, gather all signs and symptoms, break it all down and build them back up into a diagnosis. Furthermore, I didn’t want to stop at the diagnosis but develop a proper treatment plan and help put it into action. After explaining all of this to my WFR instructor, he smiled and said, “You’re going to need more than a ten-day course for that, kid. Sounds like you need to head to medical school.” 

Now, sitting in my Wyoming EMT course a year later and across the country, I found myself having the same affirming feeling: it was time to take the big step forward in my medical journey. I appreciate all the skills I’ve learned from my wilderness medicine courses and have needed to use many of them while working as a trip leader or for a ski patrol. However, each experience left me wanting to know more and be able to do more for my patients. While I have learned so much in the lecture halls and research labs of UGA, the great outdoors presented me with my most important life lessons. On the lakes of Minnesota, I found myself called to a life of servant leadership and enabling my future patients to be the best, healthiest versions of themselves. In the mountains of North Carolina and plains of Wyoming, I confirmed the career path that would allow me to serve patients while satisfying my own need for intellectual challenge. I understand that the academic road ahead of me is arduous, but I face it with conviction, as no organic chemistry course or Minnesota wind storm has been able to stop me yet. I look forward to finally becoming that “grown-up” medical provider I’ve heard so much about and using those skills to assist others, whether in a hospital or out in the woods.","I shadowed a gynecologist in Georgia as he performed thirty pap smears in one day. For most American women, the practice is a quick routine with stirrups and paper gowns. In a different hemisphere, I assisted a gynecologist at a temporary clinic in a small Peruvian village. There the women wore traditional garb- long sleeves and skirts of thick, colorful fabric- that reflected their conservative social norms. Most were aghast when asked to assume the position for a pap smear. The doctor spent most of each visit explaining the importance of the test and taking measures to ensure as much modesty for the patient as possible, such as having me stand guard at the door. Instead of a quick routine, the Peruvian doctor spent much time addressing cultural concerns while still working in the patient‚Äôs best interest. With similar understanding and patience, I hope to learn about my patients‚Äô unique backgrounds so that I can tailor my educational and treatment plans to best benefit them.","One of the best choices I made in college was to join the international organization MEDLIFE, short for ‚ÄúMedicine, Education, and Development for Low-Income Families Everywhere.‚Äù I was attracted to the group‚Äôs holistic approach to service. With my school‚Äôs chapter, I participated in many local service projects and eventually took a position on the executive board to help plan and lead these events. For one event, we partnered with a local food bank during the fall of 2020. The food bank was having trouble safely distributing food at their facility, so we organized a drive-through food pick-up for families in need. I saw an opportunity to address another one of our organization‚Äôs pillars as well, so I distributed educational materials on COVID-19 and nutrition to every car at the event. The drive-through food distribution was a resounding success, and we proceeded to host two more similar events. I am proud that our chapter was able to safely address an urgent need in our community.",,,1,"The pandemic began in the spring semester of my junior year of college. I had begun volunteering weekly at Piedmont Athens Regional hospital in the fall semester and had to take a break from it for most of spring 2020. Additionally, I had plans to work as a backpacking instructor at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico that summer of 2020, but the program was canceled for that season. However, I was able to return as a canoe guide at Northern Tier in Minnesota where the program could be run socially distanced. Finally, I had plans for another medical service trip through the international organization MEDLIFE over the spring break of 2021, but unfortunately, that was not possible.

I was sitting in my middle school geography class, with my hand raised to answer a question about Sri Lanka's location on the map when I got a sinking feeling in my stomach. I rushed to the bathroom, leaving my answer up in the air where my hand used to be, hoping I'd make it before it left a mark. A fruitless attempt on yet another day where my period had bled through my menstrual products and ruined my pants.

Through middle school and high school, this became the norm for me and many other young students - getting excused from school due to a period mishap. We would be sent home to ""fix the problem,"" only to return to a bigger issue: an education interrupted by something that was out of our control, a part of our biology. I was tired of putting my education on hold because I had to go home and change on a monthly basis. The shame and embarrassment of these incidents stay fresh in my mind, and every now and then I still catch myself hiding a tampon in my jacket sleeve on the way to the bathroom, feeling like a vulnerable middle-schooler all over again.

Once I went to college, I was able to begin making decisions about my own health in a way I was not able to in the past. In the Latinx community, there is a social stigma behind young girls going to the gynecologist, let alone going on any form of birth control. This stigma pervaded into my own home so that there was nothing I could do to ease my heavy monthly cycles. People in the community conflate women's health with sexual promiscuity, and therefore many young women and girls miss the opportunity to get a head start on their health with preventative screens or the early HPV vaccine. I found myself dealing with unmanageable pain and heavy bleeding caused by my periods, but I was unable to ask for birth control to alleviate my symptoms due to these negative beliefs. This stigma behind women's health persists through every stage of life, and I have seen it manifest throughout my college experience and beyond. I have had close friends confide in me about health concerns related to UTIs, yeast infections, STIs, and pregnancy while still being hesitant to see a doctor. A lack of trust in physicians is widespread in many communities of color, and the intersection of women and other marginalized identities can compound this fear further.

This thought lingered in my head when I was shadowing Dr. Baker, a pediatrician, during one particularly poignant patient interaction. The patient was a young girl who came in with her mother and was showing potential symptoms of pregnancy. Her eyes were as wide as saucers while sitting in the examination room, and I could feel the tension between the patient and her mother. The patient explained her lack of knowledge surrounding her period, pregnancy, and sex. She was able to calm down once her mother left the room, and I witnessed how a positive physician-patient relationship led to her getting the information and care she needed. A pregnancy test and STI screen were ordered, and her confidentiality was protected. She made me think about myself as a teenager, and how I wished I had a physician with whom I felt comfortable disclosing personal information.

I know I am not alone in the struggle with the silent shame tied to reproductive health: the inability to make informed decisions due to negative social stigma is a reality faced by too many women. As an adult, I continue to recognize, and become more informed of, the systemic and societal barriers preventing women from receiving adequate care. When shadowing Dr. Chahroudi in the HIV outpatient clinic, there was a young mother who had just given birth to her first child. She told us how she was unaware of her HIV status, which could lead to negative health outcomes for her child, until her first prenatal appointment. The stigma behind HIV is another example of what could deter patients from getting tested or receiving preventative medications. I was fortunate to witness this child's prognosis, which due to thorough care from Dr. Chahroudi, seemed to lean towards a negative HIV diagnosis.

These two experiences, along with my personal experiences with women's health, unveiled to me how a kind, open, and well-trained physician can make a difference in women's lives from childhood to motherhood. The safety and understanding in both Dr. Baker's and Dr. Chahroudi's offices are qualities that I hope to emulate for my future patients.

I strive to become a better advocate for women's health. I hope to be a physician who can provide a sense of comfort to those coming into my office; someone whose patients feel they can speak with openly and free of judgement. While so much remains to be done on a societal level regarding women's healthcare, I know that as a physician I can ensure at least one more doctor's office is providing thoughtful, inclusive education and care to patients. As a part of the medical community, I will seek to expand my outreach to the physicians I work alongside, and I hope to one day take on an educational role to pass down my expertise to the next generation of physicians. I will be an adept and supportive provider, always endeavoring to do the best for my patients.","I volunteer at the Clarkston Community Health Center, which serves a large immigrant population. There, I met a Telegu-speaking family from India. The daughter explained her mother‚Äôs medical history by gesturing to her throat. She grew concerned when the translator did not understand, so I asked if it was a thyroid issue. The woman heard me say ‚Äúthyroid‚Äù and was overjoyed that I understood what she was communicating.  _x000D_
_x000D_
This experience made me reflect on when I was a caregiver for my grandmother. I recall how nervous I was when reciting past medical complications at her appointments. I felt, just as the woman in the clinic, how stressful it can be to put a loved one‚Äôs health into a stranger‚Äôs hands. Even though our backgrounds are different, I understood her. I learned that no matter where you come from, anxiety around healthcare is universal. Patients and caregivers are vulnerable, and being a calm, attentive physician goes a long way in making people feel comfortable. ","On the Executive Board of the Latinx Student Organization, I connected with my own Latinx community and opened my eyes to the many issues we faced within the university and beyond. Statistics show Hispanic populations have worse health outcomes compared to white, non-Hispanic people, which I witnessed firsthand when the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated health disparities. I heard stories from Latinx students ranging from limited healthcare access due to financial struggles to language barriers. I saw this call for help from my community and organized fundraising events to address the financial need of our wider Atlanta Latinx community._x000D_

I became more adept at serving underrepresented populations and became a voice of advocacy.

",,,1,"Before the onset of the pandemic, I was living on campus, with a paid lab position, and taking all my courses in person. Suddenly, I was given notice to vacate my university apartment immediately. My university's decision to transition fully to remote also meant that the remainder of my paid research lab position was terminated, along with potential clinical roles.

Blinded by the flashing lights of the ambulance and police cars around me, I paused to collect my thoughts. My ambulance crew was dispatched to the scene of a motor vehicle accident. As I approached the wreckage, I saw a middle-aged man lying motionless in his seat through the broken window. I reached through the window and felt his cold, damp hand and waning pulse. Next to his foot lay an empty syringe. I fought back turbulent emotions as I calmly told my crew chief about my patient's diminishing pulse and breathing. My patient's family watched me earnestly, trusting me to treat their loved one. I felt a sense of immense responsibility that I'd never felt before. His condition indicated overdose, and after administration of Narcan, his vitals improved. I was overwhelmed with gratitude that my patient survived, and I marveled at the power of medicine and the human body's complexities. 

The human body has always fascinated me. I spent every year of elementary school anticipating the next lesson on biology and watching youtube science videos with fervor after school. This curiosity only grew over time. I began my undergraduate studies almost sure that I'd pursue a Ph.D. in biology researching human disease models or genetics. I started my first-year research class with zeal; I was ready to apply everything I had learned in my science classes. I thoroughly enjoyed my courses and loved research, but as the semester progressed, I began to feel deprived of a certain fulfillment. I concluded that the stress and isolation of my first semester in college were getting to me, and I needed a break from the routine.

I actively pursued extracurriculars hoping for some sense of direction. I met and spoke with a diverse group of people between volunteering and working and discovered that their stories and lives interested me. It quickly became clear that the lack of fulfillment I was feeling in my science and research classes was due to a lack of human connection. This realization drove me to pursue experiences where the two worlds of science and human connection could intersect. I decided that I wanted to study biology in a clinical setting, so I could still make some human contact while also furthering my knowledge in the subject I loved. I enrolled in an EMT course that semester, excited for the opportunities this certification would grant me. It was during this course that my interest in medicine solidified. 

Soon after receiving my certification, I was a trainee on my first shift at my collegiate volunteer ambulance agency, and I had to take a blood glucose reading. I stared at the patient's shoes as I meekly explained that she would feel a quick poke from the lancet. I heard her chuckle and looked up to see an exhausted yet smiling face. She blithely exclaimed that I looked more scared than she was. I appreciated her kind humor as she gave me her hand without hesitation. She was hypoglycemic, but her energy returned a couple of juice boxes later. As I drove back, I realized that I loved every bit of that experience despite the anxiety. Above all, seeing her get better during the thirty minutes I spent with her felt inexplicably rewarding. I later wondered how she was doing, disappointed that I would likely never meet her again. Such experiences furthered my desire to become a doctor, where I can form long-term relationships with my patients while playing an active role in their healing. 

I decided to shadow a general surgeon working in a low-income community to learn more about the medical field. On my first day, I met a female patient scheduled for a cholecystectomy. She lay in the bed uncomfortably as the surgeon walked in to speak with her. She frustratedly asked questions about the procedure. I smiled as the doctor answered her questions patiently, asking her if he was making sense to her from time to time. As he turned to leave, he stopped to ask her if she was cold in the drafty room. She nodded, and he brought over a heated blanket, gingerly tucking her in and assuring her that he would do his best for her. She replied smiling, ""I know, doc, I trust you."" Her speech conveyed solace, in stark contrast to her original state. I was baffled at the doctor's ability to calm down a stressed patient simply by prompting a conversation and answering questions with grace and patience. I learned through this simple interaction the importance of the emotional well-being of the patient and building trust.

In retrospect, I realized how much I wanted to practice medicine when my overdose patient took his first breath of a new life. When his family thanked my crew through tears, I understood the importance of being emotionally present for the patient and their family. This call was one of my first as a cleared provider, and I will forever remember it. I often think about the patients and the families I have met and wonder how they are now. I have realized how much I value building relationships founded on trust. There is something magical about a doctor and their intimate connection to the patient's life for which they are responsible. This connection is one I aspire to establish in the future.","Although born and raised in a small town in upstate New York, I moved to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2012 for two years. Not knowing the Arabic language and being alienated from my American culture, I initially experienced culture shock in the metropolitan Arab city. But as time progressed, I began to embrace the immense diversity around me. At my international school, I befriended people like princes and princesses of royal families and refugees from war-torn countries. I learned the importance of having an open mind as I heard the stories of my friends from across the globe. I became accustomed to working with people of different backgrounds and built long-lasting relationships. I learned the importance of being a leader and inspiring leadership in others who struggled to find their place in a new culture. Reflecting on this experience through the healthcare lens, I realize how much I would enjoy a connection to a diverse patient population, further enhancing my cultural competence.","As a Wellness Advocate in my collegiate ambulance agency, I presented to agency members to educate them on various topics. One especially memorable presentation was that of the five social determinants of health. My peers and I emphasized the importance of keeping these determinants in mind when treating patients and being diligent in keeping personal biases at bay. Members approached me after the presentation, and we discussed in depth how these determinants influence our practice in the ambulance, especially when responding to specific patient demographics. _x000D_

As a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee member, I noticed discrepancies in our patient demographic. While speaking to various students of color on campus, I realized how some students distrust EMS and are unwilling to call for help even during dire situations. As a result, I advocated for my agency to reach out to cultural organizations on campus to educate students on our roles as EMS workers and their patient rights.",,,1,"Aside from the challenges I faced due to the acute transition to online learning and the cancellation of clinical opportunities, I was thankfully able to adapt my approach to gaining valuable experiences. As a Crisis Text Line Texter, I spoke to individuals who faced severely deleterious effects of the pandemic. As I responded to these individuals, I was greatly humbled. I saw firsthand how socioeconomic barriers prevented some of these individuals' access to healthcare and emotional support systems. While volunteering as an EMT in an underserved community, I became attuned to the lack of resources and education for community members at large. I gained a perspective on the work that healthcare workers must do in underserved areas to prevent the spread of misinformation. Although I faced adversity during the pandemic, it opened my eyes to many facets of our healthcare system that were not apparent to me before, and for that, I am grateful.",1,0,2
2023,15495095,,22,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"I was born in Venezuela and raised in a small village in south Lebanon by my mother and grandparents. While my father relocated to the United States to build his flooring business, my grandpa served as my role model and father figure. I consider myself a disadvantaged applicant because poverty created distinct challenges for me and my family, including my father’s separation to try and make ends meet; our constant moving (including back and forth to the USA); assimilating to America while being bullied for my accent and limited English skills; and dependence on federal assistance throughout high school and college – though I am blessed to benefit from federal aid.
 
In her efforts to support five children, my mother worked twice as hard to feed our family. Upon permanently relocating to the USA, I began working at my dad’s flooring shop to alleviate her burden. I also delivered food as a DoorDash driver and built a small e-commerce business for additional income. In college, I depended on Pell Grants and my two jobs to cover tuition, and relied on my more experienced predecessors – including peers, faculty, and advisors – to navigate my pre-medical path.

My legs numbed from the utter shock and heartbreak as his stretcher rolled away to carry off my dearest friend. I was left in existential paralysis as my mind raced between the fond memories of his precious life and the horrific scenes of its end. I lacked the language for it as a fifteen-year-old; but the word I needed to best understand the experience was trauma: his fatal motorcycle accident; my terror as I awoke my parents at sunrise with quivering lips to break the news; or the mourning of his loved ones. The trauma was all-encompassing, driving me into depression, and pulling me away from school. The numbness I felt was finally shattered when I was awoken by the blow of the letter “F” that covered my midterm coversheet – my first ever failure. I vividly remember questioning myself: Will I be okay with an “F”? Does “F” define me? Would he be okay with my “F”? From that point on, I transformed this “F” into the fuel I needed to begin healing from trauma and become a healing force for others. Before long, I realized it was no coincidence that this awakening led me right back to the trauma-filled environment of urgent care, where my passion for medicine – and goal to serve as a future physician – was cemented.  

As a child in the village of Aanqoun in southern Lebanon, delivering acute care in the form of treating patients with high grade burns was part of our family’s daily routine. Low socioeconomic status and health care resources kept patients away from the crippling and exorbitant hospital costs. Instead, they turned to a then-retired firefighter – my grandfather – who committed the remainder of his life to treat them free of charge. Patients showed up at our doorsteps indiscriminate of time or day, and I would reflexively run to fetch my grandfather’s heavy brown leather burn kit. As I grew older, that bag became lighter; and likewise, assisting my grandfather in treating burns became seamless. Less obvious at the time, witnessing his selfless act of kindness and impact on patients’ lives was a catalyst for a lifelong commitment to service. 

It was a commitment that I cherished dearly even after we immigrated to the United States of America. At first, with the site of neglected and malnourished children not as prevalent in my new American community, it was difficult to relate. Nevertheless, motivated by my previous experiences treating burn-patients, and empowered by Gandhi’s saying: “the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others,” I enrolled in the Henry Ford Wyandotte Hospital (HFWH) Health Occupations courses. There, I was exposed to crucial elements of health care such as bedside manners, patient advocacy, collaborative care, and patient-centered medicine. Assisting patients and interacting with physicians, nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists, and physiotherapists offered foundational insight into the American health care system and grounded my interest in medicine. I also had a humbling glimpse at the unique challenges faced by patients at HFWH including cultural barriers to medicine, uninsured medical expenses, and mental health; all of which put my privilege in prespective.  

With hopes of broadening my exposure, I joined the Atlantis premed shadowing program in Spain. I was fortunate to scrub in over twenty procedures and shadow numerous specialties such as pediatrics, cardiology, urology, general surgery, trauma, and orthopedics. I closely followed one patient with a severe penetration injury through the abdomen and thorax. Witnessing the continuity of care from his emergency presentation; urgent extraction of foreign body and irrigation and debridement; admission to intensive care; and treatment of multiorgan failure in the context of post-operative sepsis, was both exhilarating and heartwarming. To be there for patients in the thin line between breath and air, is a feeling I can best express not with words, but rather my unwavering determination to fulfill a career in medicine. 

Further, I was fortunate to volunteer at the Life Medical Center urgent care in Dearborn, MI – where I became a medical assistant (MA). Under the mentorship of Dr. Eldirani, I was introduced to evidence-based medicine and its impact on patient outcomes. It was exciting to learn how wet lab and clinical research studies are translated to the bedside. With time, I began exploring how my research under the supervision of Dr. Belanger at Detroit Mercy could be applicable to health care. We investigated the effects of Atrazine, a nationally used herbicide, on development and behavior of crayfish. I relished in discovering that crayfish are used as model organisms to study olfaction in higher vertebrae. I aim to continue expanding my research skillset to improve patient care and empower my future patients.

Ultimately, I approached each of these experiences with a dedicated and inquisitive mind to explore and unite the values of healing, advocacy, and empowerment. As an MD candidate, these are the values I will champion and carry forth; for I have learned that regardless of my path as a physician, I can always find myself, by being lost in service to others.","Working as a medical assistant, and helping my grandfather treat burn patients were two of my most pivital moments in my premed journey. With each experience, I united healing and advocacy with a dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)‚Äì values I will champion at Rush Medical College. Through it all, I was endowed with a critical lesson: never underestimate a seemingly small act. I learned how a kind act could develop a cherished bond with a patient all while ameliorating their healing journey. For example, if one speaks a foreign language, they may require a translator. However, making small efforts such as using Google translate is better than silence, and fosters a sense of inclusion. _x000D_

Finally, as a Lebanese migrant, I have developed a global view committed to building bridges of understanding. I can‚Äôt forget being bullied for my thick accent; and yet, I am grateful for the empathy, cross-cultural understanding, and commitment to DEI that my own experiences afford me.","Lebanon faced the worst humanitarian and economic crisis in its history. Realizing their needs, I reached out to my friends and initiated a fundraiser to raise money by placing donation boxes at local supermarkets and gas stations. As the organization began to grow, we reached out to other people, organizations, influencers, and businesses, and we have now raised over $10,000 for Lebanon. Since everyone is a unique individual able to bring something new to the table, I realized the value of teamwork and learning from others. Having the experience of working with different personalities and communicating skillfully in a crisis context has broadened my perspective on leadership styles, humanism, and social justice. My involvement with the Lebanon Relief project and other non-profit organizations have led me to the MD program at Rush Medical College, which fosters similar outreach programs in underserved areas.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic was filled with challenges ‚Äì the most devastating being losing my beloved grandfather.

During the pandemic, I felt burdened by the new virtual learning environment and the lack of support. It affected me not only academically but also mentally. To resolve my frustration, I learned to ask for help more often than I was accustomed to and comfortable with ‚Äì which was both humbling and important for my self-growth. I also learned how to meditate and find my inner peace to create a more sustainable lifestyle and mental environment as we transitioned into a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù of remote learning. _x000D_

This transition was challenged by familial and work responsibilities that I did not have the privilege of dismissing, solely because I was a freshman in college. Both my parents have worked labor intensive jobs that at full-time barely allow for some financial relief. I took on a job at sixteen to aid financially and improve internet access at home, increase access to nutritious foods, and have the means of supporting my transportation. My upbringing has led me to constantly adapt and take on a non-traditional leadership role in my family to provide stability. While in college although my familial responsibilities decreased, I still contribute financially and provided support. In combination with work, commuting to school, and extracurriculars, it’s been critical to have proper time management to carry out my day to day.

As I considered careers, I wanted a role that would grant me the opportunity to lead outreach and advocacy efforts, serve as an educator, and have the possibility of working with marginalized communities. It was not until an unforeseen event impacted my family, that I was exposed to the possibility of becoming a physician and be able to carry out those functions in society. In December of 2017, my mom was in a terrible collision, and she had to be rushed to the hospital. As I tried to process my own worry and fear, I was hindered by thoughts of figuring out healthcare coverage and providing support to my family. From a young age I began taking an active role in my family to alleviate stress, which for me meant managing payments, translations, and advocating for my parents. My voice was especially impactful in predominantly English-speaking spaces, like health care settings where I served as the medium between my parents and their providers. I didn’t know if my mom would be receiving adequate care due to linguistic and cultural barriers, further adding to my concern for her. Fortunately, we had an engaged healthcare team that prioritized my mom’s symptoms, making sure no information was lost during the translation process. Members of the healthcare team relayed educational information to my family on how to best support my mom during her recovery. It was the first time a physician had demonstrated investment in my family’s health. Witnessing the interaction the provider had with my family and their role within the healthcare team, prompted my motivations to pursue a career in medicine. I realized the physician’s role encompassed the efforts in which I was interested in engaging. 

As I entered college I chose to major in biology and nutritional sciences. This allowed me to obtain a solid foundation in science while also obtaining public health application of the molecular basis of disease. Considering that as a physician I will have to consider disease of a patient with social determinants of health that may hinder recovery or management of disease, the exposure to public health and biology further catalyzed my pursuit of medicine. While being a research assistant, under the guidance of Dr. Susana Matias, I have seen the application of these principles amongst Latinx farmworkers by assessing factors during the COVID-19 pandemic that have exacerbated workplace risks, housing, and healthcare access for this population. Helping in the data cleaning and analysis process, I used Spanish, to understand responses and assign responses to specific categories. The prevalence of chronic disease and occupational risks is high in this population, yet little research or advocacy is done on this vulnerable community. I decided to participate in this research to continue to bring awareness and support to this community, to help build relationships amongst this group and help ensure advocacy efforts continue in creating equitable access to health care. I realized research plays an integral role in advancements within medicine and helps bring awareness to issues that may otherwise remain neglected. As a physician I hope to continue the expansion of research amongst marginalized populations.

As I continued my exploration of medicine, I became a medical assistant in an internal medicine and gastrointestinal clinic. I made it my personal mission to vegetate supportive and inclusive environments that allowed patients to disclose their concerns. By reading up on previous encounters, engaging in conversation, and relieving pressure from the clinic visit - which most times is surrounded with fear and worry - patients are able to confide in me and relay their specific needs. As I witness how our providers interact with their South Asian community, it is visible that removing cultural and linguistic barriers leads to better health outcomes, patient retention, and providing accessibility in understanding medicine. Patients were more willing to join efforts with the provider since they had information explained to them in a language and ways they understand. As a physician I hope to continue to dismantle barriers for Spanish speaking and other marginalized communities. 

I hope to emulate the physicians on our team to similarly educate, mentor and lead with compassion, cultural competency, and patience. These efforts will be integral in my practice as I hope to foster an environment that is supportive for patients and the healthcare team. My initial motivation to explore medicine came from a life changing event my mom experienced and my experience in clinical settings has further cemented this career path. I believe that as a physician, I am able to continue engaging in aspects of biology and public health, such as diagnosing, educating, and continuing research and advocacy, which will allow me to work directly with patients from various backgrounds in alleviating distress and healthcare barriers.","As a medical assistant, stationed at a primary care clinic and an urgent care, I witness the contrast between patients that have access to a PCP versus those who do not and resort to urgent cares to manage their conditions. Like many low-income patients, I am ensured through Medi-Cal. I have access to a PCP and can advocate for my parents‚Äô health during their visits. Unfortunately, documentation status is factored into eligibility of Medi-Cal. Uninsured populations at the urgent care struggles to navigate predominantly English-speaking spaces and face barriers in finding affordable healthcare insurance. These barriers lead them to urgent cares when conditions are exacerbated but require long term attention to ensure there are improvements. Without further outreach, neglecting linguistic challenges and barriers to obtaining insurance discourages non-English speaking patients from seeking care ultimately exacerbating disease burden amongst underrepresented populations.","As a Health Advocate for Alameda Health System, I helped serve low-income, marginalized communities. In my role I listened, lead with compassion, and advocated for patient needs. I facilitated the connection between patients and community organizations that addressed legal aid, food insecurity and financial resources. The work I was conducting was like my role at home, since I helped many Spanish speaking patients navigate predominately English-speaking spaces. Additionally, as a Digital Health Navigator, I surveyed patients on telehealth options. Through the telehealth survey, I assessed any barriers patients faced in taking advantage of telehealth services like digital literacy, devices, and internet access to subsequently connect them with community resources that can aid their circumstance and screen them for free devices funded by Roots Community Health Center. _x000D_

Juggling work, academic and extracurricular activities became challenging when the transition to in-person learning began because I had to factor in a 40-minute commute to my schedule since I lived at home with my parents.

I was assigned to care for this man and document his injuries. As I began the triage, he barely looked me in the eye and mumbled, “I’m alright.” I quickly saw that while this man may not have had any glaring injuries that I could physically attend to, he was hurting and required care. My heart immediately went out to him, and I stopped asking my checklist of questions and put a hand on his shoulder. I reassuringly stated “Hey, you're not alone, I am here for you. You let me know whatever you need, ok?” as I stayed by his side, conversing, until the scene was cleared. While he did not require bandages or an arm splint, he needed someone to stand with him and help navigate through the shock of the accident. I left the scene that day knowing I had helped this man accomplish a meaningful victory over the initial grief and fear that loom when processing a tragic moment such as this. This experience among many others as a volunteer firefighter have helped shape my understanding of what true care is. While it requires using fact-based knowledge to solve the visible issues, it also necessitates employing empathetic and tactful service to bring the oft hidden realities of the situation to the surface.
 Interning in the UC Davis Medical Center Surgical ICU provided a close connection to healthcare and inspired my passion to be a medical doctor. In the unit there was an elderly man, “Bill”, too frail to eat on his own and each shift I made a point to feed him his breakfast tray. While I quartered his grapes and mixed granola into his oatmeal, Bill and I chatted about life and formed a genuine connection which often centered around our shared love for basketball. Our interactions taught me patience while allowing me to hear his beautiful story and understand Bill as a person, not just the patient in bed 14. Feeding patients was not one of my designated tasks, but was something the nurses greatly appreciated me assisting in.  As I reflected on why I went out of my way to do this, I was reminded of my goal to be a person of service. I joined this internship to contribute to the healthcare team in any way possible and feeding patients was a contribution. Our conversations about Bill’s college years and my questions about his grandkids put him at ease and allowed him to forget about his pain for a time. My small contribution to Bill’s wellness allowed him to feel welcome in a place that was far from home. The impact I had on Bill helped inspire me to pursue a career as a medical doctor where I will have an even greater capacity to connect with patients on an emotional level while taking a lead in making medical decisions for their physical betterment. No matter if I am the doctor determining a care plan or just the intern serving eggs, each patient deserves the utmost attention to detail and steadfast care. 
As a silent observer of thousands of patient-provider interactions, scribing in the emergency department (ED) has provided me with an excellent view of the diversity, depth of knowledge and responsibility involved in medicine. Hundreds of people come through the ED in a day, and many seem to have similar complaints or come from the same background, but I have learned that each patient is unique. Allowing the toxic culture of preconceived notions to creep in quickly crowds out the ability to provide empathetic service. Providing this level of service requires compassion which motivates the most detailed analysis. As a scribe, doctors often call out exam findings or critical labs, and I must document them in a meaningful way. Instead of simply waiting for the provider, I developed a habit of reviewing results, so I could anticipate what the physician wanted me to record. This practice has developed my interest in each diagnosis because every case presents an opportunity to learn and expand my inquiry in medicine, while also exposing me to the responsibility involved as a leader in patient care. In the face of this commitment, each physicians’ unwavering resolve to care for patients individually has inspired me to develop an even greater attention to detail and a vision for equitable care as I seek to be a medical doctor. 
My interactions during roadside emergencies, while bedside in the ICU and at the emergency department have been vital along my journey to medical school. I have learned to patiently connect with people in my care, execute my role on the team with excellence and provide each patient with empathetic service. As a doctor, I do not want to approach patient care with just a “see problem, fix problem” mindset, instead I will resolve to know I am treating real people who may be going through something I could never comprehend. I aspire to approach each case with humility and a mind ready to listen, not any presumptions of who the person is, where they come from or what they may have been through. I want to commit my life to being a leader in the service of others. Practicing medicine as a physician provides a perfect opportunity to discover the unique realities of those around me and use those insights to provide them with the most compassionate care possible.","With three other students, I led a public health campaign to aid ""Help Me Grow Yolo County'' (HMGYC) with their community outreach through event planning and social media advertisements. HMGYC is an organization that provides free developmental screening and community resources to children of underserved populations. When interviewing families of diverse backgrounds, who had used HMGYC‚Äôs resources, I gained a greater understanding of the financial hardships and difficulty accessing healthcare they face. Collaborating with the project manager and families, we developed a survey for parents in English and Spanish, allowing the community members to provide feedback to HMGYC. This experience opened my eyes to the difficulty underserved populations have obtaining needed healthcare support and the many ways I can help. Working with HMGYC inspired me to advance health equity by supporting organizations that provide essential resources to underserved communities.","I have impacted my rural hometown community through my work as a volunteer firefighter for the West Plainfield Fire Department. Every day, I carried a radio with me which alerted me when our department was dispatched on a call.

Fade to black. I’d wake again, this time to my mother crying over me hysterically. This odd morning routine became my new norm when I was diagnosed with a pediatric epileptic condition. I frequented the hospital and received nothing short of excellent care. Unusually enough, I became enthusiastic about these visits and admired the providers for their unwavering kindness and patience. I developed aspirations to help children who face similar challenges and to replicate this standard of care.
After outgrowing my seizures, life was uneventful until high school. Within a month, I was devastated by the abrupt passing of my grandmother on my birthday, my father suffering a heart attack requiring surgery and my grandfather’s diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. This was then followed by my mother’s and eventually my cousin’s battles with cancer. I learned to view the hospital with a more solemn understanding and deeper empathize with those facing illness. I do not desire to dwell on hardships, but to exemplify a medical reality where not every patient can be saved and many individuals are indirectly affected as a result. This underscored the importance of treating the whole patient, which means taking their loved ones into account as well. These experiences demonstrated that physicians must carry themselves with relentless optimism, kindness and resilience. 
I developed an interest in science with a strong preference for biology, which later became my major during my undergraduate studies. My collegiate interest in biology matured to a passion for biomedicine after my cousin fell ill. I coped by clasping on to a future in which I could delay death and found myself seeking knowledge about these conditions. Inspired by my family’s challenges, I narrowed in on attending medical school.
After graduation, I became a certified medical assistant at a Dermatology practice. I developed a close relationship with four physicians and intently studied their interactions with patients. The doctors that I worked with were unique, but all demonstrated defining traits that I came to recognize in myself. They exuded extraordinary compassion and attention to detail while providing indiscriminate care. Each physician, and most impressively the pediatric dermatologist, always remained patient and calm. Perhaps what I admired most was the genuine relationships that they developed with their patients. I truly appreciated this aspect of medicine and aimed to develop similar relationships with patients.
I treated each patient as an opportunity to learn and tried my best to incorporate these impressive qualities into my interactions. This experience provided unforeseen growth in my ability to perform medical tasks, interact with patients and thrive as a member of a team. I eventually was promoted to lead medical assistant and became responsible for more complex tasks and training other M.A.’s. My employers applauded my progress in this role and expressed their confidence in my potential as a medical student. I continued this experience with an eagerness to learn and improve myself as a medical professional.
My life shifted when my roommate moved out to care for his father who developed COVID-induced Guillain-Barre syndrome. This led me back to San Diego, where I navigated the MCAT while shadowing, volunteering and assisting in care for my disabled mother, niece and autistic nephew. My nephew, who requires constant supervision, is also non-verbal which helped me improve my ability to communicate beyond speech. My experiences with him sparked a newfound compassion and interest in providing care for complex patients, including those with special needs. This period helped me learn to efficiently manage several obligations, as well as, reaffirmed the value of family and the patience that you must carry as a physician.
I went on to expand my experiences by working as a M.A. at an Orthopedic Surgeon’s office and engaging in clinical research. In contrast to dermatology, orthopedic patients often arrived in agony. I was moved by each providers’ empathy and relentless efforts to help those in severe pain. Despite a patient’s tears and frustrations, the providers always remained collected, supportive and treated symptoms as pieces of a puzzle. They used physical manipulations, advanced imaging and data from procedures such as nerve conduction studies to identify the sources of their pain. I was fascinated by their abilities, and after watching several successful procedures in the operating room – inspired. 
My experiences have provided a unique lens into what it means to work in healthcare and continue to drive my pursuit of attending medical school. Each challenge has reinforced my compassion, enthusiasm to learn and my desire to help others. By choosing to become a physician, I intend to treat complex patients and build lasting relationships while upholding a high-standard of care. I’m aware that the health-related hardships I've faced are universal, and I can only imagine a future in which I’m a part of the solution – I seek a greater purpose in which I can contribute to someone living a healthy, fulfilled life.","In urban San Diego, Scripps Hospital treats a diverse population of disadvantaged and underserved individuals.

Although my upbringing differs from the background of many patients, I have connected with them by understanding their unique circumstances.

All my life I witnessed this but didn’t realize the severity until I volunteered during high school at the Poverelo House, a non-profit that provides meals and services to the homeless community. One day after serving meals, I joined a table and listened to their conversations. I was amazed to hear how much of a commodity food was to them. The next few days at school, I noticed students throwing wrapped, uneaten hamburgers and burritos into the garbage and couldn’t believe my eyes: yesterday I’d heard that food was nearly gold to one group of people while a few miles down the street students were throwing it away. I knew I had to do something. After racking my brain for weeks, I finally came up with the Food Recovery Program to collect, repurpose, and distribute the wrapped and untouched “waste” from student lunches and deliver it to the needy people in our community. For the next several months, I talked out the details with the school district’s staff and officials, the director of the local food bank, and my team of volunteers. Seeing my program give hope to thousands of people in my hometown inspired me to devote my life to serving my community and improving poverty—I just had to figure out the best way to do it. 

During a 2018 visit to Masten Towers, one of the low-income housing facilities where we delivered food for the Food Recovery Program, I saw firsthand how food insecurity can affect health outcomes. Masten Towers was in the middle of a “food desert,” which meant residents had to resort to fast food or other unhealthy choices that contributed to ailments such as diabetes. During my visit, I met Jose, who appeared malnourished and confided to me that he had a difficult time affording healthy food, housing, and medical care. When I visited two years later, I reencountered Jose and he told me he was glad that there were people like me who cared. Throughout his life, he’d felt abandoned, but now things seemed different. He said he was both happier and healthier due to the nutritious food choices. Seeing my advocacy create better health outcomes showed me I could best serve my community by becoming a physician who directly works with patients to educate them on healthier living. 

To learn more, I started shadowing doctors both at UCLA and in Fresno. The contrast between these two made me realize the differences in resources, training, and technology between a major metropolitan area hospital and community hospitals like those in my hometown. I experienced this disparity firsthand when a family friend, Maria, was told by a local doctor in 2021 that her prognosis for her condition was poor. When she told me the terrible news, I comforted and reassured her. Then, I researched treatment options with Maria and ultimately helped her find the care in San Francisco. Others, however, aren’t as fortunate. When my father’s friend, Harold, was diagnosed with prostate cancer, he elected to have a “routine” prostatectomy at Fresno Community Hospital, but died due to complications during the surgery. Harold had wanted to go Los Angeles for his procedure, but couldn’t make the trip due to financial restraints. These experiences showed how factors like finances, accessibility, and doctor experience and training can affect the care patients receive and their overall health outcomes. Moreover, helping Maria find the care she needed made me more confident in my decision to pursue medicine and make better medical care more equitable and accessible to these underserved.

Seeing these two opposite health outcomes also motivated me to become an undergraduate researcher under Dr. Leonard Marks at UCLA to study new treatment modalities and give doctors everywhere more knowledge and confidence. My current research aims to make prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment more humane. With focal therapy, a non-invasive technique for ablating tumors in the prostate, I saw an operation performed in the clinic and within two hours the patient was walking out of the room cancer-free. I was astonished that someone could go from having cancer to being cancer-free in one morning, whereas radiation can take many months and have debilitating side effects. Seeing the direct effect we are having on people’s lives has inspired me to use medicine and research to provide high-quality care to underserved communities and beyond.  

My journey toward healthcare began after noticing the wastefulness and food insecurity in my hometown. Though I am immensely proud of my Food Recovery Program, it also exposed me to the healthcare disparities that poverty, food insecurity, and poor access to quality healthcare can cause. My subsequent research experience as well as my interactions with Maria and Harold have inspired me to become a physician to address these issues. Working to find creative solutions through research and learning how to deliver quality medical care is my driving force. I am now physically and mentally ready and prepared to devote myself to improving my community through medicine.","I grew up in Fresno, home to a large diverse and underserved population. As a teenager, I saw the disparities in healthcare that many faced and created a program that collects the uneaten food from local primary and secondary schools and delivers it to the needy population. As the program‚Äôs founder/leader, I collaborated with many people of different backgrounds, listened to them, and made a plan to meet the needs of the people. These experiences helped me in March when I volunteered with my Swipe Out Hunger club at a homeless shelter in LA. I used the skills I learned in my previous experiences to form relationships with the diverse population we were serving, many of whom were immigrants. _x000D_

I believe that I‚Äôm well-prepared to communicate and interact with diverse peers and patients at Rush Medical College. I hope to practice inclusive excellent during medical school and beyond by developing free clinics in underserved regions in Chicago to provide reliable and no-cost medical care. ","As a third generation Armenian-American, I‚Äôve been active in the Armenian Church, youth group, and at the California Armenian Home (a skilled nursing facility). Growing up, I often heard and learned about the poverty in Armenia, but never had the opportunity to see it in person. Finally, in 2018, after spending two summers of fundraising at the Saturday Farmers Market at my high school, I made enough to go to Darbnik, an impoverished village, to hand out clothes and school supplies. There, I noticed the aged and beaten clothing the children had; some were even shoeless! We proceeded to hand out a wide selection of shirts, shorts, socks, shoes, and educational books and items. I‚Äôll always remember how the children‚Äôs eyes lit up when they finally received their new clothes and school materials. Being able to personally change the lives of all the children in this village strengthened my resolve to become a physician for the underserved.",,,1,"The pandemic made it difficult for me to get research positions or internships since everything was closed. Like everybody else‚Äôs, my campus was immediately shut down and didn‚Äôt fully open for 18 months. Prior to March 2020, I had internships and positions lined up, but I wasn‚Äôt able to pursue them during the pandemic. One of the positions that I was looking forward to the most was my Sports Medicine internship with UCLA athletics. I would have been working with the athletes, tending to their needs alongside doctors and trainers. Above all, I would have learned a lot about sports medicine and how to handle athletic injuries and rehab. _x000D_

Therefore, as I sat in my middle school health class watching a vague video about puberty from 1999, getting my period became my biggest fear. It wasn't the start of my period that haunted me, but rather the inevitable, and seemingly forbidden, conversation I would have to have with my mom. Due to cultural expectations and language barriers, my family never talked about menstruation, and sometimes I wondered if my older sister and mom even had periods. When the inevitable did occur, I mustered up all of my courage to tell my mom about the new development. Unsurprisingly, instead of educating me on what was happening in my body, my mom bombarded me with rules and restrictions I had to follow. Instead of teaching me proper hygiene techniques, I was taught to hide my pads and tampons in brown paper bags. I wasn’t allowed to wear certain clothes, I couldn’t go to religious places, and I could only use a certain bathroom in the house because I was “dirty.” Throughout the conversation, my mom didn’t use the words period or menstruation once. Instead, she used phrases such as “that time of the month” and “when you don’t feel well”.
Menstruation felt like a curse. I felt disconnected from my body due to the mysteries of why I was bleeding, what was causing the bleeding, and how my body was changing in other ways. The taboo around menstruation and other health issues in my family fueled my desire to seek out information about the human body and medicine. 
Studying human physiology at my university answered my many questions about the human body and its mechanisms in times of success and failure. Inevitably, my growing knowledge about medicine was paired with an increasing awareness of the lack of communication about and access to health information. It was a pattern that was frustratingly evident in every patient encounter I had. As an EMT, I noticed the patients’ confusion about blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes. As a clinical research assistant at the VA, every conversation about Parkinson’s disease with the patients was filled with shoulder shrugs and uncertainty. The gaps in their knowledge about the medical devices and their diseases often led to their noncompliance with health care interventions. So when taking blood pressures, I would explain to patients how I was inflating the cuff to stop the flow of blood, similar to stopping water flowing in a pipe, and then I was listening for the flow to begin again. When showing Parkinson's patients specific exercises to improve their symptoms, I explained the role of exercise in improving their balance and strength to prevent falls.
After satisfying my urge to understand the human body, these new experiences inspired me to minimize misconceptions and increase health literacy through education. Determined to combine my fascination with the human body and my passion for communicating with individuals about their care, I decided to pursue a Master's in Public Health during my gap year. My goal was to gain skills for effective communication and promotion through cultural competency and analytical thinking.
My decision to pursue an MPH degree, and eventually an MD degree, was reinforced through scribing for Dr. C at the Brigham and Women’s Dermatology department. Dr. C, who has both an MPH and MD degree, showed me the ability to both treat the ailment and prevent future disease through education with each patient encounter. 
On my third day as a scribe, we were running behind the schedule as I followed Dr. C into the last appointment of the day. From the moment we walked into the room, I felt the patients’ apprehension and unease engulf the room like a storm cloud. Dr. C radiated compassion and empathy as she absorbed the patient's endless list of concerns. Instead of dismissing each lesion as benign, she used colloquial language to patiently talk about each mole and explain how seborrheic keratoses arise. She described each treatment, detailed the mechanism of the prescribed medications, and helped the patient practice identifying lesions on her own skin using a handheld mirror. The patient's anxiety was replaced by trust and confidence in both Dr. C and her own ability to care for her skin. As I stood in the corner of the stark white exam room scrambling to document the details of the appointment, I couldn't help but be enchanted by Dr. C’s magical ability to empower and educate her patients and dream about being in Dr. C’s position in the future. Being a physician had been my dream due to its intricate relationship with understanding and rectifying the functions of the human body. Now the same dream is fueled by my desire to empower individuals by providing necessary knowledge about their bodies and the relevant medicine, enabling them to participate in their own care. 
The once 11-year-old girl who feared menstruation and was hindered by the uncertainty of her body would be proud that she decided to complete her MPH degree and pursue an MD degree. Through these two degrees, I will educate others through compassion and empathy about their bodies to empower autonomy and confidence in their abilities to make beneficial health decisions.","Because I was raised to prioritize education above all else, I was surprised to see the 5th-grade girls I mentored think school was ‚Äú a waste of time‚Äù. My initial reaction was to label them as ‚Äúlazy and ungrateful‚Äù. However, as I took a step back and attempted to understand my mentees‚Äô backgrounds, I recognized that their families didn't view dedication as a necessity._x000D_
In this situation, instead of judging the girls, I patiently discuss their perspectives on education and its benefits with them. They explained why they felt studying was useless and I respectfully responded with why I thought knowledge was valuable because it can help solve intricate problems and help them enter their dream careers._x000D_
Through this experience, I learned that along with one‚Äôs culture and ethnicity, their upbringing has a major impact on their beliefs and values. As a future physician, I will evaluate all patient interactions from multiple perspectives to provide tailored care to each patient. ","As an EMT in Boston, I encountered patients from a wide range of socioeconomic classes. With each patient interaction, I noticed a blaring difference in their knowledge of the health system and their medical treatments._x000D_
One trip with a 40-year woman showed me the power of knowledge in medical care. When the ride began, the patient avoided eye contact and shied away when I tried to take her blood pressure and HR. Instead of telling her ‚Äúit's protocol‚Äù, I explained how blood flows through our vessels like water in pipes and used a similar analogy to explain the importance of pressure. I felt her anxiety melt away as she told me that this is the first time in 15 years that she understood the purpose of all the ‚Äúpoking and prodding‚Äù._x000D_
Through this experience, I recognized that lack of healthcare education is a major contributor to health disparities. At Rush, I hope to use my public health knowledge to create accessible health information resources for the surrounding Chicago communities.",,,1,"After receiving the dreaded ‚Äúcampus is closing‚Äù email, it felt as if time froze still. I had left friends without goodbyes, my belongings were left in my dorm, and my clinical activities were paused. Although I was grateful to have a stable home to quarantine in, I noticed my overall motivation falter. I slowly disconnected from society because I found it difficult to engage in conversations and social media due to the constant devastating news of overflowing ERs, children losing parents, and citizens disobeying precautions. _x000D_
Aware that ignoring the tragedies wasn‚Äôt the solution, I become a safe care assistant at BWH to aid in the pandemic-relief efforts in any way I could. There, I handed out clean masks to all visitors and checked symptom attestation badges to help keep healthcare workers safe. _x000D_

2023,15508034,,25,Woman,USA,1,EO2,0,1,"I grew up in an underserved healthcare area in Nigeria. The closest hospital was quite far and I only visited for emergencies as we were expected to give part payment before treatment though they did not have enough providers. This led to self-medication. Whenever I was sick, my mother usually diagnosed malaria or typhoid - it was always either of the two. She was not a healthcare professional but It was the best she could do as there were no alternatives. She usually gets medication from medicine stores or from the market. I recall an adverse reaction of rashes and skin peeling I once had after self-medicating on an adulterated drug for malaria. Additionally, there was no running water and constant electricity, I used candles and kerosene lamps for homework and chores which contributed to my poor eyesight.

When people had a medical emergency, there were no ambulances to take them to the hospital. One such incident occurred when I was 11 years old. Our neighbor, Mama Chinaza, went into labor at 11 PM. Unfortunately, it was one of those nights when we had a power failure in the neighborhood. The closest hospital was 90 minutes away and my Uncle Alex was the only one who had a car in the apartment complex. En route to the hospital, I did everything to pacify Mama Chinaza. I offered her water and practiced everything I had seen in the movies with her.  Luckily, she successfully gave birth to a girl.  Soon, Uncle Alex’s car became the “ambulance” in our apartment, and I was his assistant. We had to frequently take our diabetic neighbor to the hospital because he lacked insulin and had an inappropriately high carbohydrate diet. Ultimately, it was my experiences with Uncle Alex that made me develop a passion for patient care.

To learn more about medicine, the closest thing I had was a copy of a brown-paged, dusty, old “Where There Is No Doctor,” an encyclopedia of ailments and their treatments. I went through this book like a dictionary and as I flipped through each page with more hunger for knowledge, my mind could not comprehend why I needed to tie a cloth to stop a bleed or give salt water to a diarrheic person.  I marveled at each descriptive scenario while also being hopeful that I would know what to do for the sick or injured when there was no help around. As a young child in Nigeria, I wanted to be a doctor and be part of a team that does their best in ensuring health access for everyone.

I moved to the U.S. 6 years ago for better opportunities, and with my immigration, I had better access to healthcare. To learn more about medicine in this new country, I became a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and worked with a care team to develop care plans for patients. I looked at my patients holistically, rather than thinking of them as sick or injured. One memorable patient I had was a middle-aged woman, who was admitted for kidney failure. Overwhelmed with emotions of all the things going on in her life, she burst into tears. I empathized with her and for the rest of her stay in the hospital, I visited and chatted with her while making sure that she was comfortable. This experience furthered my desire to continue to educate myself so that I could help people like her directly.

As a CNA, I take value in the little experiences I have with patients in being able to express empathy; things like helping an elderly lady speak with her family members or making sure a patient with dementia listen to their favorite music every day. Every patient has their own burden to bear, and because of this, I made it a priority to create an atmosphere where they can focus on their comfort and health. While I love the personal interactions I get with my patients as a CNA, I wish to have a more active role by becoming a physician to help lead patients to make changes in their lifestyles. My experience working with patients has taught me about the quality of patience and compassion because some may not get better, but the kindness shown is rarely forgotten.

I understood the value of patience in helping others when I started tutoring students. I not only wanted to fulfill my mission in life through medicine but through education as well. As a student, I learned that a lot of people cannot advocate for themselves because of limited knowledge. With this in mind, I became a literacy tutor to help illiterate adults in English and Math hone their skills in hopes of increasing their health literacy. As I gained more insight into my students, I noticed I helped them gain more confidence in learning as they achieved academic success. In turn, I felt elated in helping them reach their goals. This experience inspired me to become a physician who empowers her patients through health literacy, education, and patient care, especially in underserved communities.

My goal is to cater to underserved communities as I have an understanding of what it is like living and growing up in one. Fortunately, my diabetic neighbor is doing okay now and the last time I visited Nigeria, I bought him a glucometer and taught him how to use it to help him better manage his diabetes. While I could not help with his food insecurity problems, I gave him tips on foods to eat and avoid. As a student and as a nursing assistant, I have learned to recognize that there are other factors that affect one’s health.

The brown, old book is still collecting more dust somewhere in our apartment in Nigeria and has served its purpose in my life by fueling my desire in medicine. Thanks to my science classes, I now understand the purpose of a tourniquet and an electrolyte solution! I may never understand everything in that book, but I do know that my experiences have instilled in me a desire to help and educate others, values that will prepare me for a career in medicine.  Whether it is working as a volunteer doctor in my home country, or working as a physician in the U.S., I aim to treat, while also empowering patients to play active roles in preserving their health","It was at the memory care unit of an assisted living community that I was exposed to the different cognitive health problems facing the senior residents. For ‚ÄúSunny‚Äù, I had to remind him to pull his pants down before he urinated, and for ‚ÄúMary'', I had to remind her that her room was the first door on the left. I learned how to uniquely care for people with different physical and mental capabilities and patiently instruct them to complete a small task. My job has developed my bedside manner, and I saw the value of small interactions in a patient‚Äôs experience: light and temperature changes can make their room a little more similar to home. These small factors are important when addressing a patient‚Äôs care beyond their presenting symptoms and in improving a patient‚Äôs overall outcomes. As a physician, I will have these experiences in mind to provide quality patient care and address social factors that affect health, especially in service to underserved and vulnerable populations.","I decided to be a volunteer tutor at Charles County‚Äôs literacy program because of research that I did which highlighted the impact of literacy on healthcare outcomes. I meet with my student biweekly and teach basic math skills while also developing a genuine relationship with her. Her goal is to be proficient at subtraction so that she can get a job that involves financial management. I learned to adapt my teaching skills to her learning style, become an effective communicator and leader, and most importantly, strategize to help her reach her goals. Watching her improve and gain confidence in her math skills has been a humbling experience for me. Increasing the levels of education in my community will advance social and economic equity, and improving health among other social issues affecting people. As a future physician, I will have this experience in mind and use the knowledge that I gained to communicate with my patients while continuing to promote literacy and, in turn, health.",,,1,"The pandemic resulted in the cancellation of my summer internship.

2023,15509727,,23,Woman,USA,1,EO2,0,1,"Although I grew up in an area that had abundant resources, my family experienced many financial difficulties that prevented our access to these resources.

Since I was a child, my parents have worked 8-hour shifts every day, with the exception of Sundays. Even with their hard work, we received assistance via food stamps and were on Medicaid.

Not everyone sees it that way. It’s your responsibility to advocate for them at the hospital,” said the paramedic to me during my first ride-a-long. As I reflect on the experiences that brought me to medicine’s doorstep, I recognize how these words informed my philosophy of medicine. Through schooling, we acquire the academic prowess necessary to diagnose and the clinical technique to carry out treatments. On the other hand, no textbook teaches you the interpersonal skills that lay the groundwork for a patient encounter. You develop these through your experiences with others, and for me, I learned about patient advocacy in the unorthodox environment of a first-generation immigrant home. 

With English not being their first language, my parents relied on me as an interpreter to navigate their daily lives. Whether that be at the bank, a parent-teacher conference, or a doctor’s appointment, I was mediating all their essential conversations. One specific memory that comes to mind is when my sister was diagnosed with Turner’s Syndrome during my senior year of high school. As the doctor discussed the findings of the karyotype and her labs, my parents’ faces were contorted with worry and confusion. The doctor recognized this, so she spoke in basic terms, then allowed brief pauses so that I could relay it to my parents. Despite the uncertainty that accompanied the next several hospital visits, that initial interaction was a defining moment for me. From this, I learned the first tenet of patient advocacy was to ensure that patients are, and have a right to be, informed throughout the entire process. Although my amateur translating seemed trivial, I realized that it was a necessary role so that my parents would be included in the conversation. 

The following year, I attended college and was confronted with the big decision of figuring out my career path. To explore the pre-medical pathway, I applied to Tulane EMS, albeit with some hesitation and anxiety. Being an EMT was something I could have never imagined myself doing. I assumed there was no place for a small, quiet girl who was lacking the physical strength and tough attitude that was a prerequisite for emergency medicine. Yet, on one of my first calls, I became aware of the role my emotional strengths could play. We arrived on scene to a patient with a depressed skull fracture. As I held her head for manual stabilization, I could see the fear in her eyes. Her shock was evident as she watched us apply a cervical collar, put her on a spine board, and moved her into the ambulance. During the transport, she began to cry, asking about what was going to happen to her now. I consoled her and patiently explained the circumstances. I held her hand while my partner took vitals, in hopes it would quell a little bit of the fear. By the time we arrived on the ramp, she was smiling and laughing with us. It became clear to me what the value of compassion in medicine was.

After many more experiences in EMS, I declared my major in neuroscience to jumpstart my journey. During the first semester of my junior year, I was given the opportunity to be a Supplemental Instructor for a Cellular Neuroscience class. Although a foundational class, I knew that the content could be daunting. My dedication to their learning was exemplified by the time I spent creating study resources, providing recorded lectures, and holding office hours. I still remember how fulfilled I felt when a student personally messaged me to say that attending my review sessions and using my resources had brought her grade up significantly. Just as a student needs an encouraging environment to succeed, a patient requires a support network during their treatment regimen. I hope to apply the same diligence in a clinical setting, so that my patients feel empowered throughout their healing process. 

Consequently, I had the privilege of seeing this healing process when I was an Emergency Department Technician at Ochsner Medical Center. I was not only able to observe doctors conduct primary assessments and derive their differential diagnoses, but I was assisting them in doing so. This experience also stressed to me the importance of quality medicine in patient populations rife with comorbidity. It was sobering to see patients in critical condition due to poor lifestyle choices or financial constraints, thus emphasizing to me the practicality of preventative healthcare. I was also inspired in my work with psychiatric patients to speak up for those whose conditions are stigmatized. We owe all our patients the same respect and dignity, regardless of their social location or circumstances outside their control.

Deciding to pursue medicine was not a simple revelation for me. Instead, it was a progression of experiences that I was fortunate enough to have. Through my interactions with patients in clinical settings, I have become keener to the realities of the human existence and the responsibilities that doctors hold. Everyone deserves to have a provider in the room who respects their best interests. I look forward to receiving a medical education that enables me to advocate for underserved populations, while remaining kind and empathetic throughout.","As a volunteer EMT and an ED technician, I encountered patients who could not access preventative care due to financial barriers, low health literacy, or medical mistrust. Furthermore, these patients belonged to marginalized groups, whose identities intersected across lines of race, gender, and sexuality. The effects of this would be reflected in their medical history, often riddled with comorbidities that were poorly managed. Without access to basic primary care, these patients would only present to the emergency room when their conditions became acute. This experience elucidated the disparities that afflict disadvantaged communities and the role that healthcare providers play in resolving these issues. Physicians are leaders within their field, experts in their medical studies, and patient educators, but most importantly, they can be advocates for change. Thus, I aim to be a physician who employs an intersectional perspective when providing equitable, quality care.","During the summer of 2020, I remember watching as the nation experienced a turning point. The George Floyd protests emphasized the inequities that Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) face daily, and I recognized these same inequities were reflected in my EMS organization. Over the years, many BIPOC members raised an issue with the organization‚Äôs protocols, but with limited success. As a result, there was a high attrition rate for these members, both unfair to them and our diverse patient population. To address this, I gathered BIPOC members within my cohort and drafted a proposal to present to our executive board. The proposal detailed changes to the protocols, such as a zero-tolerance discrimination policy, mandatory cultural workshops, and revision of our selection process. Following the protocol reform, there was a positive shift within the organization, and our patient community benefited from our more inclusive practices. ",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic reached New Orleans, I was asked to move out of my dorm. Right before this occurred, I had begun a job at the Tulane Financial Aid office and a volunteer position at Children‚Äôs Hospital New Orleans. However, I had to put these commitments on hold and was not able to return due to COVID restrictions. Once I returned home, I was responsible for attending online classes while providing full-time care for my younger sister, since my parents continued to work. After returning to school in the fall, I began a research position but unfortunately could not continue since it was unpaid. I had to pay rent for off-campus housing, so I sought out a different job that could better address my financial needs. I began working as a supplemental instructor for a semester and after, I was an ED technician. Additionally, I continued volunteering for Tulane EMS, providing emergency care and also transporting COVID-positive students to quarantine facilities.",1,0,2

I was hopeful, but cautious. I had been in and out of doctor’s offices for years and had a previous endoscopy four years earlier that was inconclusive. I had a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that doctors couldn’t seem to solve. After my endoscopy, my parents took me to get food while I yearned to be at the soccer game that I missed that day. Throughout my childhood, my gastrointestinal illness repeatedly separated me from my first love, sports. Whether it was due to feeling sick or having a doctor’s appointments, I missed countless basketball and soccer games or practices, all while aching to be on the court or field with my friends. 

The doctors concluded from my endoscopy that I had IBS. Over the course of the following year, I adjusted my diet and lifestyle, with the help of my gastroenterologist, so that I could manage my IBS and enjoy sports again. My experiences with IBS provided my first exposure to the medical field and revealed a desire in me to help others with chronic conditions so that they also could return to the lifestyles they once treasured. However, I was not sure in what capacity I would be able to do so. 

As I entered college, I was able to pursue my love for sports through an Exercise and Sports Science major and managing the UNC Men’s JV basketball team, convinced that I wanted to be an athletic trainer or physical therapist. My classes instilled in me the value of exercise on the well-being of an individual and showed me that there are many factors affecting one’s health. My experience as a manager allowed me to work in a fast-paced environment, learn how to problem solve in a variety of circumstances, and become a flexible and reliable teammate to other managers. With nightly practices and games each Saturday, I gained time management skills by efficiently balancing my full-time school and work schedules. During my sophomore year, I was able to strengthen my communication skills, acting as head manager for a group of over twenty JV managers, delegating tasks and coordinating between coaches, referees, and the UNC JV team.  

It wasn’t until my junior year of college that I began to consider medicine as a future career. During that fall semester, I volunteered at a local non-profit, A Helping Hand, providing home healthcare for older adults under the poverty line. As I formed connections with each of my clients, I witnessed how they were treated in a society that primarily caters to younger generations and learned of the biases they face from medical professionals. One of my clients, Mrs. R, faced a mobility impairment and was unable to drive, so I was her only access to leaving her senior-living apartment each week and her only assistance with in-house chores. I recall her apartment, with smoke stains soaked into the carpet and walls, dirty dishes piled in the sink, magazines, food, and various trash cluttering the floor, and the odor of weeks-old food and cat litter. All of this was due to her immobility, not due to her lack of care for the apartment. One day, she expressed how she missed being physically active and felt that her doctors believed that she didn’t care enough to improve her condition since she often missed doctor’s appointments due to her immobility. She made me aware of my own biases, and I realized how much her handicap inadvertently negatively impacted her already poor health. Being able to go directly into the homes of my clients enabled me to see how medical status, living conditions, socioeconomic class, and race are interrelated in the overall health of an individual. After this internship, I desired to make a change in the healthcare provided to older adults or disadvantaged populations, and I wanted to be the provider my clients deserved. 

Since my junior year of college, I have participated in various health-related environments, like COVID testing sites on campus and most recently, working as a medical assistant at a dermatology office. Teenagers with acne, older adults with skin cancers, babies with eczema, men and women struggling with hair loss, and people of all ages with obscure rashes are just a glimpse of patients I get to meet daily. Every day, I am excited and gripped by the various patient cases. Most importantly, I’m able to witness the joy, relief, and gratitude of the patients as they are treated for their chronic cystic acne, skin cancers, lifelong eczema or psoriasis, alopecia, and even something as rare as a dermatitis herpetiformis rash. Being a physician means improving the quality of life and being a difference maker in the lives of all patients, and I want to be a part of that. 

My passions for health, service, learning, hard work and interpersonal relationships drive my desire to make an impact as a physician, both in and out of the clinic. Whether my career involves assisting athletes’ in recovering from sports injuries, providing primary care to geriatric populations, aiding disadvantaged communities, or delivering dermatological care, I will seek to leverage my career to provide the greatest care, compassion, and service offerable, thus fulfilling my true calling as a doctor.","He was just another patient that I pulled back on a busy Tuesday afternoon. I brought Mr. W to his patient room and asked about his concerns for his dermatology visit. While walking out of the room after obtaining his information, I complimented the necklace Mr. W was wearing. As he thanked me, I noticed he got choked up. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just my partner gave me this necklace, and he just passed away two months ago.‚Äù I immediately extended my apologies and stayed in the room as he confessed his difficulties in coping with grief. When giving Dr. L the chief complaint for Mr. W after leaving the room, I informed her of Mr. W‚Äôs loss. During the visit, Dr. L also empathized with Mr. W and allowed him to express his emotions. Even though Dr. L didn‚Äôt share a similar experience, Dr. L offered emotional support and got to know Mr. W on a level more than just a physical illness. This showed me the criticality of compassionate care, and I aim to treat my patients similarly in the future.","Through an internship, I provided home care to older adults below the poverty line. Caring for my two clients, Ms. R and Ms. S, allowed me to improve their quality of life in unique ways. Each Wednesday, I was responsible for assisting Ms. R in running errands such as attending doctor‚Äôs appointments, going to the bank, grocery shopping, or even cleaning her apartment, as her lack of mobility limited all aspects of her life. By helping her with these seemingly ordinary tasks, I reduced the stress Ms. R experienced and contributed to Ms. R feeling more in control of her life. On the other hand, Ms. S exposed me to the difficulties older adults face in forming genuine relationships with those around them, especially if they live in younger cities or have no family nearby. Ms. S often confided in me how lonely she felt, and by spending time with her each week, I was able to provide the companionship that she desired and a listening ear. As a result, Ms. S felt more seen and valued.",,,1,"COVID-19 dramatically changed my education during my junior year of college; within weeks, my classes adopted a virtual format and I moved to my hometown. At this time, I faced the challenges of developing relationships with professors and classmates while adjusting to life at home for the first time in three years. Once I returned to campus my senior year, I was eager to become involved on campus again. Although opportunities were limited, I volunteered in a virtual balance class for older adults and during my second semester, I volunteered at testing sites on campus. COVID-19 created many changes, but it also allowed me to respond with resilience and reflect on why I want to be a doctor, which has better prepared me for medical school.",0,1,1

My foray into public health began during my undergraduate studies. Despite working full-time, I reserved time to pursue my interest. One of which was grassroots development, leading me to join Clear Vision Eau Claire. The organization focused on using democracy to address a community-identified issue. My life-long hobby of gardening inspired me to join the healthy lifestyle group. Our goal was simple. To expand community gardens in low-income neighborhoods to increase access to fresh produce. After a year of planning and advocacy, our efforts paid off. The new garden on Halfmoon Lake produced some of the sweetest melons I had ever tasted. Hungry for more, I became a research assistant for a project studying fruit and vegetable consumption in children. Our team studied the effects of health promotion and token-economy incentives. Our interventions led to healthier food choices. I wanted to continue exploring careers that would allow me to use the scientific method to improve health at the population level.  

After graduating, I joined the Peace Corps to begin my career in public health and community development. My job as a Community Health Promoter took me to Develdt, a small village of about 300 Arawak people deep in the hinterlands of Guyana. There I worked with the only healthcare provider, a Midwife named Leah. The river serves as the only road in the community. Leah and I would paddle a dugout canoe in the hot equatorial sun to our patients’ homes. During one trip, we visited an antenatal patient, “Mia,” in her second trimester. We noticed her blood pressure had increased by 40 mmHg since our last visit. She was diagnosed with preeclampsia. Mia’s midwife immediately referred her to the nearest hospital. Despite our daily pleas for her to seek a higher level of care, Mia’s next trip to the hospital would end at the morgue. Comfort cares and prayers were the only interventions we could provide on the long boat ride to the hospital. Witnessing her preventable death profoundly impacted me, and I still struggle to identify all the emotions associated with that day. However, I realized the privilege of being trusted to provide care and support for Mia and her family. For the first time, I began considering a clinical career rather than focusing solely on public health.

Shortly after Mia’s death, I had to leave Develdt due to a security concern. I had two options: return to the United States or continue my service at a new site. I was devastated to leave Develdt but knew I had to finish my commitment. My second assignment took me to the Venezuela-Guyana border. The Mabaruma Regional Hospital was a small 28-bed facility with four physicians and eight nurses. I developed close friendships with my colleagues while living in the hospital compound. We would lime and gaff (hang out) every night until the mosquitoes became unbearable. These friendships instilled me with the confidence to pursue medicine. In the hospital, it was clear that the physician’s expertise improved patient outcomes. With their knowledge, they could navigate the challenging, low-resource environment better. I would wonder what would have happened to Mia if a physician had been stationed less than a four-hour boat ride away. My experience in Mabaruma fortified my decision to pursue medicine. When I joined the Peace Corps, I promised to serve where needed most, and I fully intend to continue this promise and aspire to address the need for rural physicians in America. 

Following my successful Peace Corps experience, I continued my commitment to service at the Department of Veteran Affairs. To better understand American hospitals, I became a ward clerk. The physicians I worked with in the traumatic brain injury ward supported my desire to further my education. They were always enthusiastic about explaining patients’ imaging and how their lesions presented. During my time on the wards, I was inspired by the physicians’ role of not only clinically managing patients but also the expectations of their loved ones. Their knowledge allowed them to provide both realistic hope and ample comfort. Seeing the humanistic art of medicine in America would further my resolve to study medicine.   

After three years of clinical experience abroad and stateside, I was eager to begin my post-baccalaureate studies. I excelled academically and professionally while working full-time. While studying, I was able to earn three promotions during my four-year tenure. Going back to school and pursuing medicine in my late twenties was not a decision I made lightly. My experience caring for patients helped me further understand and develop the incredible emotional resiliency required of me as a physician. My Peace Corps service taught me despite hardship, quality education is enduring. This knowledge propelled me on my journey of obtaining the most extensive clinical education possible. I look forward to continuing as a lifelong learner. I want to continue using my experiences in public health, civic engagement, and capacity building to improve health for the individual and the community.","For 27 months, I lived and worked with two Amerindian (indigenous) tribes of South America while serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer. During this time, I lived with an Amerindian host family, which further increased my understanding of the Amerindian community._x000D_
_x000D_
I worked hard to always conduct myself with respect to the culture and took the time to learn about the tribe's history and culture. I immersed myself in my community to make friends and was rarely alone. I spent every night and day playing volleyball, football, or chatting with my neighbors. Much to their glee, I learned many traditional crafts, including making bread and wine from cassava, weaving tibisiri into hammocks, and carving the pits of fruits into jewelry. I learned that I had the maturity to adapt to new situations and maintained a professional demeanor in a new culture during even challenging circumstances. I also learned to be more open-minded to other cultures. ","As a Peace Corps Volunteer working in Guyana, South America, I had many projects related to improving the capacity of healthcare delivery by integrating technology for development. However, one of my favorite projects was focused on improving the educational outcomes of students at the Mabaruma Secondary School. There was a shortage of qualified mathematics teachers living in the remote community, and students at the secondary school struggled to pass their national examination to enter competitive studies at the university. I partnered with local business and the foundation for learning inequality to setup an offline server that made Khan Academy accessible for any student with a smart phone (a resource almost every student had). Students to this day are still utilizing the Khan Academy server and have reported greater pass rates on the national university entrance exam. ",,,1,,1,0,3

I have already packed my tent, food, and clothes, but I still need to make sure I have space for hand sanitizer, soap, twice as much clean water as everyone else, and a hefty supply of urinary catheters to last a week. These types of concerns, however odd, have dominated how I think for years. I was born with bladder exstrophy requiring several surgeries starting at birth and continuing over the next few years of my life. Those surgeries included forming an augmented bladder with my small intestine, closing my urethra, and re-implanting my ureters to decrease reflux. Even with these surgeries I had to learn how to use catheters from an early age to be independent at home, school, and elsewhere.

From the start of elementary school, I worried about fitting in. I didn’t want others to know I had anything wrong with me, so I kept my medical problems from my classmates. To do this, I had to plan my days around going to the bathroom frequently to prevent infections. I needed to know where bathrooms were located and how I would use a communal sink and stalls without my fellow classmates finding out about my condition. Such planning from a young age was difficult and at times stressful.

Aside from these difficulties, I also wondered if I would be able to do all the things everyone else did around me. These concerns were washed away as my doctors not only provided me ways to succeed physically, but also mentally. They encouraged me and assured me that I was indeed capable of living a normal life, and they explained how I could do so. I still plan out my days, flush out my bladder frequently, and fight occasional UTIs, but because of the care provided by my physicians I was able to conquer many challenges like going on my weeklong 50-mile hiking trip. Thanks to the help of my physicians, I was able to run track, play tennis and baseball, and live a very fulfilling, active life, despite my urologic challenges. My physicians inspired me to want to heal others both physically and mentally to enable them to live the healthiest and most fulfilling lives possible.

My desire to pursue medicine and serve others propelled me to get hands on experience serving people in a hospital setting. This led me to a job as a patient care technician in the mother-baby unit. As the only male in an all-female team taking care of newborns and new mothers, I quickly learned how to put patients at ease and overcome some of their initial discomfort in working with a male caregiver. This unit of the hospital, like others, was accompanied by a variety of emotions. From the joy of birth to the sadness in loss, or anxiety from health complications. At times a child was separated from their mother to attend to a birth complication or medical need; this was always very trying for the mother. In these nerve-racking moments real healing was more about receiving peace of mind than any kind of medication for sleep or pain. I learned the critical role that clear communication and knowledge had in giving peace of mind. When a mother knew in real time what treatment her child was receiving and how it would help, her stress was reduced. Only then could she relax enough to begin healing herself. Assisting in this process strengthened my previous resolve to help provide physical and emotional healing to others.

After learning about the powerful effect that knowledge can have on a patient, I developed and carried out an education project with Central Utah Early Intervention. This project addressed an alarming increase in the number of children with severe delays in communication and social interaction skills as they entered preschool. I visited over 20 physician offices in underserved areas of rural Utah to spread awareness of this growing issue and to provide education for physicians. This included how to access support services like early intervention programs, and a speech milestone handout for parents to track their child’s progress. As I provided this education, I was surprised by the relief expressed by physicians who saw these developmental delays on a daily basis but were unsure how to access support in their area. My desire to provide healthcare equity as a physician grew as I saw the sincere love that physicians felt for their patients in these small communities.

My personal experiences with medicine have allowed me to lead an active and fulfilling life. Those experiences integrated with my time working in the hospital have fortified my inclination to attend to the physical, mental, and emotional needs of others. Additional growth has come to me by participating in several extracurricular activities including the work I carried out with those in rural areas of Utah suffering from speech delays, illuminating research at the Mayo Clinic to improve future care of patients with heart failure, providing interpretation for Spanish speaking patients at a free clinic, and more. I am eager for the opportunities to help those in need that would come to me as a physician, and am confident, based on my life experiences so far, that I will be able to overcome any challenges that would come my way.","I served for two years as a missionary for my church in Boston, MA. I was assigned to Spanish speaking communities which necessitated learning a new language. I helped with their physical needs, assisting them to find housing and employment as many were immigrants from the Caribbean and Central America. I learned to appreciate their stories, diversity, and courage in overcoming so many obstacles to obtain a better life for their family. To continue using Spanish to help others I interpreted at a clinic that gave free medical care to those who were under 150% of federal poverty level. I learned about their health, financial, and cultural challenges. I found that each patient had a distinct story to tell and wanted their voice to be heard. By listening to and relaying their unique circumstances to physicians many obtained the care they needed. I have learned to love and value diverse cultures. I also learned that simply listening can often be the most impactful way to help someone.","I completed an outreach project in coordination with Central Utah Early Intervention for rural central Utah when I learned about severe communication and interaction delays for children entering school; delays so severe they were being qualified for special education. I visited over 20 clinics to provide access to early intervention programs, including home visits, as well as speech milestones for parents. During this time, I spoke with several physicians about the difficulties they faced in terms of support, and the necessity of treating a variety of things because they are the only resource for their patients. I was impressed with the love they had for their communities helping as many as they can to experience healthcare equity. This population health project has provided a meaningful resource for physicians to share with families to receive in home treatment at little to no cost. I hope this project will turn the tide for speech delays and prevent such severity in the future.",,,1,"Due to the pandemic, patient interactions, physician shadowing, and research opportunities were limited. Though I was able to work as a patient care technician in a mother/baby unit, I wanted to participate in several varied experiences. I learned that to get these experiences I had to be more flexible in what I was looking for and participating in. I also had to be much more persistent and creative to find and participate in opportunities with ever changing COVID restrictions. Even after an experience was set, requirements of the facility or practitioner would change. With creativity, persistence, and flexibility I was still able to experience a wide variety of opportunities including: becoming a COVID screener at the emergency room entrance and at the Red Cross, creating and implementing a speech and language delay awareness drive, shadowing several physicians, participating in research at two institutions, and presenting research at the ACSM conference in San Diego.",1,0,2

Moreover, the appearance of my parent’s income on paper meant that we were not able to apply for government assistance programs. Our means have been even further stressed since the advent of my father’s illness, thus limiting my access to educational, personal, and professional opportunities. Although my parents prioritized education, the lack of institutional investment in public schools in our neighborhood meant I had more barriers to receive what others had innately. Thus I have had a lifetime of traveling further, fighting for scholarships, and maintaining employment to keep up with my peers. While I have been successful in my pursuit of higher education, I have also experienced isolation, exclusion, and microaggressions in these spaces due to differences in my racial and socioeconomic statuses.

In hindsight however, they laid the perfect foundation to lead me to this career, by demonstrating in their lives how fulfilling a life of service can be. 
I first began to think about medicine as my life of service, when my father became chronically ill as I left high school. In the free time that my father gained due to his sarcoidosis, he reflected deeply on his life and realized that he wanted to build stronger relationships with his children. Medicine has indeed served my father by sustaining his physical being; however, this is just a proxy. At the heart of it, medicine has given my father a second chance at cultivating the parts of his life that he has deemed meaningful to him. I believe that medicine is the ultimate act of service to society because by transforming an individual’s health, they may now have the potential to transform so much more in their life. I am driven to practice medicine because of its power to create stronger communities filled with individuals who are able to focus on things meaningful to them. 
My father’s illness led me to the pre-med classes that developed my deep curiosity for science, but it was in my psychology research experiences where I began to uncover the values I want to uphold as a doctor. Working on a research study where participants shared their different beliefs and habits about sexual health, I found myself thinking about how if I was their doctor, I would need to tailor conversations to best encourage safe sex practices. Inspired by this experience, I desire to become a doctor because in this career I will have the privilege of building personalized partnerships with my patients, through learning about their individual lifestyles, needs, and beliefs. However, I believe these partnerships are more than a privilege; they are a necessity to provide high quality healthcare. As a physician, I will champion individualized medicine guided by partnerships with my patients not only because it leads to more effective treatment, but because patients deserve to feel empowered. 
While I believe that contributing to research is an act of dedication to the human community at large, in an effort to support individuals’ health more directly, I joined Health Bridges. This organization is dedicated to improving health equity in Pomona, California by enrolling uninsured individuals for temporary insurance in their native language. Towards the end of my time with this program, I assisted a man who was being treated for a broken arm. As I began to speak to him, he told me quite hastily in Spanish that he did not care about whatever I was trying to sell him. As I learned to become more resilient throughout my time in this program, I introduced myself and expressed my concern for his injury. Once he became more receptive, I engaged in a discussion with him about the program. I patiently helped him to understand what the program entailed, ultimately leading to him expressing a desire to enroll. For this patient and all others, this work truly resonated with me, especially as the reality is that my father, who is unable to work, could have been one of the patients I enrolled, if not for being married. I intend to provide high-quality healthcare to underserved communities as a physician, always actively promoting access to healthcare across socioeconomic and language barriers. 
In my current role as a liaison between the physicians and patients at Generation Next Fertility (GNF), I have built on the clinical skills first fostered by Health Bridges. My second time on-call I was presented with a critical issue - a woman in an IVF cycle who needed to take her trigger shots in thirty minutes did not have one of them at home. Immediately, my mind began whirling - Should the dosage of the medication be changed? What was her nearest fertility pharmacy? How would taking it late affect her egg retrieval? After contacting the on-call physician, I evaluated and determined the best action, making sure to keep the patient informed and calm. Everyday I witness the physicians at GNF similarly use critical thinking skills in patient care. I have long known medicine requires an adeptness towards analyzing symptoms to determine a diagnosis and exhibiting strong judgment towards the most appropriate treatment. My time at GNF has taught me that while being excellent in this regard is a fundamental need, good medicine transcends this and requires strong listening skills, a commitment to continuous learning, and a curious and innovative mindset. 
These experiences have led me to understand that as a physician, my goal will be to work in partnerships with patients, delivering high-quality healthcare that is defined by empathy, creativity and persistence. Seeking to build stronger communities, I will prioritize delivering healthcare to underserved populations, while also conducting research that improves the health of future communities. Above all, as I go through this journey, what I hope to “put my mind to” the most, as my father would say, is always continuously learning and improving, in service to my future patients.","At Generation Next Fertility, I have seen one particular patient complete egg retrievals for months, but not be successful in having forming embryos. With this context, her physician has inquired about whether the patient was open to egg donation, which would give her a much higher chance at pregnancy. However, the patient informed us of the taboos that surround egg donation in her culture and that specifically her mother had expressed extreme displeasure with her daughter pursuing this. This was hard for me to hear because it would be the choice I would make if I was the patient. However, it was easier to understand after she confided in me that her relationship with her mother and her culture were the most important things in her life and she would never want to jeopardize that. This patient helped me to understand that if an individual‚Äôs values or choices do not align with mine, it is important that I trust that they are making the most beneficial decision for their own life. ","In college, I led a partnership with a Tongan Community group to provide events focused on COVID and vaccine empowerment. This occurred around the time that vaccines were being rolled out and the community that we were working with expressed hesitancy over receiving them. While it brought me immense satisfaction to apply my scientific knowledge to present the technicalities of the vaccines, I found that the conversations we had after the presentation were just as important. Here, we discussed specific fears community members had and shared our personal stories why we believed it was important to become vaccinated. I also believe that the time we spent building a relationship with the community over the course of the semester played a major role in building up their community‚Äôs trust. Ultimately, I am proud to not just have played a part in increasing the vaccination rate in this community, but making sure that these community members felt secure in their health choices.

In the spring of 2009, my best friend, Alexa, got into a biking accident that left her in a four-month coma. Peeking over the Blue Bell tub, I attempted to decipher my parents’ medical jargon, but only felt more powerless. For the next few months, I visited Alexa every other day. I can still smell the sterile PICU and see the maze of cords connected to her little body. I was so visibly distraught on one such visit that I attracted the attention of Alexa’s doctor. Crouching down so she was at eye level with me, she explained that while she was treating Alexa’s brain, I had the important task of treating her soul by being with her. At the time, I had no idea what that meant; however, the understanding that I could help Alexa get better by keeping her company cheered me up considerably. After 4 months, she woke with partial paralysis. Alexa and I became inseparable to the point that I attended her weekly speech and physical therapy sessions with her for over a year. It wasn’t until I was about to move away for college that Alexa’s mother spoke life-altering words: “Alexa is alive because of you. I know doctors treated her after the accident, but if you were not with her through her recovery, I don’t think she would have had a reason to improve.” This experience was my proverbial call to action–both sparking my interest in the biological sciences and inspiring me to pursue a career in medicine. 

Years later while shadowing Dr. Barnett, a neurosurgeon, I noticed his disposition was reflective of mine with Alexa. Without speaking a word, the palpable helplessness of each patient faded with Dr. Barnett’s infectious tranquility. He taught me that the understanding between a doctor and their patient is not only to fix them physically but to be their ally through their entire health journey. Doctors require not only empathy and compassion but a stillness that resonates with others. Contrary to my previous beliefs, healing one’s body and soul don’t have to be separate endeavors and in fact, the best doctors are ones who couple these processes. Using my experiences with Alexa and Dr. Barnett, my presence as a physician will be more than treating patients’ health conditions but making sure they don’t lose themselves in the process.

While I primarily feel grateful for Alexa’s awakening, I also remain perplexed by her body’s recovery. To address my curiosity about the human body, I joined Dr. Li’s lab, which explores the microbiome’s impact on diseases. I quickly grasped how much the human condition remains unexplored, igniting a new appreciation for the sciences. Working under Dr. Li and collaborating with other labs in similar fields, I worked to computationally analyze bacterial DNA fragments collected by the lab’s undergraduate and graduate students. Our different backgrounds allowed us to approach our research question from various angles to more comprehensively interpret our data. This taught me that the effort of an individual doesn’t compare to a collective of diverse researchers. This lab’s unity primed me for the collaboration between physicians of independent specialties: individually as an element and together as a solution.

To explore my artistic passions, I joined the Fashion and Student Trends club with the intention of being a stylist. It became apparent that the closest I would get to directly working with clothes was through modeling, which entailed a task I was entirely unfamiliar with and apprehensive about: a runway show in front of a thousand people. I knew I would regret abandoning my interests for fear of failure, so I learned how to walk a runway. The six months of practicing and preparing for the show required my development and dependability, as I needed to receive, understand, and execute critiques. Furthermore, one model’s absence would interfere with the show’s execution. When I was given the role of opening the show, my returning fear quickly subsided with confirmation of my significant progress. Through collaborating with the designers and adjusting to their last-minute changes, I had the honor of giving life to lines with unique cultural references and stylistic techniques. My designers counted on my resilience, reliability, and willingness to grow, all of which are traits that patients count on their doctors to possess. 

After witnessing Alexa’s recovery, I realized that the complexity of humans goes beyond our physicality and involves an elaborate network of feelings, conflicts, and overcomings. Unlike cars, people cannot go into a shop broken and come out repaired. We do not come with manuals, because, as the central lesson of medicine, simplicity is not a part of our nature. It’s a doctor's job to use patients’ unique backgrounds, experiences, and communication methods not only to make diagnoses but also in approaching patient interactions. It’s a doctor’s job to constantly broaden their knowledge bank. It’s a doctor’s job to treat their patient and not just their condition. To those entrusted with this responsibility, I want to say thank you, and I hope to someday provide another 8-year-old with the courage to treat their friend’s soul.","This summer, I studied abroad in Spain where I met a local, Cami, who soon became a close friend. Cami embodied the vibrant and warm culture in Spain. On our way back from a waterfall hike, we lost the path in the darkness, so I attempted to find my way back. Once I realized Cami wasn‚Äôt following me, I walked over to see her laying on the ground looking at the stars. ‚ÄúCami, we need to find out way back before it gets too late,‚Äù I explain to her. Cami replied, ‚ÄúThe path isn‚Äôt going to get up and walk away. Besides, it‚Äôs already dark, so what‚Äôre 15 minutes to find all the constellations.‚Äù Laying down for nearly an hour, we identified all the major constellations and even named a few of our own. At that moment, I didn‚Äôt understand how nonchalant she was about losing our way, but now I realize that, for her, being lost was an adventure, not a setback. This mindset has even become a part of my current mentality in dealing with small inconveniences, as it sets a more positive light on life._x000D_
","During a shift as a Care Extender volunteer at Ronald Reagan, I was transferring Mr. Torres, a patient, while he divulged the stories of his youth and the inspiration behind his poetry. He had an undiagnosed illness yet was unphased in spite of it, showing no fear and incredible resilience. He said, ‚ÄúElla, if I can pass on just one grain of my mistakes and lessons to you, then I‚Äôll be satisfied with my outcome.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut then they wouldn‚Äôt be my lessons to learn,‚Äù I told him. Mr. Torres laughed and said, ‚ÄúI wish I could have heard that earlier, and maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have made so many mistakes with my children.‚Äù I told him that there was no time like the present, and soon after, Mr. Torres contacted his children who he had previously not wanted to bother. On my next shift, I met his daughter and was given a signed copy of his poetry book. Although I may have helped motivate Mr. Torres to repair some of his relationships, he reminded me that my mistakes are a necessary part of my own journey.",,,1,"I quarantined with my cousin, Faven, who only left her room at night to ensure that I was still breathing. The isolation quickly dismantled her mental condition which had been restored for 15 years since her parents were killed during the Ethiopian Civil war. Her theories about the threats to our lives could not be eliminated by logic. To her, I needed protection from anyone else that entered the house, including my parents. Every day, I watched my free-spirited cousin get replaced with someone consumed with fear and anxiety. During our one-sided conversations, I attempted to pull every thread that reminded her of our safety, but I was always left with unraveled string. This experience entirely altered the way that I viewed the triggers of the human psyche, and it gave me another array of mysteries that I craved to solve through the pursuit of medicine.

Early that morning my mom would take my older brother to her office for a brain MRI. My father drove separately so he could take him back to school after the scan. He never attended class that day. My aunt pulled me out of school and explained on our drive to Mott Children’s Hospital that my brother had a brain tumor that needed to be removed. So vividly, I remember the first time I laid eyes on him. Surrounded by loud equipment, he had on a hospital gown and what seemed like one hundred tubes protruding from his body. My older brother, the one that was always able to best me in everything, was defenseless. What troubled me further was seeing my parents, two doctors who seemed to always know what to do, so helpless and vulnerable. I ran out of his room terrified, refusing to go back no matter how much my parents begged. I remained this way until one of the nurses approached me. Smiling confidently, she sat next to me and held out her hand, to which I stared for a while before taking hold. For what felt like an eternity, I sat crying as she wiped away each successive round of tears and mucous from my cheeks. That simple display of compassion by that nurse gave me the courage to rejoin my family and support my brother. Over his two-year battle with cancer, it was the countless incredible experiences like this from the staff at Mott that ultimately convinced me becoming a doctor was what I should spend the rest of my life working towards. 

Getting great grades is important, but a doctor is so much more than a book-smart individual. Recognizing this, I made the commitment to dedicate my free time at college to improving skills beyond excelling academically. I took on a job as a laborer to a group of bricklayers, not really knowing what to expect. I knew the work would be hard, but I never expected the experience to be so meaningful. My crewmates were comprised of mostly immigrants, many of whom lived paycheck to paycheck. Each second I wasted on the job was food off their table. This motivated me to work harder than I knew I was capable of, and the crew quickly took notice. They gave me pay raises and let me work longer hours, but the money was not nearly as valuable as the experience. Many of the workers opened up to me about their struggles. They spoke about the pain they put up with each day due to working this labor-intensive job, and how they refused medical care as they could not afford it. Reflecting on their stories of struggle I often asked myself, “what did I do to deserve the privileges I have grown up with?” The answer is, “not enough.” Therefore, I chose to commit every ounce of my time to becoming a doctor so I can provide care for people like my crewmembers who need it most. So I can make an impact in the lives of those who have less. So I can one day answer this question about my privilege differently. 

The countless hours I dedicated to clinical care opened my eyes to the joy of personally assisting patients in their journey to better health. As a physical therapy technician, I thoroughly enjoyed leading the patients I worked with through their strenuous exercise regimens. It was difficult at times to see their faces of discomfort as I challenged them to push past their comfort zone. What made it absolutely worth it, was having the privilege of witnessing their improvement with each successive day of therapy. I was pleased with how natural I felt in the clinical setting and took pride in the care I administered. Throughout my summers as a technician, I often reflected on the feeling of gratitude I had towards the staff at Mott for all they had done for my family. The thought that the patients I worked with felt a shard of this sentiment towards me overwhelms me with happiness and motivates me to continue my journey to becoming a doctor. 

The goal of contributing to the discovery of information that has the potential to improve millions of lives has motivated me to do research at the Henke Cardiovascular Laboratory. Much like building a house, research is no one-person job. I appreciate the collaborative nature of research, never wasting an opportunity to pick the brains of the many knowledgeable doctors and staff on my lab team. My favorite part of research is not running a successful experiment, but rather figuring out why an experiment failed. Those exciting aha moments where I catch my mistakes make up many of the valuable lessons I have learned throughout my time at the Henke Lab. 

These past four years I have taken on many roles beyond student. Through my commitment to research, patient care, and labor amongst other things, I have developed the skills necessary to overcome the many challenges the future holds. There is not a day that goes by in which I fail to recognize the pivotal role my support networks have played in building who I am today. I am so thankful for the experiences I have had, and the relationships I have formed. In my professional career, I strongly desire to make an impact in the lives of others, just as so many have done for me. I desire to know on my last day that I spent my life doing something meaningful. I am certain this desire will best be fulfilled by becoming a doctor and will do everything in my power to achieve it.","Working alongside many union workers in downtown Detroit during my time at Metros Masonry broadened my worldview. Diverse in age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, I had the privilege of growing close to people whose lives were radically different than mine. Hearing their stories of struggle made me feel out of place, as my biggest problems paled in comparison to their challenges. I told this to one worker whom I had grown especially close, for which he shared a perspective that I often reflect on. He said, ""Antonio, for everyone in this world, their biggest problem is their biggest problem"". He was explaining that though we all grow up differently, with struggles unique to each individual, the emotion that accompanies those struggles are the same. Sadness, excitement, and fear are emotions we all feel, though they may be elicited through different means. This is what makes us human and why regardless of who we are or where we come from, we are certainly more alike than different. ","Through my role as a physical therapist technician, I have helped restore movement to hundreds of patients. This role is very hands-on, requiring my full attention throughout the entirety of the workday. At all times I am carefully monitoring the patients I work with, looking for ways I can improve their understanding of what they are doing. I have found that through trying to develop personal connections, I am best able to earn my patient's trust, which in turn gives them confidence that their strenuous recovery regiments have a purpose. Through my efforts to administer the best care possible as a technician, I have been rewarded by witnessing those I help achieve their recovery goals. In my opinion, there is no better feeling in the world than being told: ‚Äúthank you‚Äù.  ",,,1,"Because of Covid-19, my plan to work as a therapy technician during the summer of 2020 had fallen through as only the therapists were allowed to return to the office; however, I did not allow this to discourage me. Immediately I began scouring the internet for volunteer opportunities in my area which was a struggle as most volunteer positions were shut down. However, through many internet searches, I eventually discovered Maybury Farm, an educational working farm. The farm work was all outside where I could safely distance myself from others. It was so rewarding to use my talents in woodworking and mechanics to ensure the animals at Maybury Farm were cared for. Additionally, I reached out to my former employer for volunteer work at Associated Orthopedists of Detroit, where I screened patients for Covid-19 prior to visiting with their doctor. I even found a way to contribute to my research lab from home by using online software to do data analysis and histology.",0,0,1

The devastation is engrained in my mind, with people begging for help. Wanting to be more proactive in the aftermath, I asked my aunt, a nurse at the local hospital, if I could volunteer. Stomach churning, my aunt stopped me at the entrance to Abbassia Fever Hospital. “This may be a lot to handle. Are you sure you want to do this?” I nodded.
The hospital’s sanitation made it challenging to work. The halls were dusted with sand, multiple patients were crowded into single rooms, and cats roamed the wards. In this resource-strapped environment, even I - as a volunteer - had a hand in patient care. One older woman had a severe case of bronchitis. She would have intense coughing fits that occasionally caused her to vomit, which I would clean up. But despite her ailments, she told me stories about her grandchildren and jewelry-making. We bonded over the meaning of different stones as I gave her medication and fed her meals. She was not only a patient but a businesswoman and a caregiver, and I wanted her to get back to the things she loved. When she was discharged, her excitement to return to her life was something that inspired me to keep going through those turbulent times. Through this experience, I found an outlet that allowed me to contribute to my community in a way I found gratifying - I can provide care to individuals through medicine and watch them slowly regain their health over time.
My drive to help others amidst adversity continued at home. Growing up Arab in a mostly White, conservative area an hour away from where 9/11 happened, I sometimes felt like I was living in a hostile environment. However, I received only a fraction of the discrimination that my grandparents faced, with their thick accents and limited assimilation with American culture. As a result, I became their liaison in this environment.
When my grandpa discovered he needed a pacemaker, he was reluctant to get the procedure. He had experiences with other professionals who dismissed his concerns as he struggled to articulate his thoughts in English. He feared this would happen with the doctor, but he reluctantly agreed to see a cardiologist, so long as I went with him. Sensing that my grandpa was apprehensive during the visit, the cardiologist kept a level-headed view and respected his concerns. The doctor carefully explained the procedure and allowed me to talk to my grandpa in Arabic to confirm his understanding. This professionalism and respect for someone initially hesitant about her practice showed how physicians must not only convey information but must also be willing to meet patients where they are. My grandpa’s decision to get the pacemaker was not based only on medical necessity but also on his concerns about discrimination that needed to be addressed for him to be comfortable receiving treatment. To this end, the cardiologist exhibited cultural sensitivity and served as a role model to me as my interest in a medical career grew. 
In college, I have continued to find ways to serve and advocate for others. I assisted students as a teaching assistant, became an active listener to guide people with mental health issues, and tutored children who were falling behind. These experiences taught me that success is rarely clear-cut or immediate. As much as I wanted a student to receive an A on their next exam or have a client come out of a session feeling perfectly good about their mental health, focusing on gradual improvement and setting long-term goals was more effective. With this in mind, success in these endeavors was not defined by a complete fix but by my ability to help people acquire skills to cope with and progress on their challenges. As I continue to expose myself to medicine through shadowing, I realize how similar lessons apply to the practice of medicine and how my service experiences prepare me for what it means to be a medical provider. Shadowing in the trauma operating room, I watched surgeons amputate a man’s leg. Shocked, I asked if something could be done to prevent this. Due to vascular injury, the doctors could not save his leg, but the focus was to try and amputate it below the knee, which would give him the best functional outcome given the circumstances. The patient would then need to start the long journey of recovery, rehabilitation, and training to live a full life as an amputee. I began seeing what it means to advocate for individuals in the face of medical complexity, where success is not based on cures or fixes but on guiding patients to make the most of their options.
My varied service experiences abroad, at home, and at school have taught me about empathy, especially toward those facing adversity. I hope to channel this perspective in medicine, in which I aim to help patients endure difficult situations and guide them forward. My background has prepared me to work with others, teaching me what it means to align on shared goals, even if they fall short of a cure. I find gratification in the process of healing others, as I experienced while volunteering in Egypt and advocating for my grandfather, and I am motivated to persevere in my endeavors today and in my future as a physician.","""What? It was normal. It's still normal,"" my grandmother said in response to my shock when she told me she had undergone female genital mutilation (FGM). I grew to believe that it was a harmful procedure and wanted to continue studying its negative impacts, from obstetric fistula to PTSD. However, when I began working with a professor, initially expecting to do the same work, she helped me step outside Western thought and explore FGM and its meaning to those who perform the practice. She detailed her work with women in the Democratic Republic of Congo, explaining that she realized some practices are more nuanced than they first seem. I have since shifted my perspective on the practice, now studying it with an understanding of its value to others, seeing how it was a rite of passage for women like my grandmother tried to explain to me. Through this experience, I learned that though a particular practice or ideal isn't normal to me, it is vital to recognize its significance to others.","My mother scoffed at the rainbow bracelet my brother was showing her and tersely told him to put it away. The excitement drained from his face. He had hoped to explore his femininity this year, but my mom's religiosity was at odds with this. Wanting to help him but knowing I could not change my mother's ideals overnight, I tried to shed light on other issues. I identified her recent episodes of short temper with my brother's mishaps. Bringing this to her attention helped her realize that she needed to be kinder. This led to her having more productive conversations with him instead of allowing anger to overpower her. Eventually, she began to see my brother's struggles from his side. Soon after, on a trip to the mall, she allowed him to purchase a pink shirt she had previously rejected. I learned that making small steps towards a greater goal makes achievements more manageable which parallels how many physicians work with colleagues and patients when treating illnesses.",,,1,"As my school transitioned to online learning, I first struggled to find the motivation to continue studying in this format. However, understanding how my classes might apply outside the classroom or after college, I still maintained the same work ethic as in-person by creating two separate spaces in my room - for work and rest. This maintained some normalcy. _x000D_

I injured both the medial and lateral ligamentous structures of my ankle—the words themselves did not mean much to me, but Dr. P’s tone conveyed what was at stake. Immediately undergoing surgical repair would have unceremoniously closed the book on my gymnastics career, but the orthopedics team recognized my passion and used their expertise to guide me through successful nonoperative management and an exciting year full of taping and bracing. I was impressed by the specialists’ knowledge and admired their ability to create a treatment plan that brought my goals to fruition. This experience ignited a personal interest in the field of medicine. I was curious to learn about a career in which I could play the role my doctors played for me—ensuring a patient can preserve their way of life even after calamity strikes.
In search of experiences that would cultivate this interest, one which occurred during my sophomore year of college gave me insight into the gravity of the doctor-patient relationship. As an intern in an orthopedics clinic, I met Ms. LD. After rooming her, I listened to her conversation with Dr. V. I watched her expressions ebb and flow with his body language. When he explained the diagnosis and potential surgical treatment, she heard his words, but listened to his delivery and reacted accordingly. After Dr. V explained the high likelihood of a successful outcome, I saw relief quickly shift to disappointment as she explained her hesitancy to opt for the operation. There was no way she could take a leave of absence from work for post-op recovery. Reflecting on my decision to continue competing despite my injuries, I could relate to this feeling of frustration. Perhaps the phrase that stuck with me most was, “It is ultimately up to you whether we operate, but if it were my mother in your position, I would encourage her to get surgery.” I was amazed by this statement because it revealed the constant interplay between physician and patient autonomy, and also how to maintain professionalism within the confines of the intimacy of the doctor-patient relationship. I noticed how Ms. LD was committed to following through with the nonoperative treatment plan because Dr. V adapted it to consider her concerns. Observing the results of this and many other patient-centered approaches to healthcare galvanized my desire to be a physician.
Following my exposure to medicine in the clinic, I was eager to align my academic preparation to fit my medical interests by studying kinesiology. My personal experiences as a gymnast and as a clinical intern placed the classroom content in vivid context. Learning about ankle injuries, I applied this new knowledge to examine my own rehabilitation journey. After the doctors in the clinic taught me about certain muscles, I could finally identify them on a cadaver. Exploring this intellectual interest reminded me of how my doctor explained the science of my situation. As a patient, it reinforced my trust in his ability and enabled me to make a more informed decision. I desire to be a physician who works diligently to help patients understand why a particular treatment is recommended or how their ailment occurred.
Outside of direct encounters with patients, I engaged with programs that gave me confidence in my feelings about my path to medicine. As a woman of color, it was transformative to be exposed to leaders in medicine who shared my demographic through the Daniel Hale Williams (DHW) Pre-Health Honor Society. One particular night after putting in grueling hours of organic chemistry homework, I went to a workshop where the medical students introduced patient interview and physical exam techniques. I felt at home on the clinician’s side of the patient encounter. As I walked back to my apartment that night, I had a renewed ambition to master pre-med classes, so that I would be well prepared for medical school. I was grateful this organization existed to provide such an experience to me, where I could discover my passion for medicine. More importantly, I was eager to lead the DHW community and develop content that exposed other students of color to the possibilities in healthcare careers. Realizing the influence I can have on future generations sparked an aspiration to use my platform to improve the landscape of race and gender in medicine, paving the way for others to follow.
Seeing encounters with patients like Ms. LD in the clinic highlighted the physician’s multifaceted roles of healer and advocate, as well as displayed the importance of the very same empathy that I felt during my bout with musculoskeletal issues. Meanwhile, through my studies and various DHW events, I saw yet another layer of the physician’s role in society at large as an educator and sponsor for change. I feel ready to take on the challenge of learning the science of medicine and translating that knowledge into skills that will allow me to take on these roles of a physician. Most of all, I am excited to exercise my expertise to provide hope to my future patients and stand alongside them in their journey to restoration.","I anticipated much of the conflict that living in Charlottesville after 2017 would bring. As an African American and Filipino American woman, I have always recognized the need to empathize with those unlike me because I always had to. I had no idea how transformative it would be to meet leaders in medicine who looked like me and who were also navigating majority culture spaces. _x000D_

I am grateful for the Daniel Hale Williams Pre-Health Honor Society (DHW) because it offered guidance and encouragement so that a woman of color could further explore her passion for medicine. I came to realize I too could inspire younger students in our community, whether a medical student or an attending physician. It revealed to me the overwhelming need for representation and cultural competence, and that an essential role of a physician is to be a sponsor for change. Therefore, I will use my platform at Rush and beyond to improve the landscape of race and gender in medicine.","DHW exposed me to the ways that medicine is improving and needs to continue to improve for minority populations. Serving my community has always been at the core of my values, from providing meals to the homeless with my church family to mentoring children in a project neighborhood. However, leading DHW was an opportunity to serve in a different way. Since the opportunities in DHW impacted me in so many ways, I was eager to develop content that would expose other students of color to the possibilities in healthcare careers._x000D_

Even more important than the guest speakers and programs, our team fostered a supportive and influential community. I saw this through the success of a big sibling program, and especially as I personally mentored underclassmen.

My hope is that I can inspire the next generation just as much as the previous one has done for me. ",,,1,"There were two challenges that impacted my journey to medical school during the pandemic.

Dr. Adamson offered her sincere condolences for the news and explained how the CT Abdomen showed multiple localized tumors on the liver. As I saw the tears roll down the patient's wife's face, I became heartbroken and could not bear to imagine what it was like to hear that news. Dr. Adamson proceeded to say, ""I know this must be difficult for both of you to hear."" I recognized that she allowed the patient time to digest the tragic news and gave him space to express his fear, frustration, and concerns. Through positive affirmations, she validated the patient's feelings through reiteration while addressing every concern. She explained the possible treatment options with detailed descriptions for each plan, allowing for informed autonomy. With both Dr. Adamson and I being aware of the waiting room filling up, she proceeded to stay with the patient to enable him and his wife room to express their thoughts for another 20 minutes. I was amazed to see someone handle a situation so well, holding the patient's well-being above all. It was the first time I realized that being a physician is not only about understanding human physiology but is also equally about the communication and care you give to your patients. The conversation was transformative as I understood the value of being a patient advocate and defined why I wanted to go into medicine. As we left the room, I even saw the patient smile. 

This experience has inspired me to pursue advocating for those that need support. I elected to volunteer at the Health Resource Center and worked as a stand-in social worker, offering resources to the discharged patients and providing support through their toughest battles. Working in the clinic allowed me to step into the role of the ""explainer,"" which I loved. I directed and informed patients regarding available resources for their specific socioeconomic needs, such as applying for insurance to contacting food banks. As I sat with these individuals of differing socioeconomic backgrounds and learned about their stories, I recognized the disparities these patients face in medicine. It is to patients like these that physicians must ensure to help guide them from a place of suffering to receiving the right resources that benefit their well-being. When providing information and answering questions, I began to understand the difficulties that many health care professionals face with language barriers. The most memorable conversations I've had were with the children that had foreign parents who could not speak about their conditions and problems fluently in English. I often had flashbacks to my childhood when I questioned why my mother could not go alone to her primary care appointments. After talking indirectly to numerous patients through their children, I realized that my mom needed me then, recalling times when I had to explain the physician's emphasis on obtaining Pap smears or HPV screenings. These experiences have inspired me to strive to become a physician that can understand these challenges and be a strong patient advocate by providing clear medical communication to individuals like my mother. 

I am still developing my skills as an ""explainer."" While tutoring elementary students in science and reading comprehension, the step-by-step process has helped me develop my communication skills by learning to explain concepts patiently. I cannot compare the satisfaction of taking a struggling student to the ""aha, I got it"" moment. Although on a smaller scale, I believe this is why I am drawn to children who are full of life and enjoy seeing their journey to becoming independent adults. Further on, my experiences with a pediatric ENT have affirmed my passion for pursuing pediatrics through seeing the fun interactions the physician has with the patients during the physical examination. I recognized the importance of creating a relaxed environment for the patient by watching the physician's ability to take a tempered toddler into a calm, giggling patient by talking about ""looking at their boogers"" with an otoscope. I saw first-hand how the physician prioritized educating both the parents and the children, helping explain the plan of care that is understandable for all. I recognized the physicians' teaching role with patients, medical students, residents, and colleagues in the medical field. I aspire to become a resource for children with whom they can come to have difficult conversations, ask questions they are too afraid to ask their parents, and create a positive and safe environment.

I want to become a physician to provide effective care to my patients through developing these meaningful connections and caring for their mental, social, and physical health. Being a doctor means being an advocate, a communicator, and going the extra mile to ensure that patients are cared for and have their questions answered. To take the time to explain a confusing or difficult diagnosis. To be a physician that listens to their patients' needs. To be a person that understands that medicine is a conversation.","While working at Saint Louis University's Health Resource Center, I helped provide various resources to patients from differing socioeconomic backgrounds at the free healthcare clinic. I was an individual who could actively listen to their problems resulting from disparities such as financial issues and food scarcity._x000D_
 _x000D_
This experience was the first time I played a part in assisting someone's well-being in a medical environment. I have seen countless patients who constantly say that they would not have sought care if the free clinic was not available. It unsettles me about the individuals with treatable conditions that cannot receive the proper care. _x000D_
_x000D_
I recognized my love for creating meaningful patient interactions and the importance of preventative medicine by advocating for the patient's social circumstances and health. I understand the importance of primary care in underserved communities, as these workers help support individuals facing problematic health disparities.","After the free health clinic, we ask patients to complete a survey. The form has 12 questions asking for information such as the need for insurance or financial aid. When I discuss with the patient at discharge, I always ask the questions again to ensure they did not accidentally mark ""no"" for a question that I was able to provide resources for. I asked about her housing situation, as she circled, ""no."" She explained that she must have misread the question as she currently has an unstable housing situation due to her financial problems. _x000D_
 _x000D_
I looked through the database of available resources and found an organization that provides rent assistance and individual case management. I explained to her how to best contact the organization and with a prepared list of questions to best discuss her situation. She thanked me for the help and explained that she had limited access to the internet to be able to find these resources. I was proud of the support the clinic provides for the community. ",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic created difficulties for me to shadow physicians in the hospital throughout the first two years of my college career. Many hospitals near Saint Louis University (SLU) did not allow undergraduate students to shadow; overall, limiting my desire to understand the different specialties in the beginning years of university. With SLU hospital re-opening to undergraduate students in Fall 2021, I visited nine different specialties for a combined 106 hours throughout my junior year of college._x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, the pandemic created challenges in developing strong relationships with all my professors. With SLU transitioning to a mixture of in-person/online courses, it was hard to form professional connections. However, even with this disruption, I still made efforts to attend office hours and stay after class on Zoom to interact with my professors by asking questions and further opportunities to apply myself.",1,0,2

I arced my racket high into the sky and struck the tennis ball hard over the net, serving the ball to my opponent, who quickly launched the ball back at me. I positioned myself for another swing. As I pushed off my left foot, I experienced immediate shooting pain in my left knee. I was diagnosed with a meniscus tear. Sports were how I connected with my friends in high school, and I was devastated. After the surgical repair of my meniscus, I underwent six grueling months of rehabilitation, and my physician's comforting presence played an enormous factor in my healing. The simple, genuine humaneness in his eye contact, smile, and explanations regarding my care cemented my trust in him. His quiet confidence alleviated my fears, and I felt euphoric on the day I laced up my shoes and walked back onto the tennis court. My physician's positive impact on my journey to recovery left me inspired. I became enthralled with the idea of becoming a doctor to similarly heal and comfort future patients with whom I come into contact.
My desire to become a physician was further reinforced during high school. After a cow eyeball dissection, I became interested in anatomy. I recall dissecting the eyeball, astonished at the intricacy of the eye. I was amazed at the layering of the structures in the eye that allows us to see. I was further inspired when I collected 500 used eyeglasses from local optical shops to donate to Aravind Eye Hospital in Coimbatore, India. I witnessed the joy that patients experienced when the glasses helped them see the letters during their vision exam. Seeing used eyeglasses impact patients, I was further motivated by the notion of improving patient quality of life as a future physician.  
My journey and fascination with medicine continued during my undergraduate education. I started working as an ophthalmic technician and scribe at a retina clinic. After I shared my interest in becoming a physician, one of the retina specialists in the clinic allowed me to examine his eye. I secured the headgear, and he adjusted the lens to his eye. Suddenly, his bright orange retina flashed in my field of view. I was astonished to see the anatomy of the eye in such detail. My desire to continue on this path was strengthened after observing his live retina. I also learned about the role of physicians as investigators and the importance of medical documentation. I was fascinated that every piece of health information that I gathered could be used by the physician in arriving at the diagnosis and treatment. 
In my role as an ophthalmic technician, I had a distinct encounter with a mother and her premature baby that impacted the way I hope to interact with future patients. When the mother walked into the office, she greeted me with a smile, but I could sense that she was nervous. I was worried as well but knew I had to remain confident. As I lifted the baby's eyelid to instill the eye drops, the baby began to cry. The mother yelled, ""Be gentle."" Her admonishment startled me, and I retreated my hands. I quickly apologized and handed her a glove, asking if she would like to hold the baby's eyelid. She finally made eye contact with me, and I could tell that involving her in the process caused her to relax. Initially, our interaction was uncomfortable. However, as I modeled the compassion and comfort my orthopedic surgeon showed me when I was a patient, we began to build a rapport. Often, patients are in vulnerable states due to a myriad of reasons. Therefore, I must be prepared to modify my approach and techniques to comfort my future patients. I aspire to always think of my patients and their needs first as I help them navigate their medical journey.
As my interest in medicine grew, I joined two research projects analyzing fundus photos for hemorrhages or yellow pigments in the retina. We were looking to determine if these signs were a side effect of patients taking anticoagulants or medications for interstitial cystitis. I was drawn to this project because I have permanent tinnitus as a side effect of an over-the-counter medication. Through both experiences, I further learned about the connectedness of the body's systems. Medications used to treat one part of the body could negatively affect another part of the body. One of my goals in medicine is to continue the work physicians have achieved in informed decision-making. I want to emphasize education on the benefits and consequences of treatments to give patients the knowledge to make decisions about their health. 
Ultimately, being a patient with a knee injury revealed my desire to become a physician. As I explored my curiosities for medicine, it confirmed my purpose. The physician who healed me became the model that I want to exemplify. As I pursue a life as a physician, I will do my best to comfort patients through compassion and confidence to build rapport. My goal is to build trust in these interactions to earn the privilege of helping them. I am determined to endure the rigors to gain the skills and knowledge to positively impact my future patients. I am prepared to commit myself to evolve into a provider who treats patients holistically and puts the patients' needs first.","My interactions with the native Spanish speakers while volunteering for Mission Cataract were the most eye-opening. I took Spanish classes in 2015, but I was not confident in my communication skills. I could guide these patients in the clinic, but those adept at Spanish communicated with them. Thus, I was motivated to continue learning Spanish. Since 2017, I could have basic conversations, and I witnessed how conversing in their native language made them appear more comfortable. From my experiences at the clinic, I witnessed how language barriers in health care can directly impact patient comfort and affect their willingness to discuss their conditions with the medical staff. Thus, I desire to be a future physician who can connect with patients and staff. Furthermore, I want to foster an environment where cultural differences do not affect health outcomes. To promote health equity in a nation as diverse as ours, I must understand the needs of the diverse patients I will encounter. _x000D_
","During the pandemic, I witnessed the potential of community outreach. I helped with a vaccination drive, made 200 masks, and performed temperature checks. I worked with the priests and other volunteers to ensure county guidelines were followed to reduce the spread of COVID. Furthermore, when spreading awareness of the vaccination drive, we learned about the fears regarding the vaccine. Some members expressed they felt more comfortable receiving a vaccine in a familiar setting and where the workers spoke their native language. As a result, they urged their friends and family to follow suit. In the process, I realized how powerful community partnerships could be in promoting public health. These comprehensive healthcare partnerships can be tailored to the communities' health, social, and cultural needs, leading to better health outcomes. I see myself as a physician using my knowledge from these experiences to develop joint partnerships to alleviate disparities in healthcare. _x000D_

When one of my siblings would crash their bike, I would be so excited—because I got to clean their wounds and put band aids on for them. After ""ambulance girl"" I had a dozen different ideas about who I could become—rockstar, pilot, teacher (and I do still love teaching)—but what I knew at a young age was that I never wanted to be my brother. Retrospectively, that’s pretty unfair. Chris was kind, he was patient with his much younger siblings, and he helped the people around him. But in adolescence, he also became addicted to drugs. As an adult, rather than a 7 year old, I now know addiction is not a choice. Chris was struggling, in ways that many young people struggle. With neurodivergence, with mental health, with just trying to fit in.

Much of my work and volunteer experience has been centered around helping children and adolescents. I’ve worked at several preschools, helping to guide children through some of their most formative years, and at first it was overwhelming. Conflict and injury prevention is preferable, but not always attainable when juggling so many different kids. In one instance, I was across the room when I saw Zachy punch his sister Vanessa. It’d be easy to walk over and say, “Hitting is bad, Zachy, you can’t play with the blocks anymore.” What took more time and patience, but in the end was much more effective, was to communicate that what Zachy did was wrong in a way that he understood, so hopefully he wouldn’t do it again. It was an opportunity for me to teach empathy and accountability to both kids, and to further their social and emotional development. Moreover, my communication skills later translated to my work as a tutor, learning assistant, and TA, when teaching biology and anatomy, and improved my ability to gauge my students’ understanding.

On UC Davis Medical Center’s pediatric floor I was also involved in helping children process emotions, and hopefully distract them from everything they were going through. I would spend my time there ensuring the cleanliness and safety of the playroom and communicating with Child Life staff and the nursing team about how I could best assist them. Some of my favorite moments, though, were going bedside with kids. My most rewarding experience here was going bedside with a middle school girl, whom I spent around an hour chatting with while her dad was out. She told me all about her taekwondo classes, her diagnosis, and her crush, then she wanted to hear some of my embarrassing stories. Several weeks later, I was sitting in the playroom doing art therapy with a little girl, when the same middle schooler spotted me from the hallway. Her face lit up and she waved. Not 5 minutes later, she walked into the playroom, her mom in tow, saying she wanted to introduce us. I’d already been volunteering at UCDMC for 2 quarters at this point, but when I reflect on my time there, it was that moment when I knew my presence was truly making a difference. I chose to embark on this internship so I could experience how a pediatric floor was run, and also so I could determine how well I was able to handle working with sick and injured kids. While it was difficult knowing that not every patient that I interacted with was going to recover, that middle school girl reaffirmed that pediatrics was a path that I could undoubtedly pursue.

My course work in human rights helped me as a CNA as I worked with the elderly in a skilled nursing and post-acute facility, specifically relating to the rights of the elderly and the ethics of care. Young people and the elderly both crave independence, but also require patience and, honestly, the ability to disguise feelings of exasperation. There were patients with dementia who had to be told the same information every 5 minutes. Others experienced sundowning, and could get very aggravated, or even aggressive in the afternoons. If a patient like that was upset and swearing at staff, I had to be able to not take it personally. It’s not that I did something wrong necessarily, but that they were tired, confused, and frustrated. It was still my job to help them to the best of my ability, which was much easier when I remained calm and friendly. I found that, similar to kids, patients suffering from dementia were very discerning when it came to tone and facial expressions. As one of my patients remarked, I had a “calming presence,” that I learned to utilize to help defuse potentially volatile situations.

At the core of every extracurricular experience I had, I realized that most people just want someone to listen and to care about what they are going through, which is possible to do while still getting every other task done. Whether they’re 3 years old or 93 years old, allowing people to talk about their struggles free of judgment, to just be someone who cares and wants to ease their suffering, can make all the difference. This, combined with my interest in disease, my fascination with anatomy, and my passion for teaching, have led me to believe that medicine is the route through which I can heal and alleviate pain. I can utilize the patience and compassion my brother showed others to help young people struggling like he did.","During May of 2020, near the onset of the pandemic, I helped found a nonprofit to advocate for social justice and ethnic studies at a time when communities of color were protesting ongoing violence and vitriol. Inspired by learning about and meeting activists of the Civil Rights Movement, the goal of Reform Revolution Project was to be a social media based resource amplifying the voices of POC. My work with RRP was a means of supporting the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ friends that I had made, while also educating myself and others on critical topics. I did extensive reading on ethnic studies and racial justice in order to further understand the circumstances this country was (and still is) facing, to spread accurate and thorough information, and to better advise my mentees. I grew up poor, but in other ways I am very privileged. I believe that I have the obligation to use my privilege to destroy systems of oppression. The better informed I am, the better I am able to connect with my patients.","When working as a CNA, there were several patients that I assisted who had dementia. Two of these residents in particular could be challenging at times. The first experienced sundowning, and could become extremely aggravated, or even aggressive, in the afternoons. The second patient had early onset dementia, but because she was still relatively young, she easily became restless and bored. Oftentimes she would forget to press her call light, and just begin yelling for assistance. It was easy to become annoyed on certain days, for myself and the other staff, but I always worked to conceal it from these residents, as they may sense it and become agitated as well. I gave my patients- and coworkers- grace; if they were overwhelmed I would step in to assist the patient instead. It gave other CNAs a chance to regroup and patients the space to calm down. Treating the residents, and my coworkers as well, with patience and kindness created a less stressful, happier environment for everyone.",,,1,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of my plans post college have been delayed, if not put on indefinite hold. Travel plans changed, but more importantly, the experiences I had in the medical field were altered. I was unable to finish my last shift as a Child Life Volunteer in March of 2020. Additionally, my plans to enroll in another Global Medical Training expedition could no longer happen.  However, I was also given the opportunity for other experiences that I otherwise would have been unable to achieve. I started a social justice non-profit, took CNA courses, and was active in the medical field during a pandemic. I try to make the best of whatever situation I find myself in, so even though I am applying a year after I had originally intended, I am glad for the new and unique experiences I was able to have.",1,0,3

I dipped in and out of consciousness in the ambulance, jolting awake at the occasional bump until I was left gazing at the white ceiling of a hospital room, feeling alone. At ten years old, I was overwhelmed by the unfamiliar medical jargon that filled the room as providers entered. Confusion and fear eclipsed any physical pain from the gaping wound. Then, a physician held my small hands. When I looked into her eyes, I felt her genuine concern and compassion. As someone who prefers understanding, I finally let out a sigh of relief when she explained how she would numb and stitch my ankle, and that I would be perfectly fine. Although I will never forget the distress and uncertainty, I will always hold onto the feeling of solace the physician provided. I knew then that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine, offering this sense of comfort to others. Specifically, I wanted to emulate this physician's practice of applying expertise to provide individual-centered guidance and care.
It was this desire that led me to volunteer with Pipeline, an organization that provides mentorship and support to West Philadelphia high school students. One day, in an effort to promote the COVID-19 vaccine, I explained how it functioned to my five students. To my dismay, I was met with blank faces on my Zoom screen. I asked the class if they planned on getting vaccinated, in hopes of increasing engagement. 
“No.”
Surprised, I blurted, “What? Why?” Given the statistics that showed how the pandemic had disproportionately ravaged West Philadelphia, I struggled to understand their hesitance. With a shrug, one student replied, “I dunno. I guess I don’t wanna be a guinea pig.”
I was confronted by the reality that communities, perhaps including these very students, have vastly different relationships with physicians and medicine as an institution. For many, the healthcare system does not represent the beacon of hope that it has been for me. All the facts about mRNA couldn’t change that.
To address this difference, I asked my students to share their concerns about the vaccine with me privately, if they felt comfortable. With a better understanding of their fears, I presented facts and statistics, emphasizing the ones that directly addressed these doubts. After my final slide, I again asked if they planned on getting vaccinated. Bright yellow emoticons popped up on my screen. Four of my students “raised” their hands.
This experience reaffirmed my desire to be a physician. Connecting with my students, clarifying any uncertainty or misinformation that led to distrust, and supporting them as they took ownership of their health was incredibly fulfilling. It was also motivating; having built a more nuanced understanding of the inequalities marginalized communities face through the heartfelt experiences shared by my students, I wanted to play a larger role in addressing this disparity.
I soon found an opportunity by volunteering with SHOP, a community health outreach program. To make myself a familiar face, I began conducting blood pressure screenings for underserved residents at a homeless shelter.
Weeks flew by, and I soon recognized and regularly interacted with some of the residents. One chilly night, an overdressed man shuffled in. He was one of the regulars who typically avoided having his blood pressure taken. However, this time, he slowed down as he walked by the table.
“Would you like a blood pressure test?”
Hesitantly, he nodded. I proceeded to take his blood pressure. 140/105. “That’s bad right?” he mumbled. As I removed the cuff from his trembling arm, I saw him anxiously staring at the monitor. He continued, “I know it’s bad. I don’t know why. What do I do?”
I first commended him for taking such a significant step. By bravely allowing me to take his blood pressure, he established a baseline for a partnership where we could clarify his confusion and navigate his fears. Then, I calmly explained the difference between the two numbers. I described how each heartbeat pumps blood throughout the body, exerting pressure on the vessels, and how if this pressure is too high, the vessels can become damaged. He nodded along, occasionally interjecting, until he exhausted all of his questions. Through this experience, I felt how invigorating it was to guide someone who was lost, to help them directly address their angst. Yet, I was unsatisfied with my inability to answer all of his questions or to offer a path of actionable steps forward. Momentary comfort wasn’t enough; I wished to treat him through his whole journey in managing his condition.
As a physician, I will strive to be a source of comfort and knowledge for my patients. In the past few years, I have recognized that a key component to achieving my goal is connecting with the community I hope to serve and understanding their unique concerns. Throughout college, I have seized as many opportunities as possible to learn how to address social disparities in medicine and build skills to provide compassionate care. Studying medicine will allow me to take the next step in joining a community of providers dedicated to enacting long-standing change and solutions.","To avoid COVID, I quit my job at McDonald‚Äôs. However, this luxury was not an option for others like my co-worker Alma. She had to keep working to support her two children and had unknowingly contracted COVID.

_x000D_
Her statement demonstrated a recurring issue within our society: negative assumptions. Since I knew about her family and financial situation, I understood her inability to isolate herself during the pandemic. However, someone unfamiliar with the case would instantly frown upon hearing that she didn‚Äôt adhere to the initial quarantine. This experience showed me the importance of remaining unbiased, especially when it came to strangers. Without an open mind, one wouldn‚Äôt be able to connect with a patient to the level critical for providing well-rounded care.","One day, while volunteering at a homeless shelter, an older man came over to get a blood pressure screening.

Every Saturday I stood at the doors of the entrance of the hospital– a dull and mundane routine. I repeated the same information to every incomer: “up the stairs and to the left” for the cafeteria and “down the hall and two right turns” for the emergency room. One morning, during a Chicago snowstorm, I noticed a woman, Magdalena, shivering in the blizzard as she neared the front steps. Visibly frostbitten, I approached her and asked if I could escort her to the emergency room. She whispered, “I’m okay, thank you” in a thick Polish accent I immediately recognized. Appearing distrustful of hospitals, I spoke to her in our shared mother language, explaining that I wasn’t a doctor, but I could help her receive medical care, and I assured her the staff would take good care of her. The wrinkles in her smile framed her frightened blue eyes as she whispered, “Dziekuje” (thank you); I wrapped my coat around her to bring her inside. I went home feeling grateful I could intimately connect with and comfort a patient with the Polish-speaking skills I rarely found useful in my predominantly English-speaking hometown.

With a Polish mother and a Haitian father, I’m the epitome of the culture blending of American immigrant families. As I began college, I was enthralled with the opportunity to apply my appreciation towards diverse communities and cultures. Chicago, like the rest of the U.S., encompasses a beautiful mixture of races, languages, and cultures, but it’s easy to lose sight of the importance of these differences when delivering personalized care to such communities. Thus, I began assisting Chicago’s minority Polish communities – specifically elderly immigrants with little American assimilation – by providing translation and medical interpreting services for these patients before eventually acquiring bilingual proficiency in Polish medical terminology. I strived to play a role in giving underserved communities access to healthcare by breaking the language barrier between patients and physicians. By doing so, I recognized its importance in delivering personalized care in medicine. Beyond the ability to translate Polish medical terms, I endeavored to discern the different cultures I interacted with by also improving my Spanish and becoming conversational in Russian.The multicultural environment I offered to patients made it easier for them to address personal circumstances that would have otherwise been difficult to interpret and openly talk about. I appreciated how establishing meaningful social connections with patients and their cultures could mean the difference between making potentially life-saving decisions.

Building on my clinical experience and strong communal ties, I applied my scientific knowledge from the classroom to my medical pursuits. As a neuroscience major, I wanted to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the health determinants of cerebrovascular disease, as such factors were exacerbated in the underserved communities I had been interacting with. Alongside my mentor, neurologist Dr. James Brorson, I combined my interests in neuroscience, statistics, and health disparities into developing a clinical predictive model to identify patients at risk for a secondary attack after an initial stroke; our goal was to develop a prevention monitoring strategy for clinicians and patients. I immersed myself in the study design aspects of research and published my first successful manuscript. Beyond data analysis, this research exposed me to precision health medicine. The ability to analyze individual patient data, and then apply statistics into medicine to produce a predictive model, was appealing to me given the broader aims of our research. I was fascinated we could swiftly calculate one’s risk for a clinical outcome based on individual baseline factors using our model. I saw myself at the forefront of precision medicine, wanting to further this by applying what I had learned into disease prevention, early diagnosis, and closing the gap in health disparities in ways I had imagined when translating to my fellow immigrant Polish community. With such goals, I will foster this passion in the Masters of Science in Precision Health at the University of Chicago this fall.

Through my experiences, I have begun to understand the complexity of what it takes to become a physician, and I will channel this into delivering personalized medicine with outsized impacts on patient healthcare to a wider population. Beyond healing, physicians must integrate the aspects of applying interpersonal skills, which includes making social change by community outreach to bridge health disparities, and by constantly evolving the field of medicine through focused prevention and care. I seek to empower underserved communities and expand my skills as an advocate, leader, scientist, and multilingual doctor. With a combination of these attributes, I hope to heal others who are unable to advocate for themselves, implement my future research into precision medicine, and be at the forefront of bridging health disparities. This way, the next time I cross a patient like Magdalena, I will be the one saving her life.","As a former US Rhythmic Gymnastics National Team member, I‚Äôve developed an appreciation for the diverse peoples that embody our world. At my first World Championships, I encountered an Angolan athlete, noticing a serious injury. Because her team lacked medical staff, I called over our team‚Äôs doctor to assist her‚Äì she welled up with tears at the aid we gave her, because her country could barely afford even attending the competition. The next day, she brought us a container of Muamba de Galinha, a traditional Angolan dish. We shared this meal, reflecting on the similarities and differences with my Haitian background and hers. Though we came to the competition under different circumstances, I realized that no matter what country, race, or socioeconomic status we belong to, we are all united under the necessity for medical care. I hope to foster such meaningful interactions in every patient I encounter as a student at Rush, catering to patients of all walks of life. ","With a Polish mother and Haitian father, I have always been fond of the cultural diversity of Chicago. Part of my excitement with starting college was the opportunity to apply my appreciation for such communities surrounding my school, especially in the South Side of Chicago. Like the rest of the US, Chicago has a beautiful mixture of races, languages, and cultures, but it‚Äôs easy for these differences to be unacknowledged in personalized care. I connected with minority communities by providing translation services for Polish elderly immigrants‚Äì I wanted to mediate interactions between patients and physicians with a language barrier. I felt I advocated for these patients‚Äô needs better, as a common language made addressing personal circumstances easier. My contribution was minor, but I valued being a part of change for the quality of care for those of my heritage. By learning more languages like Russian and Spanish, I hope to be able to offer this to even more patients in Chicago.",,,1,"Adjusting to COVID-19 proved to be challenging from the start. I felt overwhelmed with my Organic Chemistry course while moving remotely. Working in healthcare became a burden on my parents during my final exams; after catching the virus, I didn‚Äôt complete the course to the best of my abilities. However, I made up for my lack of Organic Chemistry knowledge, earning high marks in Biochemistry. After struggling, I wanted to strengthen remote learning at UChicago, so I became a part of the Exploratory Teaching Group. Here, I worked for a project with professors from my premedical courses to alleviate obstacles in learning throughout the pandemic. Analyzing data from surveys I created, I led focus groups to guide direct feedback for professors. Mentoring enabled me to advocate for students‚Äô honest criticism in regard to their courses‚Äì I was able to turn something I struggled with into a positive experience for my peers.",1,0,2

I have two moms and a twin sister who are all LGBTQ-identifying. Living in an extremely traditional community, I was very much aware that our family was different. In elementary and middle school, my sister and I were the only students with same-sex parents, creating a sense of openness to those around me. My sister's struggle with ADHD and anxiety throughout her life has also added to my sensitivity, both emotionally and situationally. My scientific mind goes to a place where I dive deeper into genetics as I have watched her experience many setbacks; my calm, reflective demeanor and laser focus could not be more opposite, yet we share similar DNA. Luckily, my parents were able to provide my sister with the resources needed to thrive, and that has made all the difference. When I watch other students struggle, I often volunteer my time to help, understanding how anxiety and loss of confidence can derail a person. My parents have also been great role models in the areas of service, hard work, and humor. It was through the lens of a healthcare administrator and an educator that I gained an appreciation for giving back and practicing kindness every day.

Before I knew what resume building was, I had been consistently following a path of service, mentoring, and healthcare. One experience that was instrumental in my decision to pursue a career as a physician was my work as an EMT at 16 years old. Being exposed in real-time to the fragility of life added to my compassion and curiosity. After extensive training and practice, my skills were not enough to save one of my patients. Why did the CPR not work?  Why did the science behind my treatment fail? I went down the rabbit hole; researching what went wrong, asking what I could have done differently. Thankfully, I had a mentor who helped me work through this and assured me that I could not have done anything differently. Overcoming this reality would take time, but I refused to quit, continuing to hone my skills and gain experience.

Another example that reflects both my sensitivity and ability to problem solve under pressure involves a marble and an elementary school student. Unable to contact the parents, the school nurse asked that he be taken by the ambulance to the ER for an X-ray. Comforting the sobbing kindergarten student came very naturally as I told him about the time when I had snacked on Legos and had to have pictures taken of my stomach as well. Ironically, I treated this situation with the same level of focus and passion that I did when administering CPR to my dying patient a few weeks before. Being able to access my toolbox of skills across different situations has built my confidence as a clinician. I would continue to refine these skills in my clinical work as a scribe and MA at CityMD Urgent Care, during the height of COVID.

The pandemic looming, I closely followed the research in creating the vaccine but had minimal lab experience at the time. The opportunities presented to me at Tufts would change that, allowing me to take my curiosity, initiative, and leadership to another level. Forming JEZA Genomics with two classmates, we designed a treatment to combat cancers associated with BRCA1 mutations. This was my first stepping stone in synthesizing and practicing translational science in medicine. Similarly, my summer work at Hibercell exposed me to lab research used in clinical trials and the process of bringing cancer treatment to market. Having been an advocate for patients as a first responder and then working behind the scenes in the lab, I was able to participate in and appreciate the full circle of care.

Reflecting on all of the experiences and people who have led me here today, I am reminded of where I started. The roots, support, and opportunities created in my home gave me the foundation and confidence to question and explore the world around me. By taking advantage of these opportunities, I was able to follow a path that serves both myself and others very well. When I think about what kind of physician I will be or why I should be given the chance to attend medical school, I leave you with the following: I have progressed from a curious student to a clinician and researcher. My dedication to this journey can be seen in every class that I have taken, every patient that I have treated, and every situation where I have pushed myself to be the best person that I can be. My compassion, work ethic, flexibility, and pure joy that I find in my work are what sets me apart. My only regret during this process has been my performance on the MCAT, which I unknowingly took while battling COVID. This score did not reflect my practice test performance scores and I kindly request that you take this into consideration when assessing my application. I guarantee that taking a chance on me will not be a gamble and that the physician that I will become will reflect positively on the school that I represent.","Growing up in an all-female household with same-sex parents has instilled in me an openness to the world from a young age. I grew up learning never to make assumptions or pass judgments on others. This is a gift that I have carried throughout my life and have applied in many different environments. As a Tufts FOCUS Leader, I guided Tufts first-years in urban community work throughout Boston. I was charged with creating a safe environment for my team, but also for those we served. In providing tutoring, environmental cleanup, and mentoring efforts, not only did my diverse perspective contribute to the success of our work but also allowed me to connect with my peers from diverse backgrounds. This sensitivity to the needs of others that I have acquired through both my home life, years of global service work, and position as an EMT has been instrumental in my personal growth. As a future physician, relying on this open-mindedness will help me serve my patients more compassionately.","Working on the front lines during COVID as a first responder and scribe at CityMD proved to be my most challenging work in health care. It is here where I feel that I made the most impact on the surrounding community, as we served as a safe place for everyone. I have never been part of an organization that worked so tirelessly and selflessly as my colleagues at CityMD. The teamwork and unity that we modeled for the panic-stricken patients of underserved communities were calming and reassuring to many families. Kindness, kindness, and more kindness were our daily motto as we strove to get through 14-hour shifts while serving over 200 patients per day. This was one of my proudest moments in giving back to my community and one that I hope to continue as a student at Rush, as becoming a primary care physician in an urban setting is my goal.",,,1,"I am very proud of the application that I have put together for Rush. I take much pride in the work that has gone into my academic, professional, volunteer, and research successes. From my training as a clinician to my many roles as a mentor on campus, I bring unparalleled energy, commitment, and care to my work. The only discrepancy on my application would be my MCAT score. Unknowingly taking the exam while having COVID, my performance reflected my health at the time. I can only say that my practice test scores - 510 and 511 - which I am happy to submit, are more in line with my capabilities and your standards. My confidence in my future as a medical school student remains unwavering, yet to an admissions committee, I understand the concerns. I would greatly appreciate you taking the above information into serious consideration when deciding on my candidacy.

The crowd’s cheers were muffled by my rhythmic breathing and the sound of my metal spikes piercing the rubber surface below me. As I crossed the finish line, I burst into tears— not of happiness, but of sorrow. That was the last race I would run before enduring a year of pain and physical therapy. My orthopedic surgeon had assured me that running the rest of the season would not further damage my bilateral labral tears. Yet the pain of pushing through my injury was insignificant compared to the heartache of stepping away from my sport and from my team. Nevertheless, I underwent successive labral repair surgeries that summer, abruptly switching from an active life on the track to what seemed like an eternity on the couch. 

The next year, I worked tirelessly to regain my strength and the ability to run. Through hours of physical therapy and countless doctor appointments, I began to rethink my relationship with track and field. A year earlier, running had been my passion, something I felt I could never live without. However, after interacting with the medical system as a patient, I gained a deeper appreciation for the privilege that comes with being able-bodied. With this humbled perspective, I have a new appreciation not only for athletics, but also the medical professionals who guard our physical abilities.

My personal introduction to medicine fueled my fascination with the human body and its capacity to heal. When my orthopedist walked through the clinic door during my last appointment, he was already grinning ear to ear, awaiting the in-depth questions I brought to each visit. This same boundless curiosity enveloped me at track practice where I stood on the sideline querying my coach, who was also my physics teacher, about the most effective quadriceps-calf angles to maximize power. Once I returned to running, it was no longer simply a mode of competition, but rather a means of exercising my curiosity. 

When I started college at UVA, I rushed to the library to scour the literature on orthopedics. I enrolled in Kinesiology and became a participant in several research studies in the physical therapy department. My second year at UVA, I reached out to Dr. Abhijit Dighe, the Research Coordinator in the Cui Lab of Orthopedics. Dr. Dighe became my mentor, encouraging me to harness my curiosity through cell culture, animal handling, and surgical procedures. Other researchers trusted me with difficult dissections and provided me with opportunities to grow as an undergraduate researcher. As a member of the Cui Lab, I was grateful to be able to contribute to a growing body of research while channeling my curiosity.

I learned so much from my patient and research experiences in orthopedics, but ultimately felt something was missing. Eager to gain a different perspective in medicine, I applied to the Scribe program in the UVA Emergency Department. I immediately fell in love with the intersection of my orthopedic interests and other evidence-based practices. I also wanted to gain exposure to the multitude of disciplines within the medical field. It was through these daily encounters with patients with varied maladies that I became steadfast in my determination to practice clinical medicine. After just a few shifts, I petitioned the administration to allow me to work above the 20-hour per week limit, eager to return to the ED soon after leaving each shift. 

I can still recall the first trauma I encountered in the ED. My ears buzzed with voices surrounding the workroom as medical personnel swarmed the hallway, echoing “MVC with rollover, extremity amputation.” Glued to the corner of the bay, writing frivolously with a notepad in hand, my mouth hung open behind my mask. The orthopedic team strode into the bay with a commanding presence, toting the severed extremity in an Igloo cooler. They orchestrated the entire encounter with a sense of composed urgency, reassuring the patient that she was in good hands. At that moment, I realized that surgeons have the rare ability to reassure people during their worst circumstances by providing them with concrete solutions. I yearned to one day be in that position, able to assuage someone’s fears with the confidence that I have the skills to truly care for them.

As a scribe, I feel honored to contribute to the patient care team and to have taken part in each patient’s medical narrative. Now when I return home from a long shift in the ED, I set down my scrubs and pick up my running shoes. But while I may be able to lace up and enjoy the rest of a sunny day after coming home from the Emergency Department, most of the patients I see cannot. These afternoon runs have become a sacred space for reflection in my life. Not only do I express gratitude for my own recovery from injury, but I also think of those I helped care for in the ED. Looking back, my injury opened the door to my interest in medicine and allowed me to balance pain and resilience. With each of these runs, I condition both my body and my mind, and feel more prepared for a future as a compassionate physician.","Throughout my life I have worked with individuals of different beliefs, cultures, and languages. Growing up outside of Chicago, many of my peers and friends came from different backgrounds. I have spent much of my lifetime studying Spanish and Latinx culture, and continue to develop my language and cultural awareness skills in the Emergency Department. While I am always learning from new interactions, I feel that much of my ability to understand diverse perspectives comes from my upbringing. Growing up with an identical twin sister who could not have been more dissimilar from me, we struggled to reconcile our differences. However, constantly lumped together despite opposing personalities, I gained an understanding for perspectives that are not my own. My experience being a twin taught me compassion and understanding for diverse perspectives. I will continue to develop these interpersonal skills through the challenges I face in the future, and look forward to using them at Rush.","At the outset of the pandemic, COVID-19 cases were disproportionately affecting low-income and minority individuals, people whose social determinants of health already put them at risk for many other diseases. Inspired by another organization spear-headed by Columbia University students, I co-founded the COVID-19 Student Service Corps at UVA, a service organization aimed at addressing the pandemic‚Äôs disproportionate effects. Within our first few months, we fundraised over $25,000 for local homeless shelters, provided over 300 face masks to UVA Health and low-income nursing homes, and supplied thank-you gifts to healthcare professionals. Born from a feeling of helplessness, CSSC gave me a voice in the community and allowed me to support local programs when they were struggling. While I wished I could have aided in patient care as a physician during the pandemic, I feel grateful that I was able to contribute through reducing disparities within my own community.",,,1,"During much of Spring/Fall 2020, undergraduate students were not allowed in class, in research labs, and in volunteering facilities. I conducted research in the Cui Lab of Orthopedics and contributed to a research project that we were trying to publish, but ultimately could not continue when the laboratory shut down in March 2020. I learned valuable research skills including cell culture, surgical procedures, animal handling, and data analysis which I will use in my future endeavors. In an effort to continue research during this time, I applied to work as a Clinical Research Assistant with the NIH Prevent COVID-U study. I worked in the UVA division of the study recruiting participants, recording data, and handling phlebotomy specimens. I feel privileged to have learned clinical research skills while contributing to the vaccination effort and will continue to improve the fields of medicine and public health in my future career.",1,0,2

In fact, I often found myself bombarding my family with questions whenever I encountered something unfamiliar or confusing. This trend, along with the fluency with which I spoke English at an early age, earned me the nickname Professor “Kasa Brofo”, courtesy of my grandfather. This phrase literally means “professor speaks English” in Twi, a Ghanaian language. Based on this, I have always known that I would like to pursue a career in a field that encourages an inquisitive nature. However, I did not develop an interest in becoming a physician until a trip back to my home country, Ghana, in the summer of 2015.
After a fun-filled start to my vacation, I spent the remainder of this trip bedridden. What had started as a sharp pain in my stomach was overshadowed by constant chills and feelings of nausea. No one in my family knew what to do except my grandma, a retired nurse. Upon seeing the state I was in, she sprung into action. She inquired about the onset of my illness and my symptoms. She then hypothesized what my illness was, received confirmation from a clinic doctor, and cared for me until I recovered. When I felt helpless, she listened to my frustrations and reassured me that everything would be okay.
Soon after I recovered, we returned to the United States. I would often reflect on the fearful thoughts I had while I was sick. At the same time, I grew increasingly appreciative of my grandma’s actions. I became curious about the impact of diseases and conditions on those they affect and how healthcare professionals work to address the issues their patients face. As a result, in true Professor Kasa Brofo fashion, I sought out opportunities that would grant me insight into these dynamics.
The following summer I began volunteering at a local hospital. During one shift, I heard a grunt coming from a patient awaiting surgery. They were unable to speak due to a thoat-related condition and were pointing to a nearby whiteboard. Once I handed them the whiteboard, they wrote that they needed to use the bathroom. Though I was unable to aid the patient myself due to my limits as a volunteer, I informed nearby nurses about the patient's request and they provided assistance. Not long after, this patient was transported to the operating room. As they exited, I heard echoes of physicians discussing their approach to operating on the patient’s larynx, and it delighted me to know that this patient would receive help. Freedoms often taken for granted, such as one's ability to speak, can be stripped away by diseases or conditions. Consequently, I became interested in becoming a physician as physicians, more so than other healthcare professionals, possess unique knowledge and skills to improve the quality of life of the afflicted.
After having this encounter, I began to wonder how physicians approach diseases and conditions that are not well understood or have no clear treatment. In college, I engaged in research on addictions and neurodegenerative diseases, and these projects were often led by physicians who used their clinical knowledge to infer the physiological implications of their findings. From this, I developed an appreciation for the research side of medicine and its role in improving our knowledge of pathologies and developing and improving treatments.
Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic made the importance of public health initiatives more evident, and I pursued a public health minor to become more informed on these matters. Through my minor, I was exposed to systematic measures to promote the health of entire communities. A common motif in my public health courses was how these measures often fail to address the uncontrollable circumstances one faces. Social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status or nationality at birth, are correlated with differences in susceptibility to certain conditions and illnesses. However, change is possible. From discussions with my family, I learned of how my grandfather, a parasitologist, played a role in eliminating Guinea worm, a neglected tropical disease that plagued Ghana for decades. As a physician, I hope to spearhead public health efforts and conduct clinical research aimed at improving the health of others locally and globally. Such efforts would include organizing educational campaigns, performing pro bono work in underserved communities, and studying diseases to develop and improve diagnostic and treatment methods.
These revelations into the complexities of the role of a physician and the significance of their work ultimately inspired me to become one. Those with impaired health can be facing one of the lowest points in their lives, and I have a desire to play a role in preventing people from suffering. Thus, for me, the meaning of Professor Kasa Brofo has morphed to mean someone with an inquisitive nature who employs their knowledge to care for others. As a physician, I aspire to investigate health issues and what is lacking in current approaches to address them. I aim to address those gaps while positively influencing the health of those in my community and all over the globe. Therefore, as I take this next step, I strive to become a physician who fully embodies what it means to be Professor Kasa Brofo.","In 2007, my family immigrated to the United States from our home country Ghana. I initially viewed this relocation as nothing more than a change in scenery, but I was gladly mistaken. Suddenly becoming the only Ghanaian in my classroom was quite a culture shock. However, my time in the United States has taught me valuable lessons. For instance, many of my peers have different ethnic and cultural backgrounds than my own. As my peers and I bonded through our shared interests, challenges, and experiences, I better understood that despite our more apparent differences, we have similarities worth appreciating. Furthermore, my peers and I have exposed each other to different cuisines, customs, and festivities. These exposures deepened my respect for other cultures, and I endeavor to share aspects of my culture with others when possible. As a student at Rush Medical College, I will aspire to continue this cultural exchange and promote an inclusive atmosphere for my peers and me to thrive.","Due to COVID-19, many families experienced difficulties, and these challenges perpetuated health disparities due to the societal and structural determinants of health._x000D_
In hopes of playing a role in reducing the pandemic's impact on my community, I volunteered at Table to Table, a local food distribution program. As I conversed with the families we assisted, many thanked my peers and me for our efforts, and some even mentioned they planned to distribute the food to family and friends who could not attend the food drive. Through these conversations, I better understood that the significance of our work went beyond the families we saw._x000D_
However, as the COVID-19-related restrictions reduced, the number of families we assisted gradually decreased from thousands to hundreds. Rather than lamenting, I recognized this indicated we were successful in helping our community during a difficult time. Consequently, I became even more grateful for having the opportunity to impact my community.",,,1,"When the quarantine period began, I returned home from campus and attended my classes remotely for three semesters. This transition was difficult due to the sudden loss of routine and having to deal with the challenges of remote learning and quarantine-induced social isolation. However, with time, I adapted to the situation._x000D_
I also had to withdraw from my research position at the Jamaica Plains VA Medical Center. Due to my role, I could not work remotely, and since I live in New Jersey, I could not routinely travel to Boston to fulfill my duties. Despite this, I remained determined to gain more research experience, and eventually, I obtained my current research assistant position. Furthermore, social distancing policies affected my ability to shadow physicians and volunteer in hospitals. In response, I found other ways to pursue my interest in medicine and impact my community. I participated in remote shadowing programs and volunteered with various organizations to help my community.",1,0,2

Parent-teacher conferences always yielded the same dreaded feedback: too talkative and too inquisitive. My chatty nature and spirited personality were reprimanded throughout my education. Such constant negative reinforcement shattered my self-confidence. It would take years to learn my talkative personality was not a character flaw but rather one of my greatest assets. Learning to appreciate my authentic self has been a journey filled with hard work, conscious reflection, and unexpected life lessons, but within it, my passion for patient care was catalyzed.  

My wavering confidence was tested with the arrival of my brother. When he was born, the same tropes that plagued me through parent-teacher conferences reared their ugly heads. With my mom in school and my dad battling his health, I was entrusted with raising my brother and became his closest companion. His personality was the complete opposite of mine: non-verbal, hypersensitive, and withdrawn. He failed to meet traditional child milestones and at age three, he had yet to utter a single word. After visiting several specialists, he was diagnosed with apraxia and autism. 

For my brother, my outgoing and talkative personality was of little use. It wasn’t an immediate realization but rather the culmination of many interactions. I was forced to develop an alternative to the communication style I depended on. At the time, I didn't realize it, but years of caring for my brother forced me to develop a new asset: adaptability. I soon recognized that, while my communication style wasn't negative, it wasn't always the answer. I soon adopted other means of communicating, working diligently to be the big sister my brother deserved. We learned basic sign language, communicated via visual aids, and developed our own language of symbols and gestures. 

Amid these pursuits to capture my identity, I grew accustomed to the reverberation of my father’s cries of immense pain. These bouts of pain were due to a series of chronic physical ailments stemming from an accident in his youth. His anguish peaked in 2016, as he awaited jaw replacement surgery. Just months after getting my driver's license, he entrusted my inexperience to rush him to the emergency room. Sitting by his side, I saw a broken spirit struggle to articulate his medical history. Feeling helpless, I found myself using the voice that I had grown ashamed of to advocate on his behalf. Rattled with nerves as two physicians stood over me, I was driven by a deep passion to share his story. As the doctors formulated a plan, I felt a wave of relief because my efforts were helping to ease my dad’s pain. What was once my biggest flaw had become my saving grace. 

While I listened intently to the physicians develop a detailed approach, something else happened: I came to the realization that these physicians talked just like me. They had a familiar, vibrant enthusiasm. I witnessed empathy delicately piece my father’s fractured optimism together. Quickly, I realized that even with an effective treatment regimen, comfort and empathy made the ultimate difference for my dad. In a strange way, my voice had helped me on the biggest stage.  

I continued to embrace internal reflection through my patient-care ventures. On my first day as a patient attendant, I approached a room of security guards. I was immediately cautioned that my patient had dementia and was incredibly violent. After hours of watching security struggle to calm him down, I began asking him about his life. He mentioned being a history professor and told me about his prior research endeavors. He shared amazing stories, ranging from investigations during the Vietnam war to working on journals as head historian. While unrelated to his condition, it was an integral part of his life. I immediately understood the power of lending one’s ear. Once again, Gabby Gavy fortified a relationship and eased stress through discourse, proving the power of my formerly burdensome voice. 

My dad’s cries, my brother’s struggles, and the nuances of my patients yielded a striking commonality: these tales slowly enveloped my life. Medicine provides an opportunity to amplify the patient story. In becoming a physician, I will leverage the opportunity to hear one’s story fostering an environment of holistic care that emphasizes communication as a tool that can save lives. My childhood experiences have instilled a special understanding that every patient requires a tailored form of communication. As a practitioner, I will strive to weave my empathy and medical knowledge to revolutionize the course of one’s medical journey.

Gabby Gavy, once my biggest insecurity, presented itself as a lifeline for those struggling most. Whether at home or in the hospital, I’ve seen the power of absorbing the patient story, as it grants the ability to connect with people beyond a superficial level. I see no alternative to medicine, my experiences have positioned me to use a former vulnerability to positively impact individuals. I believe that Gabby Gavy, with the complementary skills gained in medical school, will create special connections that will better patients’ lives.","My Michigan undergraduate experience brought me one unexpected gift: Chicago. With my partner there, I became a regular Chicago visitor and grew passionate about decreasing disparities in healthcare access throughout Chicago‚Äôs 77 neighborhoods. In 2019, I exited the familiarity of the midwest and flew to Peru on a service project to promote public health by building stoves in rural communities. My trip took a daunting turn as differing culinary practices resulted in a week‚Äôs stay in a hospital. Immersion in a new culture helped me challenge my thinking of common ethnocentrism and biases. Cultural competence and respect became my primary goal whether a rural villager, a doctor or a nurse. I saw substantial growth in my ability to empathize with and support those of different origins. Each hand-built stove brought a smile, a feeling that can‚Äôt be replicated within one‚Äôs own people. The value of each interaction was palpable, demonstrating the worth of diversity in stark practice.","My younger self was my brother‚Äôs keeper. With my mom working full time and my dad struggling with chronic disabilities, his growth was woven with mine. My brother faced significant developmental delays, forcing me to learn quickly how to empathize with someone fundamentally different than me. His success was directly linked to the care and support he received during his most formative years. Whether developing unique means of communication or advocating on his behalf, I became his biggest supporter. _x000D_

The impact I had on my brother was a local, isolated example. My influence grew when I shifted my advocacy to a community 6000 miles away. As COVID spread, I was tasked with contriving innovative solutions to ensure disabled Israelis had access to key resources like groceries, therapy, and entertainment amidst lockdowns. Both at home and abroad I developed a passion for disability-aware care and advocacy, ensuring that as a physician, I will foster positive change beyond my community._x000D_

I also had to depart from my student housing and move home with my family which entailed a stressful living environment. I was unable to work to support myself because there were immunocompromised individuals in my household. Due to the new remote format, it was difficult to personally acquaint myself with professors. Many of my professors used pre-recorded lectures and asynchronous office hours in which students preemptively sent questions. Whether financial, familial, or educational, the obstacles I faced during the pandemic had a profound impact on my college experience.",1,0,2

The faint sound of the hardwood floors creaking grows louder as the next patient passes the office for the nearby procedure room. I get up to help prep them and meet, “Anne,” a small woman confined to her wheelchair. As I help her onto the operating table, the discomfort she’s experiencing is clear. Tears flow down her face as she screams in agony at every inch moved. After the treatment, I help clean her and get her back into the wheelchair. I gather her personal belongings and notice the tears still running down her face, this time tears of relief. “I can move!” she screams to me. “I feel so much better!” While I wheel her towards the exit, she cries while telling the doctor how valuable his treatment was. This interaction epitomizes the reason I wish to pursue medicine: I am passionate about inspiring others through meaningful relationships and quality care. 
	My passion for healthcare developed when my brother was still young. The six and eight year age gap between my siblings and me meant I often took on the caretaker role as our parents worked. Slowly, I grew excited at the opportunity to not only take care of them, but to also be a potential role model and to tackle all the responsibilities that came with being a big brother. When my youngest brother, Gabe, was eight, he developed a bone tumor. Thankfully, it was benign, but the word “tumor” was still a significant cause of uncertainty and worry. The memory of helping carry my brother, still groggy from anesthesia, from the car to the couch will always be ingrained in my mind. His recovery was two weeks, and, in that time, I did my best to make him comfortable. While helping clean his 4-5 inch incision made me nervous the first time, the nerves soon gave way to fulfillment that I was playing a small part in his path to recovery. 
	From his diagnosis to checkups, I observed the reassuring and comforting effect that amazing doctors had not only on my brother, but also my family and me. The healthcare team was a light in a time of distress as they maintained the highest degree of compassion. Thereafter, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine. I experienced true joy in helping my brother recover and seeing him progress. The feeling was distinct from nervousness or excitement, it was a sense of euphoria that I had never felt before–it came from aiding in improving one’s well-being. I also fell in love with the idea of potentially being a bright light and positively impacting others the way my brother’s physicians had uplifted my family and I. 
	As I grew up, I found myself drawn to sports because of the cohesive feeling that comes with being part of a strong team. Few things are more rewarding than being part of a group of people contributing to achieving a common goal. Being a part of a team can connect people and form bonds like nothing else can, and I strongly desire a career that emphasizes teamwork while aligning with my personal values. When thinking of a strong team, I always think about my observation of a surgeon performing his first procedure at a new clinic. “Needle driver?” he asks before taking an X-ray. “We don’t have one, doc,” replies the team as they help him find an alternative. Later in the procedure, the TV projecting the X-ray develops problems and they switch to counting vertebrae by hand while viewing the small screen on the C-arm. The doctor counts aloud and the team helps corroborate the correct procedure site. Despite the wavering environment, I witnessed the physician collaborate with his team to successfully execute the surgery.
	My lifelong passion for science spurred me to seek out research opportunities in college, and those experiences have also pushed me in the direction of medicine. Though I explored interesting research topics and gained incredible learning experiences, I was quickly unsatisfied with the idea of performing research full time. My work in the lab lacked the patient-facing interaction that I had found so fulfilling during my clinical experiences. The type of relationships I have formed through research are completely different from the patient-physician ones I have seen. The ability to build bonds and form true, personal relationships with people from a variety of backgrounds while helping improve people’s quality of life is something unique that I have found only in patient care. 
	Time and time again I’ve been told that healthcare is a calling. Like most calls, we can decide to answer or ignore it. Being on the receiving end of care with my brother Gabe, observing the spine surgery, and experiencing research all furthered my passion to build meaningful relationships while inspiring patients and helping them regain a sense of regularity. Seeing the difference doctors can make in the lives of people like Anne solidified my decision to answer the call of healthcare in my own life. Hopefully one day I myself will influence someone else to answer their own call to medicine as I contribute to improving my patients’ quality of life.","Getting assigned random roommates my freshman year of college was an exciting opportunity for me to meet new people from various backgrounds. I was paired with someone who moved from China to attend college. Though we lived different lifestyles, It was important to me that I learn about his values out of respect and to build a healthy relationship. _x000D_
	_x000D_
I asked questions about his views on different topics and we had discussions about cultural differences. I even attended the ASU Mid-Autumn festival with him, a traditional Chinese celebration, in order to really learn more about his culture. I played traditional games, partook in celebratory traditions, and enjoyed authentic food. Taking initiative when learning about his culture was important to me in order to help him feel more comfortable in a new environment. From this experience, I took away the value in being open-minded and how it promotes respect and brings to light similarities between people of different backgrounds._x000D_
","In the height of the pandemic, I was only able to volunteer at the hospital‚Äôs front desk. With many regulations, we were put into situations that required strong social skills to best help visitors._x000D_

Denying visitation to the ICU was a testing situation. I think of when a young lady came in begging to see her dying father. With the maximum number of guests reached, we had to initially stop her from seeing him. Unable to verbally say much, I actively listened as I urgently tried to find a way to let her in. _x000D_
_x000D_
I learned the importance of nonverbal communication and consideration towards individual circumstances. Trying to understand the feelings of another was a necessary part of my role. It was common for guests to express frustration, but it was important to understand that it was not rooted in hostility, rather worry for a patient. It was fulfilling to play a part in connecting visitors with their loved ones and to try and lighten a guest‚Äôs day during an undesirable situation._x000D_
",,,1,"COVID-19 forced me to move back home and my grades suffered due to difficulty adjusting to an online format.

The pandemic also inspired me to tenaciously pursue various experiences to make up for what was lost. I grew even more motivated to connect with people I look up to.

The public schools I attended were underfunded and when the city declared bankruptcy, this further exacerbated the low quality of education provided to students in the district. In high school, I started to notice the impact of the lack of resources and insufficient staff and teachers. My high school’s graduation rate was well below the state average. While the school offered AP classes, most were poor quality and did not prepare students for the AP exam or college-level courses. When I took AP Chemistry, not a single student in my class passed the AP test. Moreover, Vallejo is a city where crime is rampant and I lost many peers to gun violence and the incarceration system. Interacting with my peers in class one day and the next day they were gone was traumatic. When my older brother passed away in a car crash during my junior year of high school, I struggled to find a new normal. So many young lives have been taken from my community which has taught me to be grateful for my life and opportunities.

Family and community are the foundation of my life and upbringing. I view my parents as role models, successful in their careers and life. From a young age, my brothers and I were involved in church and other organizations that uplift the Black community. These activities shaped my values such as giving back to those in need and striving for excellence. Community involvement brought me out of my shell from a shy girl to a confident and outgoing woman who loves to engage with others. My work in the community contributed to my growth, and provided me encouragement and support to pursue my dreams of becoming a physician.
My seventh-grade frog dissection planted the seed for a career in medicine. During class, I noticed the intricacies of the frog’s body, and I thought about the intricacies of the human body and how doctors work to heal people. From then on, I was intrigued by the idea of becoming a doctor. However, despite the culturally rich environment of Vallejo, it is one of three cities in California to declare bankruptcy; its public schools were severely underfunded, which negatively impacted my academic foundation. My high school lacked adequate resources, teachers, and access to AP classes. Although I excelled academically, this was not indicative of the preparation I needed to transition to college. To help me navigate the college admissions process, I relied on organizations such as the Willie B. Adkins Scholars Program (WBA), a free college preparatory program for Black students that provided support and resources to matriculate to college. WBA also connected me to my first clinical experience at Kaiser Permanente. In my senior year of high school, I interned at Kaiser and observed an emergency C-section. I was fascinated by the procedure and admired the quick and calm thinking of the providers. I left the operating room feeling that I could be one of those physicians in the future, further cultivating my desire to explore a career in medicine.
After high school, I matriculated at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I initially struggled to perform well in my science coursework and realized my high school education had not adequately prepared me for the rigor of college. To improve academically, I utilized campus resources, attended tutoring sessions, and developed better study strategies. Although these strategies helped my overall performance, I was not balanced, and I sacrificed personal care, which eventually led to burnout. In my determination to continue progressing, I spent my last year learning to balance academic and personal responsibilities, and my grades improved.  
After graduating from UCLA, I continued to explore my interest in medicine. I accepted an AmeriCorps fellowship at a Federally Qualified Health Center in Richmond, CA that serves a predominantly Black and Latinx population, similar to my community. I provided colon cancer health education, recruited patients for pregnancy and mental health support groups, and assisted with the Covid-19 vaccine efforts. As part of our outreach during the pandemic, I contacted patients with information about program resources, including our new group therapy sessions. One day, a woman answered the phone with an upbeat voice. She was excited to learn about and join our group therapy. She explained that as a teacher, she struggled to connect with her students through Zoom, in addition to having personal difficulties. I listened as she confided in me, and at that moment, I was glad to be a confidant to someone who needed to be heard. I learned the value of connections with patients and providing them with the space to express themselves. My engagement with patients strengthened my desire to become a physician who creates safe spaces and develops meaningful relationships with patients so they feel heard and seen. 
After finishing my AmeriCorps fellowship, I continued building my academic portfolio by completing the UCSF Post Baccalaureate Program. While in the program, I developed better study habits and established a stronger foundation in the sciences. I also gained confidence in my academic abilities and excelled in my upper division science courses while participating in research and graduate-level health disparities seminars. I attended and led a biweekly journal club on current health care topics impacting underserved populations. Our discussions and my engagement with like-minded peers further drives my passion for becoming a physician. I want to be a part of the effort to increase equitable access to health care for all. 
I believe everyone deserves a caring and compassionate physician who listens, especially patients from underserved and disenfranchised communities. I want to guide patients to live a healthy life no matter their socioeconomic status. My community instilled in me the value of giving back, and I want to serve my community and other vulnerable populations by providing excellent medical care. As a Black woman and future physician-advocate from an underserved community, I hope to inspire the youth who share my identities to never give up on achieving their dreams, despite the barriers they may face.","I completed my AmeriCorps Fellowship in Richmond, California, at a clinic where 60% of the patient population spoke Spanish. I was worried that I would not be able to communicate effectively with many of the patients. My Spanish was limited and although we had access to interpreters, I felt obligated to speak in their language as much as possible to make them feel comfortable. Every day during my drive to work, I used a program to learn and practice conversational Spanish, and my comprehension improved. However, as I learned more about language barriers between patients and providers and the negative impact on patient care and outcomes, I set the goal to continue learning. I saw how knowing even a little bit of my patients‚Äô language made a difference. As a physician, I am committed to providing culturally-sensitive care. I want my patients to feel comfortable regardless of their ethnicity or language. ","As an AmeriCorps Fellow, I helped combat food insecurity in the city of Richmond, CA, an urban underserved community in a food desert. I partnered with a local food bank to distribute free vegetables and groceries to about 60 members of the community every week. One day I spoke to a woman who had seen our flier and requested a food box delivered to her home as she could not make it to the clinic for our outreach. I assured her I could arrange for her to receive a weekly food delivery. Every time I brought the food box to her home, she thanked me for my service, and I was grateful to have the privilege of connecting with this woman while addressing her food insecurity. As a physician, I want to build meaningful relationships with my patients and engage with them to address social determinants of health in their community.

I adapted my learning style to accommodate Zoom lectures. After graduating from college, I was an AmeriCorp fellow at a federally qualified health center, working with patients from underserved communities. To continue pursuing my desire to become a physician, I participated in the UCSF Post Baccalaureate Program. The program was mostly virtual because of the pandemic. I used the same study methods I learned in my last quarter of college to excel in my science coursework. I again built connections with my professors by actively participating in Zoom lectures to increase the quality of my academic experience.

A sweltering heat baked all of us researchers and participants inside. That day, I oversaw the station to measure the participants’ height and weight. I kindly asked the next participant to come forward. A look of intrigue passed her face. I suspected like the others she was interested in how I looked like her yet spoke with such a weird accent. Afterwards, I escorted her to the next station for blood and urine collection.  I was a researcher for my university and Millennium Promise to address health effects of small-scale gold mining and mercury exposure in rural Amansie West, Ghana. I chose to be a part of this research because I wanted an opportunity to serve my Ghanaian community, specifically a medically underserved population. Although I am Ghanaian, the participants were of different economic class, educational background, and spoke Twi fluently. Learning how to communicate effectively and navigate cultural differences would prepare me for future patient interaction. 

Before starting the research, we talked to the residents about gold mining and mercury exposure. They observed that since the town had started mining more, people were getting sicker and dying younger. We, the researchers, were supposed to fill that gap. Even with our different areas of expertise, extensive research, and collaborative efforts, that gap was still monstrously vast. Not only did the gold mining cause occupational injuries, damage to organ systems, but the mass deforestation caused greater malaria outbreaks and food insecurity. Addressing and observing the intersections of global and environmental health I cared deeply about was more complex and challenging than I expected. 

My interest in medicine started young because of my mom. Growing up, I often heard, “no candy, no soda, desserts only once in a while, put the juice down and drink some water”. I believe my mom emphasized healthy eating choices not only because she was a Certified Nurse Assistant (CNA) but because as a Ghanaian, she had a holistic view of health. Ghanaians have a rich culture relying on diet, lifestyle changes, and herbal remedies. While I’ve had the privilege of over-the-counter medications, I also have the privilege of drinking ginger tea to soothe a cough. This perspective helped me to understand what health meant to the research participants. Their environmental and economic factors created such dire health inequities and a reliance on holistic medicine. Although I was not able to give medical advice, I observed how the local health professionals catered their medical advice to the participants’ views of medicine. I want to be a physician to culminate that holistic knowledge with medical treatment to improve the well-being of my patients.

This research informed my senior thesis on how heavy metals biomagnify in riparian systems. After working with the community residents, I never thought I’d be trudging through muddy ponds collecting algae and spiders to see effects of heavy metal exposure at an ecological level. Just as I had looked at the relationship between human health and the environment, I was able to be attentive and search for patterns among these pond organisms. However, the data was muddled and unclear. I read more papers, analyzed my limitations, and created different graphs and figures. I was able to form conclusions and identify future directions. Similar to a doctor, sometimes the results and diagnostics do not align with the original hypothesis. Often for patients, there is not always a clear diagnosis. Despite that, being a part of that scientific process has taught me how to synthesize knowledge to form new strategies to address a problem.

Post-graduation, I became a dialysis technician so that I could provide patient care for an underserved community. Most people at risk for kidney failure and subsequently need dialysis are low income and/or Black and Latino. Entering the world of dialysis, gave me exposure to what it’s like for patients to live with chronic disease. Before each treatment, I asked the patients how they felt and any health or life updates. In between the interesting stories of their misbehaved puppy or their adorable grandbaby, they would mention medically pertinent information. Often, the patients would disclose more information than I would expect. This established trust allowed me to effectively advocate for them. If a patient felt nauseous, I would recommend pulling less fluids. This was a preventative measure so that their blood pressure didn’t drop. Overall, treatment measures were determined by the physician orders. I was more interested in the procedures and designing of the treatment plans that the physicians did. Working with the patients made me eager for the future where I would have greater initiative over patients’ health.

My experiences have come full circle to confirm how intersectional health is. Medicine isn’t practiced in isolation. My life has culminated in me being competent to understand how to serve diverse patients and their needs. My upbringing, research, and clinical experience have given me a taste of healthcare. I want to practice medicine where I conduct the medical treatments and improve the health trajectory of my patients.","On the surface, I was the same as the study participants. We were all Ghanaians. Despite a shared culture, I couldn‚Äôt have been more different from the participants. In 2019, I conducted global health research in Ghana.

The first day of field research had severe communication barriers. It was difficult for the participants and me to understand each other. Frustrated with the communication difficulties, I began studying again. After every day of fieldwork, I watched videos for learning Twi and took notes late into the night. Over the weeks, my Twi improved. I was able to help the sampling team work more smoothly. I am still currently trying to learn Twi. Reflecting on this experience taught me how to be more culturally competent and forego any assumptions about people. ","In 2021, I joined Kramerica Gives as a mentor for high school students. Most of the students are low-income. Each mentor is assigned a mentee; I was assigned a senior student, JG. At the beginning of the school year, JG struggled academically. I focused on the goal of her graduating on time. As for JG‚Äôs academics, I helped her establish better study habits. In order to graduate, JG had to make up all the classes she failed in online courses. I introduced JG to the study method of scheduling study and break time and repeating. I told her to set goals for completing her coursework by specific dates. Each time she completed a course, I congratulated her, so she knew I believed in her abilities. Months later, I was able to cheer when JG walked across the stage for her graduation. Throughout the school year, I also supported JG in exploring her interests. She discovered her passion for healthcare and will enroll in a phlebotomy course. I am grateful that I could lead JG to academic success.",,,1,"The news of COVID-19 broke my junior year and I was sent home.

My dad and I hopped into our car early in the morning for a full day of driving. On the way to the hospital, my father introduced me to his favorite bands—the Beatles, Green Day, Wilco—and explained to me what the different parts of a song were. Reflecting on the nature of this trip now, my father was likely making an effort to distract me from the reason for our whole trip. All that I knew was that some doctor wanted me on a medication that my parents knew I would have to take every day for the rest of my life. Because a lifetime prescription was not ideal for their son, my parents sought a second opinion in Cleveland. I also knew that this hospital trip had something to do with my heart, but I did not understand what an “enlarged aortic root” meant. When we finally arrived at Cleveland, my dad and I checked into our hotel, where we stayed the night until we visited the hospital the following morning. 
	At the hospital, my dad and I spoke with several doctors, who then decided to perform an echocardiogram. Despite my fear of the foreign procedure, seeing the inward workings of my heart and watching it rhythmically beat was one of the most fascinating, entrancing scenes I had ever witnessed. I could not take my eyes off of the screen as the doctor named and described each of the valves of my heart. Watching the physician use such an intriguing machine to measure my heart valves in such a non-invasive procedure was something I did not know was possible. After this first hospital experience, I started asking all sorts of questions about the various tests the doctors ran, trying to understand each of them. In turn, the staff at Cleveland patiently explained them to me to make certain that I was comfortable. The compassionate hospital staff made a lasting impression on me. They somehow ensured that a terrified, confused six-year-old child felt at home and safe in an environment that was otherwise entirely new and unknown. Ultimately, my time in Cleveland ignited within me the desire to learn about the human body and medicine and how to use such knowledge to care for the people around me, as my first doctors did for me. 
This longing to learn and understand has only grown throughout my life since. Any time I would meet a medical professional, I would ask them how some test or piece of machinery functioned. Moreover, my experiences as a hospital patient led me to an interest in biology and human anatomy. I signed up for an elective anatomy and physiology class in high school, and eventually chose to major in biology at my undergraduate school, Dordt University. The countless questions that I had begun asking as a child continued to be answered in college, as I acquired an in-depth knowledge of biology through courses in histology, genetics, microbiology, and, of course, human anatomy and physiology. My time at Dordt, furthermore, allowed me to use this understanding to assist fellow students through my positions as a tutor and teaching assistant in the chemistry and biology laboratories. I had the valuable opportunity to help my peers grow by adapting information to their unique learning styles. 
My aspiration to care for others came to fruition in my college years in opportunities outside of school as well. Toward the end of my freshman year, I earned my EMT certification. During the following school year, I served as a volunteer for the local ambulance squad, a position in which I participated in emergency and inter-hospital transfer calls. Throughout this experience, I practiced treatment and patient relations in each call that I took. After my junior year, I spent the summer as an EMT for Superior Air-Ground Ambulance Services, near my home in Indiana. While serving there, I worked alongside a paramedic for interhospital transfers with critical patients as well as led basic life support cases. I found great fulfillment in caring for my local community through this position. I appreciated the opportunity to hear and learn from the individual stories of my diverse patients and to exist as a positive example of a healthcare provider. In this role, I met people at their most vulnerable points and did all that I could to assist them, both physically and emotionally. Not only did this pre-hospital setting magnify my desire to help and care for others in the medical field; it further encouraged me to continue my education so that I could improve my ability to do so.
	Overall, I believe that my unique, personal experiences both inside and outside of the hospital have given me invaluable, empathetic insight into what is like to be both a patient and a care provider. Knowing the indispensable difference that a positive, compassionate care team can make on an individual, I feel called to the work of a doctor. I can think of no greater privilege—to serve and provide care for those who need it most and to make what I hope is a positive impact on my community.","When I was studying at Dordt University, I took several Spanish classes which gave me the opportunity to practice speaking Spanish with native speakers. These tutors came from various countries in South and Central America. Our one-on-one sessions consisted of us talking about our lives and how were were raised. While I gained a greater appreciation for the language, I was given a first hand account of what life was like in countries such as Paraguay and Guatemala. They gave me a wonderful view of their cultures, from the food all the way to family life. It was eye-opening to understand their experiences in their native language. It taught me just how different all of us can be. It challenged my thinking of what I understood as universal experiences. Overall, it showed me just how important it is to talk to others to hear their stories so that we may truly understand them. ","I would say that one of my most meaningful positions was as a tutor at Dordt University. In this role, I interacted with all types of students for many different classes. By my senior year, I was tutoring around 10 hours a week for groups as large as 10. The most challenging part of this position was adapting the information to each student's learning style. As I assisted these students in their learning, I was able to promote good study habits and positive attitudes. The most obvious change I could see were the students who had tutoring with me over various years. At first, I do think they needed a bit of guidance. But, after the first year I think they came to my sessions just out of familiarity.  When I graduated, they told me ""I'm not sure what we will do without you next year"". I just told them that I wasn't necessary for me to stick around, they had become great students. Overall I not only gave my students knowledge, but confidence in themselves.",,,1,"I do believe that COVID-19 did impact my application and preparation for medical school when it comes to my shadowing hours. The pandemic affected all healthcare systems and prevented most shadowing opportunities that I had. Also, my mother was diagnosed with cancer at this time and I did not want to risk exposing her to the virus as her chemotherapy weakened her immune system. Since I lived at home, I couldn't in good conscious go out and risk her health. Also, though I was away from home for my undergraduate education, I was not able to start shadowing due to my coursework and various positions until my senior year.",1,0,1
2023,15532308,,25,Man,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"As Muslim-Iranians, my family and I have been directly affected by the racial and socio-economic barriers that surround our healthcare system. Compassionate health care that is culturally-sensitive is a fundamental human right that we cannot afford and do not have access to. Specifically, racism and racial bias have created a lack of Muslim-Middle Eastern physicians in the Denver area, which creates a disparity for Muslim and minority patients. By becoming a physician, I will actively address this disparity within my medical practice. I will support all disadvantaged patients and address health care disparities within my community. Furthermore, due to my parents limited income, maintaining a livelihood has been a struggle, and at certain times we have relied on welfare programs to survive. Also from an early age, I have worked full-time to financially support the needs of my family. Despite these challenges within my life, I know that I can overcome adversity through hard work, dedication, and intellect. I have also learned the value of sublimation: instead of being discouraged due to these circumstances, I transform the negative experiences within my life into a positive power for good that will help others.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,12002,1608.0,400.0,448.0,1744.0,114.0,1,848,1,2258,09/11/2021,Regis University,Biochemistry; Mathematics,0,,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Less than $25,000",4,1,1,1,50.0,40.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,Adequate,2,2023,2,1.0,0.5,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"When I was 11 years old, my family was hit with horrible news: my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. To make matters worse, we did not have the proper health insurance or finances to cover her treatment. Access to and the cost of doctor visits, surgeries, and additional treatments became a barrier in the path to curing my mother’s cancer. Only through the help of welfare and Medicaid, was my mother able to receive the treatment that she needed. My mother battled breast cancer for two years straight and underwent a mastectomy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy to become cancer-free.
Despite the barriers in the path to curing my mother’s disease, we were truly fortunate to overcome this adversity. However, this is not the reality for most poor and marginalized patients. Proper treatment and personalized health care are fundamental rights that they will never access or afford. As such, providing treatment to disadvantaged patients is my personal motive for studying medicine and becoming a physician. Specifically, I aim to provide free health care to poor and uninsured patients by partnering with non-profit organizations.
The Jesuit tradition is rooted in providing service to the poor and marginalized, and pursuing justice on behalf of all people. By studying at Regis University, I actively pursued these Jesuit values alongside my science education. Personally, I integrated community service into my education by volunteering at the university chapel. During my free time, I worked at the chapel and provided service to the homeless population of Denver. Making meals, fundraising money, and donating clothes were some of the ways that I helped. I also pursued justice for disadvantaged people through my knowledge of biochemistry and mathematics. By working as an undergraduate research assistant, I investigated the therapeutic use of a cancer therapy drug, lumazine. This research project addressed complications and barriers to cancer treatment. Specifically, I optimized the irradiation time and dosage concentration of lumazine in such a manner that would reduce damage to healthy cells and the cost of treatment. This research project and volunteer work greatly transformed my science education by providing a foundation of service rooted in helping those who are less fortunate.
By using my Jesuit education and research experience, I served my community during the COVID-19 pandemic. I volunteered as a laboratory assistant at the Regis University COVID Testing Center and provided free RT-PCR and ELISA testing. Within poor-minority communities, such as my own, underlying disparities were further exacerbated such that people were getting sick and dying from the virus at disproportionally higher rates. This disparity was partially caused by barriers in the path to proper testing. By providing free and easy-to-access testing, I took a crucial first step in overcoming health care disparities and effectively combatting COVID. I also assisted Student Health Services with patient sample collection, contact tracing, and a vaccination drive that provided free flu shots. Through this volunteer experience, I learned that health is much more than the absence of disease. While COVID cases have decreased recently, the disparity in COVID’s impact is still present. Declined mental health and increased substance abuse are some of the long-lasting consequences that we must deal with. As such, it is my ongoing duty to address these problems within my community.
Currently, I work as a professional research assistant (PRA) within the laboratory of Dr. Ramon Lorca at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. I really enjoy this research position because of the innovative approach that we are taking to solve gaps in patient treatment. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an adverse condition during pregnancy which increases neonatal mortality, and there are no treatments for the condition. Our research will overcome this gap in treatment by developing a novel mouse model of IUGR using optogenetics. The validation of this model will allow for the future development of treatments and preventative therapies. Furthermore, the translational nature of this research has shown me the link between the bench and the bedside. I have learned that the most effective physicians incorporate research and investigation into their medical practice. By working as a PRA, I have gained crucial research skills that will hopefully build the foundation for me to become a successful physician-scientist.
Reflecting upon my mother’s disease and the impact that it has had on my life, I remembered a fond childhood memory of doing math problems with her. I remember the countless hours sitting at the kitchen table with my mom while we worked through my geometry homework. Now, I look back at those childhood tutoring sessions with deep admiration. Despite her struggles, my mom always found the time to help me and sacrificed so much to always be there for me. As a Jesuit student, research scientist, and future physician, I hope to have this same effect on the lives of my patients. No matter the struggles that I may face, I will always be there to uplift and serve others.","By attending Regis University, I had the opportunity to pursue a Jesuit education that sought to build a more just and compassionate world. As a Jesuit student, I stood in solidarity with others and embodied the spirit of providing service to the poor and marginalized. Through this experience, I was seeking to answer the question, ‚ÄúHow ought we to live?‚Äù._x000D_
After extensive reflection on this question and my experiences, I understand and recognize that Muslim, Iranian, and Middle Eastern individuals are underrepresented within medicine. This represents a disadvantage for all Middle Eastern patients as they are not receiving medical care that is conscious of their personal needs. Furthermore, I understand and recognize that there is an overall lack of diversity among physicians and healthcare professionals. As such, I want to build a diverse and inclusive environment within healthcare that both supports Muslim-Middle Eastern individuals and all healthcare professionals and patients.","As a minority who comes from a low-income household, I am no stranger to the opportunity gap that exists in higher education. Specifically, individuals from minority communities are hindered from attending college and achieving academic success. To address and correct this disparity, I volunteered with Colorado ‚ÄúI Have A Dream‚Äù and provided assistance to disadvantaged students within my community. _x000D_
By volunteering as a mathematics tutor, I provided personalized tutoring sessions and a holistic learning experience for my student ‚ÄúDestiny‚Äù. Through the consideration of Destiny as a whole person and not solely focusing on her academic achievement, I exercised mental, physical, and spiritual growth. I believe that these efforts have been impactful as Destiny improved her math grade, aced her final exam, and developed a passion for mathematics. Furthermore, my volunteer work is ongoing as I hope to further educate, inspire, and remove barriers to higher education for disadvantaged students.",,,1,,1,1,1
2023,15534392,,25,Woman,USA,0,,0,1,"My financial and social circumstances throughout childhood contribute to who I am today. My dad was unemployed twice for long stretches, and during each, we did not have access to insurance. My mother developed a painful gynecological health condition during the second unemployment and could not afford to get help until his new job during my junior year. This position was across the country and I took on several responsibilities in the household on top of school—driving my brothers to commitments, taking care of errands, working part-time, and keeping the house running when my mom was not able to. 

I also learned how being a woman of color impacts how others see me from a young age, and in school, I dealt with racism and discrimination for my religious identity. I had to fight to show I belonged in advanced classes, clubs, and honor societies, and struggled with stress and anxiety from belittlement from both students and adults.

As a result of these experiences, I matured quickly and grew stronger. I became resourceful and driven, and worked to overcome the long-lasting effects of what I went through by exploring my passions and discovering a strength for advocacy. I have grown immensely as an individual, and in retrospect, I believe the way I responded to my struggles is my greatest strength.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,3480,810.0,295.0,410.0,,25.0,1,705,1,320,03/25/2022,Loyola University Chicago,Global and International Studies,0,,No,No,Don't Know,"$100,000 - 124,999",5,1,1,0,38.0,10.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,15,Exceptional,4,2023,2,5.0,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,"It has been a handful of weeks since I earned my learner’s permit. The highway is still terrifying to my seventeen-year-old self. The Garden State Parkway is not meant for weak hearts, especially not my white knuckles as I grip the steering wheel, seat pulled up so close that I am inches away from the horn. This car doesn’t have air conditioning either–the ’97 Camry is not built for a fifty-mile trip, but the minivan is off for service.

I have to take the wheel, metaphorically and literally. My mother is in no shape to drive, and my father is across the country, working at a new job after a long unemployment. My mother has endured a litany of reproductive health issues. She has been suffering from severe, prolonged uterine bleeding, and as of today, it has reached the point where I am washing her clothes every other day.

“Do you have any family history of medical conditions?”

This is the longest part of triage during every trip to a new medical professional. Usually, I hear the answer from my mother, expecting her to rattle off generations of conditions. For the first time, it is my turn to run through the list for someone else.

While I had visited family members in the hospital after procedures, I could always lean on my parents to step in when it felt too overwhelming. This was different. My biggest support system was the person that was dealing with an illness. I felt drawn to the way my mother’s doctors used their voices. I saw how they worked with her, taking the time to hear her pain and offer advice, comfort, and validation all at once. My experiences with my family and community taught me the discomforts experienced by immigrants in hospital settings, and I wanted to be an advocate for them, particularly women that went through the hardships my mother did.

After two semesters of bouncing between majors, wanting more from my degree beyond science prerequisites, I tied pre-med with my interests in multicultural politics and advocacy with a major in international studies.

Student Government was the first organization I joined in college. It introduced me to the impact of advocacy on a college campus and forced me to confront my fear of public speaking. Speeches, presentations, and meetings with administrators were no longer barriers–they were pathways I leveraged to advocate for my peers. My first meeting with a university official was with a member of the Wellness Center, as was the last. This “full-circle” moment may have ended in the same meeting room, but the person that walked in during my last meeting had accomplished several initiatives, left action plans for many more, and grew through each of the leadership positions held in the organization. The Senator that fumbled through notes on a proposal for resources to support a smoke-free campus was now Chief Health and Wellness Officer, presenting the organization’s vision for embedded wellness as part of the university’s Strategic Plan. The work I had done to advocate for student needs, especially through the last year and half of COVID, had inspired me to envision a future where I tackled the task of improving public health outcomes through daily interactions with patients.

While Student Government taught me to think creatively to tackle student health on campus, it was my clinical experience that allowed me to witness the immense vulnerability felt by patients in clinical settings. As a volunteer at Swedish Hospital and Rush Copley, I was able to assist a diverse population of patients. Whether it be providing blankets, delivering flowers, or wheeling patients to appointments, I valued the connections I formed and the chance to ease their anxieties, even if for just a minute.

“Linda” was an elderly woman I met while volunteering in the PCU. She was recovering from surgery after a fall. This procedure may have been common, but it was Linda’s story that served as a reminder of how completely medicine can transform lives. Linda was an avid athlete. She played tennis, badminton, rowed, and ran for charity, despite her age. Her fall had put an end to an active lifestyle, and she explained that what began as hopelessness transformed into determination to work towards healing upon the encouragement of her physicians. I enjoyed the ability to sit with her and listen, aiding in simple tasks, and helping her read the note cards attached to her flowers.

When I reflect on why I want to be a doctor, I think about the heart disease that has affected my family over the past several generations. I think about the funerals I could not attend during the pandemic, caused by COVID entering a household of vulnerable elders. I think about the food pantry housed in one of the predominantly South Asian areas of Chicago, guiding community members through the process with accented Urdu. I think about the refugee girls I mentored and tutored, finding sisterhood and providing any support I could while they lived in defiance of the conflict they’d escaped. I think about the ways I have learned to love to make a difference, no matter how small, in the relationships I have built with others. My passions lay within a mix of human interaction, medical curiosity, and outreach, and as a physician, I strive to combine them to bring the best care to my patients.","‚ÄúAnna‚Äù was a first-generation student I tutored in writing. I supported her in transforming her frustration into a love for authoring autobiographical stories. Her writing was vivid and meaningful, painting a picture of her wistfulness over the vibrant country she had left behind. Through this all, she tackled her family‚Äôs financial issues, taking time off studying to work. Her status as a recent immigrant made her the target of microaggressions, and she dealt with this stress on top of the burden of maintaining her household. Anna was a role model for me in the way she honored her culture and family in what she did, but she was also an example of how disparities impact every sector of life._x000D_

In working with students like Anna, I have learned about the richness that comes when people have access to the resources to achieve. My own work with people from a variety of backgrounds has broadened my perspective of the human experience and makes me passionate about sharing these reflections.","In the times I helped locate healthcare and food in an already under-resourced area, I felt frustration with a system that had caused so much stress for the immigrant and refugee girls at GirlForward.

This was not a realization I thought I would ever make, but it's significant to the type of physician I aspire to be. On March 30, 2020, I received the following email from my university: ""Dear students, effective immediately, everyone is not to return to campus for the rest of the semester. The university will transition to remote learning as the campus will be effectively closed. In addition, Trinity athletics will be canceled."" While the full 600-word campus update was more informative, this was how my brain first processed the information. From my point of view, everything was being stripped away from me. I could no longer have in-person classes/labs, shadow physicians, play soccer, or even see my friends. 

Logically, I understood that this transition was made to protect the health and wellbeing of our communities. However, this understanding did not make it any easier emotionally. One day, after logging off from my chemistry lab zoom class, I got ready for soccer practice only to remember I didn't have practice for the foreseeable future. While I was sad, this was my new normal. I had to make the best of it. Since the pandemic was emotionally draining for everyone, I wanted to make something to lighten up my family's mood and do something challenging that got my science brain thinking. That's when my journey of becoming a makeshift baker began. Over the next six months, I went into bread baking boot camp. And let me tell you, it wasn't easy. My first month was a combination of utter failures and setbacks. From my yeast farm never actually being strong enough to raise dough to French baguettes that tasted like fermentation (and not in a good way). 

Eventually, after some trial and error testing various water/flour/yeast ratios and long nights of YouTubing, ""How the heck do you make dough rise?"", I finally produced my first bread loaf. It was small and weirdly formed, but I made it, and it tasted good. Seeing my family's faces light up when I shared my bread with them amplified my happiness. At that moment, I knew all my hard work was worth it. For the next few months, I learned how to make almost every variation of bread and pastry, experimenting with different flavors, toppings, and techniques until I had an arsenal of bread recipes at my disposal. 

I discovered that the emotional and fundamental aspects of bread-making are the root of my interest in medicine and why I decided to major in neuroscience. The heart of making bread is understanding the fundamentals of how flour, water, and yeast interact. This knowledge boils down to the core basics of math, biology, physics, and chemistry. While you can expand on this knowledge by adding additional ingredients and using different techniques, the core foundation is still the same. This foundation can make over 100 different types of bread. The medical field is similarly situated. Physicians must first master those exact four basic sciences before they are integrated and expanded upon in our preclinical years of medical school. This foundation can then be applied to over 135 specialties and subspecialties, each with its own skill sets and techniques. 

As for the emotion, making bread was fun and challenging, but the happiness I felt sharing my bread with my family made it that much more worthwhile. The basic sciences and sociology courses I took as an undergrad were engaging and challenging. However, I observed the integration of basic sciences and sociology, watching Dr. Garrett perform colonoscopies and other surgeries. In addition, witnessing the emotional satisfaction Dr. Garrett and her team demonstrated when successfully changing patients' lives was amazing. I also observed how healthcare changed the lives of children and gave them a second chance at a quality life with their families and friends through my participation with The Children's Hospital of San Antonio and TigerThon. 

I noticed that the emotional and mental aspect of medical care is crucial for the patient and the physician. Medical care is as much physical as it is mental healing. I learned this from witnessing the medical journey of others but also from my medical journey. I have had injuries to my ankle, knee, and back playing soccer. My dad, who did a dual residency in internal medicine and psychiatry, always explained my injuries from a physical and mental perspective. He explained that it is essential to consider both when caring for patients. I saw this duality firsthand with the physicians who helped me and in the ones I shadowed-seeing this dual nature of patient care and the love these physicians have for what they do. 

Baking bread is a microcosm of the medical field because physicians must first understand the fundamentals before applying this knowledge to help patients overcome obstacles and live their lives to the fullest. In addition, no physician acts alone. Like no single yeast can raise a whole loaf of bread, it takes an entire team of physicians and healthcare providers to give patients the necessary tools to heal. I have seen it again and again, both in my medical journey and witnessing the medical journey of others.","For three weeks, I was able to experience Spain‚Äôs wonderful culture firsthand learning how to dance traditional flamenco and how to prepare many culinary dishes. This was my first time out of the country without my family, so it was a unique chance for me to get out of my comfort zone and immerse myself in a culture that is completely different from my own. This experience opened my eyes to the considerations I want to make as a physician, especially when treating patients from different cultures. For example, there may be treatments in traditional American medicine that are considered not acceptable for some patients due to the traditions of their culture. I believe it is my job as their physician to recognize these differences and help them around these barriers to create a safe space for all my patients to receive quality and personalized care._x000D_

The man who rescued her was a doctor; he saw her lying lifeless on the ground and brought her to safety. The Nazis had taken everything from her: her family, her youth, her hair, and now almost her life. For three months, she lay in a hospital bed on the brink of death, and the doctor visited her every day. She experienced the ultimate injustice and lived to tell the story, wishing me only one thing: to help those suffering. 
Grandma instilled in me the duty to aid others–tzedakah, in Jewish terms–but I didn’t realize that my path to achieving this would be through medicine until late into undergrad. Entering college, I wanted to learn about everything. I had always been an avid reader and writer, yet I was similarly engrossed in math and science. I could envision myself as a novelist as much as a mathematician. I often felt pressured to choose a specific path, to focus on one discipline that I could call my own. As time went on, everyone found their niche, but I couldn’t choose. I spent my first two years taking classes exploring poetry, music, math, gender, and philosophy. In my first chemistry class, however, I realized science was my true love.
In organic chemistry, I became infatuated with reaction mechanisms. Each synthesis problem felt like a puzzle, and I loved challenging myself to find the best solution. I was amazed that by combining chemicals, we could synthesize compounds and that the information we learned was being applied to create life-saving drugs. Biochemistry combined my passion for mechanisms and my interest in the human body. I was awestruck by the intricacy of essential processes like glycolysis and thermoregulation. As I learned more, I began to see how everything was intertwined; the muscles I learned about in physiology behaved like the springs in physics, and the math I learned about in physical chemistry was applied to the kinetics in biochemistry. The big picture was striking, and I was eager to learn more.
Suddenly, my path became obvious. My love for science and my desire to help others formed a perfect intersection in medicine. I had never felt like I was destined for something before, but after realizing I wanted to be a doctor, I couldn’t imagine myself doing anything else. The idea that I could use science to help people was intoxicating, and I knew that I would devote my life to doing so. 
Once I began to imagine a career in medicine, Grandma’s words felt like a prophecy. I wanted to be like the healer that saved her life–the one that made mine possible. Shadowing physicians at Lenox Hill Hospital made it clear that I made the right choice. While observing a cardiologist visit her patients, I realized how many different people doctors encounter every day. Patients varied in age, race, size, ability, and gender, yet the cardiologist treated everyone with the utmost respect and kindness. Although each patient had their own background, their stories converged on the white table of the exam room. Most of them were scared–sick with or at risk for heart disease–and looking to their doctor for guidance. I was in awe of the cardiologist’s candor and confidence as she spoke to her patients clearly and carefully, and I wanted to one day do the same.
The clinical research that I participated in reaffirmed this commitment. Interacting with patients was incredibly eye-opening and enhanced my love of medicine. Since the participants had been diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease and had at least two uncontrolled risk factors, they were understandably worried about the future of their health. Through the study, I had the chance to teach patients about various ways that they could implement lifestyle changes to control their risk factors. I was inspired by the hopefulness that arose in the patients once given the knowledge that they could drastically improve their health by changing aspects of their daily routine. Upon seeing their renewed confidence, my drive to aid others through medicine was further ignited. 
Through my clinical experiences and advocacy work, I developed an interest in providing care to women. I would love to utilize my knowledge of trauma-sensitive care in combination with my scientific studies to create a safer space for women. It would be a privilege to continue to do research and ultimately design a standard of care that is catered specifically to the treatment of women and other marginalized groups of people. I want to help people who have suffered trauma and show them that their bodies and minds are resilient, as the doctor did for my grandma. 
My road to pursuing a career in medicine was anything but straightforward. I was not born knowing I would one day become a doctor. However through exploring my many interests, science and medicine called to me. Although I felt frustrated at times because I didn’t have a clear path, I now realize that my time exploring various disciplines was a blessing. I can confidently say that becoming a physician is what I am meant to do, and I know that Grandma would be proud.","‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt believe that I made them,‚Äù she said, gazing down at the earrings. Doreen‚Äôs eyes were sparkling, wet from emotion. I was leading a crafting workshop at a senior center when I guided Doreen through making a pair of earrings for her daughter. I was surprised; I hadn‚Äôt expected her to become emotional about accomplishing something that had seemed simple to my nimble hands. For Doreen, however, this was no menial task but an extraordinary feat. This was the first time I realized my privilege being able-bodied; I took for granted my ability to complete physical tasks like using my hands and walking upstairs. Working at the senior center changed my perspective and opened my eyes to the challenges that many older adults and people with disabilities continually face. For the rest of my time at the center, I ensured that all events were accessible and committed to learning more about disability justice; I hope to incorporate anti-ableist practices into my clinical care at Rush.","In May 2020, I was informed that my college's administration was writing a new Title IX policy without input from students or professionals trained to work with survivors of sexual violence. Upon hearing this information, I was extremely worried about the well-being of students who would be subjected to this policy in the future. A group of advocates and I banded together and convinced the administration to let us review the policy and present revisions to the board. Many challenges came with this, including the fact that everything had to be done remotely. I took on the responsibilities of organizing virtual meetings and ensuring that the other advocates remained motivated and committed to the cause. After months of back-and-forth with the administration and legal team, almost all of our revisions were accepted into the final policy. Although the process was frustrating at times, it is rewarding to know that we made a lasting difference that will protect survivors for years to come.",,,1,"Being sent home in March 2020 due to the pandemic meant traveling across the country from my college in California to my childhood home in New York. Living with an immunocompromised and extremely high-risk family member while at the epicenter of the pandemic meant taking every possible precaution to keep our family safe. The fear of what might happen if COVID entered the house was daunting; yet, I knew I was incredibly fortunate. There were people in the same position as me who didn‚Äôt have access to the resources I did. Thus, I decided to figure out how to serve my community without putting my family member at risk. By utilizing Zoom and social media, I was able to lead virtual initiatives to support those who are underserved. I held mask-making workshops via Zoom and started a mutual aid fund for low-income students at my school. By utilizing these contactless forms of service, I was able to contribute to my community while ensuring that I didn‚Äôt endanger my family.",1,0,2

Music is my genesis, it is the spark that ignited my passion for medicine. From the age of two, I have been enchanted by the melodies of Carnatic music, an ancient style of Indian classical music. What began as a toddler’s imitation of her mother’s lullabies evolved into an intensive study of music vital to the formation of my character. The 4 AM vocal exercises instilled discipline; the improvisational style of Carnatic music fostered creativity; the drive to continually grow as a singer blossomed into a love for lifelong learning. 

For the past four years, I have had the privilege of imparting the rich tapestry of classical music to children with disabilities – an experience that has arguably taught me more than my students. My first student was Karuna, a 16 year old girl with perfect pitch and moderate autism spectrum disorder. “Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Da Ni Sa,” I sang the notes of the first scale taught in Carnatic music, asking Karuna to repeat after me. Silence filled the air as her dark brown eyes remained focused on the floor, her face blank. Undeterred, I gently encouraged her to participate by playing icebreaker games to slowly coax her out of her shell. While she eventually echoed individual notes with remarkable accuracy, she was unable to string them together. My unspoken frustration with the failure of traditional training exercises was dwarfed by my unwavering belief in her potential, spurring me to research and incorporate techniques utilized in music therapy. Following our third class, Karuna’s mom tearfully confided in me that her teachers had deemed Karuna incapable of learning to read. As I held her hand and offered what solace I could, my resolve to nurture my students’ wellbeing solidified. 

“Bhavani, Bhavani! Look at this!” Karuna exclaimed after class. Eyebrows furrowed with concentration, she slowly enunciated the words of her first book. Several months of creatively adapting music therapy techniques into the rigorous curriculum of Carnatic music yielded incredible success. Karuna’s verbal communication, fine motor control, and confidence dramatically improved to the point where her healthcare team asked what treatment was responsible. Her ailing grandmother even thanked me for the gift of seeing her oft nonverbal and unresponsive granddaughter come alive after music lessons. Witnessing the powerful impact I had on the health and lives of my students was truly humbling. 

While I had been set on a career in scientific research, I realized that I craved this direct human impact as well. Through teaching music, I discovered my passion for understanding people’s stories and uplifting underserved communities. I was left with the feeling of wanting something more than expanding the boundaries of knowledge from my future career. However, I did not make the connection to medicine until the spring of my sophomore year, when I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. 

My time as a patient was marked by the rhythmic beeping of a heart rate monitor, the harsh glare of overhead lamps, and the coppery tang of fear. While I had been symptomatic for the past year, receiving my diagnosis was both a blessing and a curse. Having an answer for the paralyzing fatigue ravaging my body and brain was initially a relief, but only precipitated more terrifying questions. Hours upon hours of scouring PubMed helped ground me in the endless sea of uncertainty. Science was the beloved, well-worn blanket to which I clung. Delving into the hormonal interactions of the menstrual cycle in the classroom and performing ovariectomies on mice subjects in the lab were now imbued with real application, coming alive in a way they never had before. But it was spending time with my doctors that changed my life. The delicate humor Dr. Wilson blended into her explanations of the progression of disease, the attentive gaze of Dr. Park as he actively listened to my concerns about side effects, and the compassion with which Dr. Shah dried my tears meant the world to me. I desperately longed to support patients at their most vulnerable, scared, and exposed, as my healthcare team had done for me. Every aspect of being a physician – serving as an advocate, healer, scientist, mentor, leader and educator — resonated deeply with me and my heart sang with purpose. The only future I could envision for myself was on the other side of the hospital bed as a doctor. 

My lifelong love of music brought me to my career in medicine. Teaching children with disabilities kindled my fiery dedication to improve equity in healthcare, but it was my experiences as a patient that cultivated my appreciation for the transformative power of medicine. Upon my full recovery, I pursued my dream of being a physician through researching the mechanisms of uterine fibroid growth, creating reproductive healthcare workshops for women in rural India, and developing a therapy chatbot app to make mental health treatment more accessible. I hope to further explore my passions for narrative medicine, global health, and applications of technology to healthcare in medical school. I embark upon this lifelong journey with the goal of making a meaningful difference in the lives of patients like Karuna and myself.","Braving a barrage of discordant chants, I reached the car entering the Planned Parenthood clinic in Nashville. As I accompanied the young woman inside through the clinic, I learned that Imani was desperately hoping for access to reliable health information as she had received no sex education at school. Imani hailed from the Black community in North Nashville and attended an underfunded school with a dismal graduation rate, worlds away from my hometown in a suburban immigrant enclave with excellent public schools. I left my shift that day determined to share the knowledge I had with those that had not received the same opportunities. For Imani and others like her, I am passionate about improving access to reproductive healthcare education for vulnerable communities. To pursue this mission, I developed a series of sexual and reproductive health educational workshops for women in rural India. I hope to learn to employ education to ameliorate reproductive health disparities at Rush. ","Araavani. This Tamil term for gender and sexual minorities is embedded in the colorful mosaic of my existence. Bridging my identities as a queer brown woman has shaped my awareness of how systems of inequality intersect. It was this understanding I called upon when Claire, my classmate who recently came out as trans to her Korean parents, confided in me that she had nowhere to go home for the summer. Accounting for her undocumented immigration status, I was able to find transitional housing for her through a nonprofit that did not require identification for services. It was with individuals like Claire in mind that I founded Queer & Asian, an affinity group at Vanderbilt that cultivated intersectional dialogue on campus. I continue to contribute to my community by volunteering with LGBTQ+ teens experiencing homelessness in Chicago. I hope to apply my perspective to equitably serve patients of all backgrounds with an understanding of how structural barriers affect their health. ",,,1,"When COVID-19 swept the world in 2020, I was taking a medical leave of absence from college to recover physically and emotionally from the toll of ovarian cancer. I had been volunteering as an EMT and participating in a survivorship rehabilitation program, both of which were abruptly halted due to the pandemic. I adapted to these unprecedented challenges by shifting to a successful self-directed recovery plan and delving deeply into independent projects that could be pursued remotely. One such endeavor was developing educational workshops about sexual and reproductive health for women in rural India with limited access to resources in this area. The pandemic shaped my views on the vital importance of public health education as a critical part of patient understanding and confidence when interacting with health systems.

With my packet of Spanish medical phrases in hand, I smiled at the first family as they walked into the classroom-turned-temporary triage center. The mother smiled back as she tried to get her bickering children to settle down; a scene reminiscent of my own mother trying to manage my siblings and me. As my anxiety started to dissipate, I began to wonder what more I had in common with the residents of Choluteca.
What brought me to Choluteca – and has led me to many novel experiences – was a sense of curiosity present since my childhood. Growing up, I would constantly ask my parents “why,” quickly followed by “how.” I still strive to understand how the world around me works at both the macro- and micro-level, leading me to pursue biology and psychology. The more I tried to answer my questions, the more new ones arose, and the further enthralled I became. My passion for human connection has always been salient as well, causing me to explore new spaces at an early age, from volunteering at an inner-city elementary school throughout middle and high school, to going on my first service trip to Tobatí, Paraguay, at age fifteen with a school organization. On the trip, a student suffered from heat stroke and was immediately seen by the organization's paramedics. Fortunately, he made a quick recovery, but I wondered what the locals would do during medical emergencies in the remote areas of Tobatí without on-site paramedics or a hospital nearby.
My volunteer experience in Paraguay opened my eyes to the differences in healthcare access around the world, leading me to seek out more opportunities to learn about and help mend this gap. My answer was found in college through Global Medical Brigades, which landed me in Honduras. After a bumpy two-hour bus ride from the capital city, we had arrived in Choluteca, a rural town where healthcare is not easily accessible. I worked diligently in the clinic to assist both patients and local doctors. In my free time, I would play with the children who gathered in the schoolyard. We played pattycake and tag, or “lanza,” as the children called it, using a mixture of Spanish, English, and gestures to overcome the language barrier. However, we did not convene at the elementary school to play games – that was just a bonus. We were there because we shared a common value: equal access to healthcare.
Back at home, I was still drawn to community engagement in medicine, and I began volunteering at Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland. While I was unable to assist doctors in a hands-on way as I did in Honduras, I was able to provide a different resource important to medicine: comfort. Volunteering at the hospital taught me that it is sometimes the little things, such as offering an extra toy car, keeping a patient company at bedside while watching a movie together, or offering a tired parent a coffee break, that truly leave an impact on the patient and their family’s stay. I discovered that there is more to patient care than just treating physical ailments, and seeing the patients smile as their attention moved away from their pain and onto the games we were playing assured me that I am on the correct path.
While my time at the hospital has been incredibly fulfilling, this did not mean that healthcare disparities reminiscent of those I witnessed abroad were not present. One memorable instance was a volunteer experience with a Spanish-speaking mother and daughter. Recalling the Spanish I learned from school as well as from my trips to Honduras and Paraguay, I was able to converse with the family. Despite my broken Spanish, the mother was relieved to have someone to talk to, and her initially shy daughter eventually became comfortable enough to engage in play when she realized that she could enjoy herself without the burden of language confusion. However, she clutched onto her mother when the doctor returned and began delivering important recovery details in English. At the end of the instructions, the doctor and mother exchanged an “Okay,” and the doctor quickly left. Knowing her language abilities, I asked in Spanish if she understood, to which she replied “No.” I translated the doctor's message, but was left unsatisfied as my childhood curiosity prompted me with a myriad of questions. Why was the message delivered in English to a known Spanish-speaker? Why wasn’t the hospital’s translation system used? How have instances like this affected patients’ health outcomes thus far? This experience was a rude awakening to the ways in which marginalized groups are often overlooked in healthcare.
However, rather than harboring negative feelings towards the healthcare system, this experience further invigorated me to pursue a career in medicine. Many minorities and underrepresented groups unfairly have poorer health outcomes due to unequal care, and, as I have seen through my travels, everyone deserves the opportunity of good health – including families like the one I met in Choluteca. Now I have a newfound sense of determination, as my goal is not only to help others, but to use medicine as a gateway for change and equality.","In Design For America (DFA), a student organization that aims to ameliorate community-identified issues, my team worked with our county‚Äôs board of developmental disabilities to create an inclusive events calendar tailored for use by individuals with developmental disabilities (DDs). As DFA champions human-centered design, my team connected with individuals in the DD community through surveys, interviews, and prototype testing. In doing so, we listened to their stories, learned about accessibility challenges, observed their experiences with the product, and integrated their feedback and critiques to improve design. As I modified the initial prototype to prioritize the needs and preferences of individuals in the DD community, I gained insight into how different experiences affect the way we interact with our environments. Empathy, flexibility, and willingness to simply listen to those being served is crucial in providing optimal and equitable outcomes in diverse populations.","While in college, I was a leader in Horizons, a mentorship program that inspires Cleveland high school students, predominantly from minority and low income communities, to explore their medical aspirations. As President, I helped design and facilitate sessions for students to explore medicine, from learning about organ systems through real cadaver organs, to a career fair for healthcare providers to lead hands-on activities in their fields. Other sessions involved seminar-style team-based learning, such as discussing medical case studies. It was rewarding to witness the program triple in size throughout my four years as a member, and to see Horizons instill a passion to pursue future careers in medicine in an increasing number of students. As a person of color, providing equitable care includes combating barriers of entry to increase representation within healthcare, and I was honored to provide high school students in my community with exposure, experience, and support as a mentor.",,,1,,0,0,1

At that time, for my family, the state of our home in New Orleans, Louisiana, was the least of our concerns. ""He's running out of insulin and needs dialysis,"" was what I overheard my grandmother whisper to my Mom in the bathroom. At the age of 6, I was not sure what insulin or dialysis was, but by the look on my Mom's face, I knew my grandfather was in trouble. Over the years, I had helped my grandfather, a type II diabetic, take his medications every morning, prep his insulin shots, and rode in the car as my grandmother brought him to dialysis. However, that morning he had only one pill left, his insulin syringe was only halfway filled, and we didn't go on our morning trip to dialysis. Displaced by the hurricane with limited access to consistent healthcare or medications, his blood sugar levels rose, and his kidney function declined. 
When my family moved back to New Orleans, it was difficult for my grandfather to find a doctor where he could reestablish care. Additionally, resources such as insulin and other medications were scarce. Without adequate care, my grandfather's health worsened. Within months, he lost his eyesight, had both legs amputated, and eventually had triple bypass heart surgery. Internalizing the impact diabetes and the inconsistent access to healthcare had on my grandfather kickstarted my interest in medicine. 
    Years later, I learned that my grandfather's experiences with difficulty accessing medications, dialysis, and healthcare providers were not unique. New Orleans has a predominantly black population, and most of this population suffers from diabetes. Hurricane Katrina exposed the insufficiency of healthcare resource allocation and disproportionately impacted this vulnerable population. This reality inspired me to take an interest in treating these vulnerable populations in hopes of improving the care for our country's underserved communities. 
     Learning about the healthcare barriers in a low socioeconomic city of New Orleans, I developed an interest in exploring the effect of decreased health literacy and access to healthcare on patients' experience with the healthcare system. Exploring this new interest, I started to work as a medical scribe in a medically underserved area. While working in the urgent care one morning, I grabbed my laptop and followed Dr. David as the nurse called from room 3, ""Dr. David, come quickly."" We entered the room where Ms. Ruth had an abscess to her buttocks. She was tachycardic and tachypneic, had a weak pulse, cold, clammy skin, and her blood sugar was 452. ""Call 911. She's in septic shock"". My role in the clinic, when needed, was more than just a scribe. I dropped my computer and helped the nurse gather IV bags, get the EKG machine, and other materials to help prep for the arrival of the ambulance. Dr. David explained that since she had diabetes, she was more inclined to develop an abscess and that the bacteria from the abscess had most likely entered her bloodstream. We followed up on her hospital report later and discovered that Ms. Ruth had passed away in the hospital. I wondered if she had come in sooner, could the spread of the infection have been prevented. Would she still be alive if she had known that she was more predisposed to abscesses? This experience deepened my motivation to understand the role that public health and health education play in the outcome of patients. 
      A few months later, while volunteering at Harbor Grace Hospice, I was responsible for caring for Mr. Clyde, who had stage 4 colon cancer. During our visits, we watched movies, and I assisted him within the scope of my ability. Our relationship grew over the next few weeks of me fluffing his pillow or changing his sheets. Mr. Clyde began to open up to me and share details of his life. He talked about missing his deceased wife, who used to care for him, and his spiritual feelings and struggle with accepting his next phase in life. I listened with an open mind, and we developed a deep connection through our conversations and time together. Our visits were when he could ease his mind and process his thoughts and emotions. Through conversing, he became visibly more at ease with each interaction. This experience solidified my decision to pursue medicine as I saw the importance of empathetic and supportive care and acknowledging patient concerns. As a physician, I will strive to build communication and trust with my patients to make them feel seen and heard.  
     The culmination of my personal and healthcare experiences shaped my decision to be a physician. My journey, beginning with my grandfather, has constantly reminded me of my goal: to minimize healthcare disparities in marginalized and minority groups. I hope to provide care to all regardless of race, culture, or health literacy and lessen the socioeconomic barriers to equitable health. I used to live in fear as diabetes slowly took over my grandfather's life. As a physician, I hope to advocate, heal, and educate my patients through culturally competent care, so they never have to experience that fear.","In college, I took an audiology class in which I learned the alphabet and a few basic phrases in American Sign Language._x000D_
 One week, multiple deaf speakers attended lecture to share their experiences. I spoke with one speaker, Amy, who had a cochlear implant, and I thanked her for being able to share her story. As I said ""share,"" she motioned to the chair beside us. I realized she was lipreading to understand me, and saying ""share"" looked like ""chair."" I then fingerspelled ""share"" to help her. This interaction allowed me to explore a new form of communication and, therefore, better appreciate and understand the unique circumstances of others. I learned how meeting people different from myself is crucial for encountering new cultures and perspectives. _x000D_
	My experience learning about the deaf community has taught me to collaborate with and support diverse groups, a perspective I will share with my classmates at Rush University. ","During my senior year, I started ""Groundskeepers,"" which aimed to promote and educate about social justice on my team and within the Charlottesville community. A week before I moved into my freshman dorm, racially motivated violence took over the grounds of UVA and Charlottesville. ""Groundskeepers"" worked to establish that those events were not representative of Charlottesville and were not tolerated in the community. I helped to organize walks across the city and campus to remember Heather Heyer, who was killed during the violence, and bring awareness to UVA's history of slavery. I led discussions with my team about racial inequality. I also advocated for lacrosse clinics for lower socioeconomic groups in Charlottesville to increase access to lacrosse in these groups and hopefully increase the representation of minority groups in lacrosse. _x000D_

Unfortunately, both opportunities were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since I would not be scribing or doing research, I contacted volunteer organizations looking for ways to get involved, and I began volunteering at Partners for Home in June 2020. On my first day, I grabbed a box of meals and set out to distribute food to homeless individuals in my territory. From there, I developed our COVID-19 education and vaccination program, which helps the homeless population stay up-to-date on variants and the spread of COVID-19 and provides access to the vaccines. I became passionate about providing necessary resources and vaccines and educating these homeless individuals on methods to keep them safe.

The doorknob creaked and her eyes met mine, fraught with concern. My mother trailed behind her and laid a reassuring hand on my shoulder. “Your heart is not doing well,” Dr. Sanders explained gently. “Your body is breaking down the muscle to get the energy it needs.” As if on cue, my heart began to race as I realized that my unassuming GI visit had become an intervention.

In a hospital bed just hours later, I stewed in unease. The diagnosis on my chart felt like a warrant for my arrest, evoking suspicious looks from hospital staff as I ate or used the restroom. I initially resisted treatment, viewing my clinicians as my adversaries. Yet during weekly visits to the eating disorder program, Dr. Sanders treated me with the same genuine respect and compassion she provided adult patients. Her comforting “How are you feeling?” opening each visit was not a pleasantry, but an invitation to unpack the complex emotions I felt. She worked with me to build a meal plan suited to my interests after learning about my distaste for the hospital’s quiche. She inquired about my siblings and my dreams for the future. These subtleties revealed that to her I was more than my case history; first and foremost, I was a human being. With humility, she forged a trusting relationship that encouraged me to commit to recovery and adopt lifelong coping skills. Over a decade after overcoming this challenge, I maintain contact with Dr. Sanders and she is my role model and the type of physician I aspire to be. She treated me with humanity at a time in my life when stigma threatened to define me.

My mind often returns to this moment, especially when I think of my brother. Not everyone is as lucky as I was to have a strong relationship with a provider or attain recovery. Though physicians can work to combat their own internal biases, they cannot always protect patients from stigma outside the bubble of their office. In and out of treatment for substance abuse since early adolescence, my brother bore the burden of stigma around addiction. Relatives questioned the cause of his deviant behavior and sought to punish him for a perceived lack of discipline. Yet ultimately what I saw before me was a child seeking to relieve his burgeoning anxiety. It stung to see others strip him of his humanity the second they labeled him as an addict instead of a person struggling with addiction.

Seeing the vitriol directed at my brother ignited a fire in me to prevent others from experiencing the same injustice. As a mentor for Cayuga Heights Elementary school students, I practiced the skills of listening, and more importantly, cultural humility. Though I could not fully understand the life experiences of the third-grader whose family dealt with poverty and housing instability, I could listen to her story, appreciate her incredible resilience, and learn from her curiosity. As we drew pictures or learned about Earth Day, I recognized that my official role as a mentor was far less important than my implicit role as a trusted adult companion. At Cayuga Medical Center, though I could not relate to the challenges of incarceration, I could treat the young men from the local youth detention facility with respect when they arrived for weekly COVID testing. Each week spent conversing and commiserating about the blistery Ithaca weather taught me that each of them, like my brother, is a human being with a rich background and wisdom to impart. 

I will carry my passion for exploring the intersection of medicine, stigma, and substance use with me into my future clinical research and practice. At Cornell, I work with Dr. Ezell to interview and understand the lived experiences of racial and ethnic minorities who use opioids in rural New York. As a physician, I will continue to advocate for people experiencing addiction and treat them with the dignity they deserve at the bedside. My drive to diminish barriers to care among racial and ethnic minorities also stems from my background–my mother is Puerto Rican, and the distrust of medicine often shared in her culture frequently prevents her from seeking medical care. Through my upbringing and research, I have gained empathy for those who distrust Western medicine. With mutual communication and honesty, I will provide all patients with the excellent care they deserve.
Combining my passions for health equity, addiction recovery advocacy, and pediatric care, I want to go to medical school to build a strong foundation in patient-centered healthcare upon which I can forge relationships with patients as Dr. Sanders did with me. Leveraging my social capital as a physician, I will help all patients, especially those from vulnerable and underserved populations, enjoy better health. Stigma prevents many people from receiving quality healthcare and young patients from having honest communication with their healthcare team. With the knowledge of the human body and the privilege of leadership I will have as a physician, I can better advocate for patients and work alongside them to navigate their health concerns.","Raised by a Puerto Rican mother with a commitment to familismo, familial interdependence, I am sensitive to cultural differences that impact healthcare access. My grandmother, valuing time with her children over what she viewed as an impersonal healthcare environment, spent her final months with leukemia at home instead of receiving care. Similarly, my mother often delays medical care to care for her children and prefers to make collective medical decisions. My experiences have revealed that unilateral healthcare decision-making can often cause undue suffering. Understanding the complexity of values surrounding healthcare, particularly among minorities, affords me a unique perspective that allows me to practice shared decision-making to honor patients‚Äô values. Today, driven to reduce health disparities, I conduct research about opioid use among racial/ethnic minorities in rural NY, gaining an invaluable population health perspective that contextualizes my clinical interactions.","At the start of the pandemic, I was unsettled by the inequitable access to COVID-19 testing. Living in Ithaca, where nearly 40 percent of residents live below the poverty line and many are unhoused, I was especially troubled by this disparity, recognizing the increased chance of community spread in Ithaca‚Äôs unhoused encampments. I began working at Cayuga Medical Center‚Äôs site to provide city-subsidized testing to everyone regardless of insurance status._x000D_

Though the testing site was a drive-through location, many patients arrived by foot. Thus, my coworkers and I devised a workflow that allowed one of us to serve these patients while others continued to assist patients in vehicles. Without adjusting our care delivery, testing would have been limited to those who could afford a vehicle or taxi service. I have learned that small adjustments, accomplished through self-reflection and humility, can significantly improve the inclusivity of healthcare. ",,,1,,1,0,2

I surveyed the big parking lot, searching for my targets. I was doing my usual volunteer task at the Cleveland Clinic: collecting wheelchairs that patients left when discharged from the hospital. Yet that day, I noticed an elderly woman standing by herself, in the corner of the parking lot, holding onto an IV pole, and she seemed lost. When I asked if she needed any help, she tried to speak, but words didn't come out; instead her plaintive voice turned into a low mumble. Suddenly, grabbing my arm tightly, she looked me in the eye. At that moment, I knew that, bewildered and distressed, she required immediate attention. Holding my arm up to support the woman, I called my supervisor, who quickly arrived with the EMS crew to escort the woman to the ER. Later, telling me that the woman had experienced acute chest pain when she had left the hospital, my supervisor commended my timely discovery and reaction, so that the woman did not have any significant aftereffects. Thanks to those words of praise, though only a volunteer who carried out a minor duty, I viewed myself as an essential part of a team that responded to and relieved the pain and suffering of a helpless patient with care, promptness, and efficacy.
My volunteering experiences motivated me to seek a better understanding of patient care and encouraged me to become more involved in the medical field. As I shadowed Dr. Chiang in the Sleep Medicine Clinic of the University Hospital, I discovered that being a physician entails far more than prescribing drugs and providing treatment. One day, we saw a follow-up visiting patient for sleep apnea and sleepiness during the day. The patient explained that the prescribed CPAP machine was not working and requested Provigil, a drug to treat excessive sleepiness but with serious side effects. The data from the CPAP machine, however, showed that the patient's sleep apnea was well under control. Dr. Chiang asked if I understood this confusing situation; and when I considered it from the patient's perspective, suddenly everything became clear to me. For a truck driver, sleepiness during the day would hurt his performance and result in decreased safety, which might cause the patient to lose his job, and thus the patient wanted Provigil to remove his sleepiness quickly. Dr. Chiang explained to the patient that Provigil could lead to sleep insomnia, which would worsen his sleeping, and reassured him that the CPAP machine treated his sleep apnea effectively so that he would feel much more energetic and would not lose his job. The patient expressed gratitude both for the medical care that he had received and for the empathetic concern with which it had been delivered. Witnessing Dr. Chiang's impact on the patient, I realized the importance of building connections with patients through an understanding of and regard for their individual thoughts, worries, and circumstances.
My effort to comprehend the methods and conditions that make for effective patient care not only involves direct interaction with patients but also sparks my interest in translational research. Dr. Monnier's research on drug development for age-related cataract caught my attention. My grandmother suffers from this infirmity, but the only treatment has been surgery, which is too risky for someone her age. I joined Dr. Monnier's lab to develop drugs to cure age-related cataract in elderly patients like my grandmother. I started by learning everything from scratch and working on the research project with no postdocs to follow, because Dr. Monnier hoped I could think as a researcher instead of blindly following him. From reading papers, designing experiments, communicating with lab colleagues, and presenting results in lab meetings, I discovered how to behave as a professional researcher. I would spend days reading papers to create the most promising research sets and nights in the lab removing lenses from the eyes of mice and culturing them. Then I would devote an equal amount of time and scrutiny to revise and restructure the experiments when they failed. Yet it was these repetitive procedures that led to discoveries and progress in the project. The iterative process that characterizes rigorous and effective research, I learned, is essential to advancements in the treatment of disease and improved patient care.
As I have continued on my path toward medicine, I have often reminded myself of the people I saw, served, and helped – the lonely woman in the parking lot, the truck driver fearful of losing his job, and the elderly patients plagued by age-related cataract. Like most patients, they were ordinary people who encountered a health crisis and thus required attention, an understating of their circumstances, and skilled care. Solicitude for individual patients in need is what motivates me to pursue medicine. I want to connect with, tend to, and advocate for people like them as a future physician.","I participated in the TRIO program where I shared my road to college and advised on building a college application for Cleveland local high school students. During the Q&A session, I noticed that some students were more interested in tuition and financial aid, while I focused on professional development when I was applying. One of them shared that she had brothers and sisters to take care of. Thus, she preferred a college nearby with abundant work-study programs. Another disclosed that since his family did not support him attend college, tuition and financial aids would determine whether he could pay for college himself. Listening to their stories, I realized I had given suggestions from my perspectives. I was grateful that the students entrusted me with their private matters and help me understand their backgrounds. Now, I could offer advice to meet their actual needs. From the experience, I learned to think in other‚Äôs shoes, listen to their needs before I offer advice and help.","As an Orientation Leader, I once led a group activity to decide whether statements associated with sexual violence and misconduct were a myth or fact. One statement said that if someone dressed provocatively or walked alone, they were responsible for unwanted sexual advances. One group member claimed that because someone chose to perform risky behaviors, they were responsible for the consequences._x000D_
I stood up to address the issue. I explained to the group that victim-blaming attitudes encourage rape culture and sexual violence. By blaming the victim, we alienated the victims and normalized sexual misconduct and abusers‚Äô actions. I encouraged the group to take action when facing discrimination like this. _x000D_
After the event, I reached out to the group member privately. He admitted that he overlooked the issue and came to understand the importance of combating victim-blaming. I‚Äôm glad that I changed his thought and promoted inclusiveness among the group._x000D_
",,,1,"All the hospitals nearby closed their volunteer programs during the pandemic. I lost the chance to gain more experience and was unable to support the patients and my fellow healthcare workers during this difficult time. Yet I was grateful to continue my education with support from my family. Thus, I determined to find other ways to support those who were more affected. I joined the Physical Resource Center, a store created to offer free essentials to our hard-hit neighbors in the pandemic. I became the co-personnel manager to solve the issue of shortage in volunteers. In addition, I reached out to our faculty advisor to initiate connections with local organizations to increase our visibility and offer our resources to more people who were in need. We delivered essentials, including food, sanitation supplies, clothes, and furniture to the greater Cleveland community.

Before settling in San Antonio, Texas, we lived in New York, Michigan, Colorado, Minnesota, and Canada. I never fully understood that every move was necessary for my father to further his medical career. Being a foreign medical graduate, he was required to repeat a decade of medical training to be able to practice in the US. Every year throughout elementary and middle school, I found myself at a new school in a new state, always managing to make new friends within a few days. While some may attribute our numerous moves as a lack of stability, I embraced them as lessons on flexibility. I learned to connect with people quickly and adjust to new environments. My parents recognized this adaptability, making them feel comfortable with my decision to graduate high school early and move out for college at 16. Alone, I moved from Texas to Ohio, where I spent a year earning my associate degree before transferring to The Ohio State University.

 Being born and raised in America while living in a Muslim Egyptian household, I lived in what felt like two completely different worlds.  From my parents, I learned what it's like to grow up in an impoverished village in Egypt. From my peers, I’d learned about Christmas, and Halloween- festivities I wasn’t able to partake in because it wasn’t a part of my culture. I felt conflicted between my household eastern values and the western values I absorbed from the world around me. It wasn’t until high school that I started to understand my identity as a first generation American, that I have the privilege of benefitting from the richness of various cultures.

My high school class consisted of around 100 students with unique, diverse backgrounds, including Asians, Europeans, Latinos, and others. Socializing with such a heterogeneous group encouraged me to embrace my roots and come to terms with my Egyptian-American identity. It was through my friends that I was able to learn about many different cultures and traditions. This exposure broadened my perspective, helping me better connect and relate with people less familiar with American culture throughout college.

 Our capacity to understand one another's point of view is crucial in our ability to connect with each other. I have seen loved ones suffer from addiction, as well as mental and physical health issues. I have witnessed how people can struggle within unfortunate circumstances, and I acknowledge that these are universal human problems. Being close to these issues helps me truly understand and empathize with other people’s hardships. The study of medicine is the study of these struggles. Physicians study the human body and mind in order to ease the struggles of our fellow humans, and I can’t think of a field more deserving of my resources.

Throughout much of grade school, whenever I saw one of my classmates struggling with a concept that I mastered, I’d jump at the opportunity to explain it to them using an alternative method. Seeing a wave of clarity wash across a friend’s face as I explained a concept to them was fulfilling, which is why volunteering as a tutor was one of the most rewarding experiences I've done. I was seventeen years old in my second year of college, working with a community center for refugees, teaching high school students, not much younger than me, science and math. Whenever I helped a student think in a different way in order to better comprehend a problem or concept, I was always reminded of the fulfillment that came along with watching the gears turn in their head. I was proud of myself for helping someone overcome their struggle, and of the student for caring enough to learn.

Growing up, I lived at my father’s fertility clinic. I observed and performed back-office operations necessary for quality patient care. It was inspiring to see a newfound ease sweep across a patient’s face when my father simplified the complex science behind their medical issues. While medical students did rotations with him, I'd join their discussions to learn alongside them. The natural comfort and curiosity I felt in these discussions reassured me that I'd be interested in the content I will be studying in medical school and beyond.

Regardless of what city we were jumping into, I’ve been surrounded by medicine from an early age. However, it wasn’t until my last year of college that I realized I was on this path for the wrong reasons. Although I enjoyed the medical related content in my classes, ultimately I planned on being a doctor because it was what I’ve been pushed toward. When I came face to face with this realization, it made me contemplate my choices. The lessons we internalize from our life experiences are what shape who we are. After reflecting on my past, and pondering the future, it registered that my desire to be a physician doesn’t stem from others' expectations of me, but rather it is rooted in my core values. I feel an electric excitement at the prospect of knowing the inner workings of the human body, and being able to utilize this knowledge to positively impact those around me, whether that impact is treating patients, teaching others, or inspiring someone to be better.","_x000D_
I was visiting Texas one summer, and I had a long uber drive with a friendly, talkative driver. He was an older white man in his 60‚Äôs, without much formal education. After getting to know each other better, he brought up some conspiracy theories he believed in. I initially thought he was just a crazy old man, but I inquired about his beliefs and heard him out, realizing that his ill-informed beliefs stemmed from a lack of education. He was suspicious of the COVID pandemic because if you look at lysol from decades ago, it would mention coronavirus on the packaging. I realized that he didn‚Äôt know that coronavirus is a family, not a specific disease. My background in medicine and biology made this fact obvious to me, but how could someone without the proper scientific knowledge have known? This encounter encouraged me to reflect on how my privileged background affects my perspective, and stay conscious of how other‚Äôs unique life experiences result in their point of view. _x000D_
","I was 17 years old during my second year at Ohio State University when I joined the Students for Refugees club, where I was able to connect with a local community center and started tutoring highschool students. This center provided tutoring services for students of all ages, who were mostly children of African immigrants. Being not much older than them, and also the son of muslim immigrants, I was able to relate to many of them closely, making them feel more comfortable and willing to listen and work with me. Through this experience, I realized that the best way to teach material is to understand how a student thinks, and then deliver the content in a way that is compatible with the student‚Äôs thought process. In order to effectively teach my students, I had to understand them. Whenever I was successfully able to teach a student how to think meta-cognitively about their studies, I would see them become more self-confident in their ability to learn. ",,,1,"Adjusting to COVID was a rough transition, as staying home daily hindered opportunity to connect with my peers and professors. Many students fell behind due to virtual learning, and while I did not feel I was obtaining the same quality education and experience, I was stayed consistent by keeping myself on an organized schedule so I wouldn‚Äôt fall behind my classes.  During this time, I kept my social life from wavering by connecting with old friends and new classmates via group chat apps and gaming. COVID also made my tutoring program switch to virtual sessions, which felt less personal, and more difficult to teach and connect with our students. It was also difficult to know where to find safe, impactful opportunities, especially when COVID initially struck and there was little known about its severity and infectivity.. During this time, I started to practice yoga and meditation by watching videos and reading online, and I found that this greatly helped my mental and physical health",1,0,1

I began to work in high school to help out, and my work obligations took up much of my time which led to my grades slipping. Although my education was very important to me, I found it difficult to balance my responsibilities to help out financially, with my academic work. While applying to college, I knew that many of the opportunities and experiences would not be available to me if I had to continue working as much to fund my education. As a result, I applied to as many scholarships as I could find, and was fortunate to receive enough funding to cover my costs. While I no longer had to work, I had to still help out my mom with picking up/dropping off and babysitting my younger sister while I did my coursework. I had to dedicate a lot of time to this, but I was able to use my previous experiences with my job to work on my time management.

Looking my tia in her eyes, I gently squeeze her hand, as the once silent room erupts in agonized protest. 

My tia was born with a congenital heart defect that required her to undergo multiple open-heart surgeries. Every time she had to go to the hospital, our worry about her health was compounded by the reality that she did not have healthcare. The irony of my sick tia asking us not to worry about her health was overshadowed by the reality that we did have to worry, since we were limited in finding her the best care because of her lack of healthcare coverage. 

My experience with my tia drove me to work with other underprivileged Latino individuals, so I joined Consejo. As part of the Consejo team, I worked intimately with individuals suffering from Substance-Use Disorders and Mental Health illnesses. I met “Jane” who was a young, single mother struggling with addiction. As I formed a deeper connection with Jane, she told me about her lack of healthcare coverage, which greatly affected her chemical dependency treatment program options. She shared with me how this led to difficulty for her to find accessible jobs in her own city, so that she could begin to regain custody of her children. Realizing this lack of resource for our clients to re-integrate after court-ordered treatment programs, I created the official youth resources brochure for our organization that outlines opportunities to get involved in the community. Working closely with Jane led me to realize my passion for having a more direct role in patient care, and work closely with patients. 

Interested in continuing my work with individuals from my own community and other underserved populations, I shadowed at the newly formed Latinx Diabetes Institute to gain a further understanding of the role and responsibilities of a doctor. While shadowing Dr. Alarcon-Casas Wright, I witnessed many Latinx diabetes patients who required further education on their condition. One particular Latina patient mentioned that while her diabetes education classes were informative, much of the advice was impractical for her. Interested, I asked her to elaborate on what that meant. She pointed out to me that she couldn’t afford to buy many of the foods she was advised to eat, and had only heard about certain foods for the first time at a nutrition class.  

After meeting with the patient, Dr. Alarcon-Casas Wright further informed me about the prevalence of diabetes in the Latinx population, and pointed me towards papers and articles that I read to further my understanding. This experience made me realize the importance of culturally informed physicians and treatment plans, and inspired me to continue my work with these more marginalized populations that did not have access to as many medical resources due to their cultural and socioeconomic background. While shadowing Dr. Alarcon-Casas Wright and reading further about diabetes advances, my appreciation for medical research began to grow. 

Since my tia had many health issues associated with her congenital heart disease, I spent many hours with her,  pouring over scientific articles detailing the future of medical advances in cardiology and constantly letting her know about anything new I had read. My interest in these scientific advances in medical treatments grew as I spent more time researching my tia’s own medical issues. With a passion for research, and advancing our knowledge of diseases and treatment, I joined a research lab studying debilitating retinal degenerative diseases such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration, which is present in my family. While working in the lab, I developed my perseverance and tenacity as I analyzed papers and extracted critical information, constantly looking for more to learn, and growing as an independent and critical thinker. Based on the papers I read, I independently designed a project aimed at further characterizing the complement system in retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE). From my results, I continued to develop and expand my project, and received fellowships that funded my work. Working on my research project allowed me to recognize and appreciate the ever-evolving nature of medicine. 

In my career, I aspire to continue working to advance the field of medicine, contributing to novel treatments, and providing culturally informed care directly to patients. Becoming a physician allows me to combine my passions perfectly: to be an instrument of change through advocacy, research, and direct care. My passion for medicine stems from a desire to work closely with underserved populations, and provide essential healthcare services. While healthcare coverage was something my family had to worry about, I am driven to become a physician that provides care to all, regardless of gender, socioeconomic, or cultural identification, and serve as a change-maker to ensure everyone has access to the best quality care.

My journey has prepared me and solidified my passion for a career in medicine, and given me the opportunity to have unique experiences that inform my role as a compassionate carer. Therefore, I strive to become a physician practicing with complete dedication, providing the best care possible as a scientist, leader, and caretaker.","At Consejo, I work closely with youth clients that have a substance-use disorder that come from very diverse backgrounds. One client I worked with was a young Native American female who was a single-parent. As I did not share a similar background, I found it more difficult to give her specific information about opportunities. As a result, I asked for permission to sit-in on a treatment session to gain a better insight into her interests and struggles. This led to me gaining a greater understanding of her background and experiences, and I was able to help connect her with resources. This experience enhanced my ability to understand those from different backgrounds by emphasizing the importance of a growth mindset. I learned that to empathize with the client, I had to actively listen and acknowledge her journey and perspective. I also learned about the importance of thorough care for each individual, in the context of their background and experiences.","As a volunteer with the youth program in Consejo, I met a young adult who struggled heavily with substance-use disorders, who shared with me his identification with the LGBTQ community. Indicating that he was unable to share this part of his identity with his family, this frustration often manifested in behavioral issues, and increased substance use. Although I personally lacked the training to help this client most efficiently, and our organization did not have resources for LGBTQ, I set out to contact organizations in the area that worked with LGBTQ youth, serving as an advocate for this client. Working closely with him, I helped him navigate the resources and find a support system that fit all his needs. To prevent such a challenge in the future while helping LGBTQ clients, I reached out to local organizations and streamlined our services so we would work collaboratively. In my role as an advocate for one individual, I was able to better our resources for a community. ",,,1,,0,0,2

Over the past few years, my mom could not complete daily tasks without constantly feeling bouts of pain. A week earlier, she went in for a routine biannual angiogram, due to her lupus, but instead was admitted into the hospital for a triple bypass surgery. As the oldest child, I had to suppress my fear of losing my mom to stay levelheaded enough to console my 12-year-old sister and be someone my dad can rely on.

I was thankful to join my mom despite the hospital’s COVID visitor policy because it would have pained me to see her go through such a daunting experience alone as others, including my grandpa, did. I felt a sense of purpose and joy in seeing that simple gestures, like carrying her belongings or listening to her worries, comforted her.

The nurse took my mom to a cold, empty pre-operative room. I sat on a chair by my mom’s bed and held her hands, comforting her with my presence. She made me promise that if anything happened to her, I would make sure that my dad and sister both live well. The weight of that statement was heavy, but I assured her that I would do my best and smiled.

After five long hours, I got a call saying that my mom was out of surgery. A sense of relief washed over me, and I rushed to see her. She looked pale and exhausted and had tubes lodged in her throat and up her nose. None of that mattered because my mom was still alive. Witnessing the pain she felt before surgery and recognizing the loss that my family would have experienced if she had not received medical attention, I decided to become a doctor to ensure that others also have access to care.

Although my mom’s surgery influenced my decision to become a doctor, my appreciation for medicine existed for as long as I can remember. I became in charge of my parents' medications at a young age. I would organize their pills by color and size and toss them into their mouths, not knowing why or how they worked, nor understanding the responsibility I had at the time. All I knew was that they made my parents feel better. 

When I was six, my mom had a miscarriage. After sitting in on most of her appointments, I was devastated to hear that my unborn sister “had gone to a better place.” This experience made me abhor the idea of sickness and determined to fight it. Despite this, my mom’s doctor made us feel cared for. She held my mom’s hand and cried while delivering the news as if my sister was her own. I sensed the care and dedication this doctor put into her work and admired her for it. 

Shortly after, my mom got pregnant again. Thankfully, she was seen by a medical team that utilized the latest technology to help my mom give birth to my sister. I realized how fortunate we were to have access to care but also recognized that many others do not.

The moment I got the chance, I started volunteering at hospitals in the heart of Los Angeles to both learn more about medicine and give back. I got the opportunity to witness medical care during the pandemic. I saw illnesses that tormented patients and claimed people’s lives, especially during COVID. While completing simple tasks, like distributing water, joining rounds, or voicing patients’ concerns, I also saw how the medical team tirelessly collaborates to aid patients.

I was later selected to be an intern at a hospital. I remember calling a Spanish-speaking patient to confirm her appointment and realizing that nobody at the clinic knew enough Spanish to relay the message to her. I reached for a pen and paper and quickly wrote a script. Later, one of the nurses taped my script to the computer, so other staff members could utilize it in the future. Through this, I learned the importance of tailoring medical services to individual needs in order to make care accessible to people from different backgrounds, including non-English speakers of my own community.

This encounter emphasized that medicine is a profession built upon service. I realized that this patient, like many others, does not have access to basic resources, like medical care being readily available in the language she is most comfortable with. This motivated me to seek out ways to work with underserved communities to minimize the effects of existing language barriers. I became a peer-learning facilitator, providing academic support to students from underserved communities. I also mentored and provided free college-prep services to underprivileged Coptic students through the Coptic Education Foundation. These experiences not only allowed me to serve but to learn. I met a variety of people, who persisted through circumstances much more challenging than my own, inspiring me to remain resilient and optimistic unconditionally.

Although my initial perception of medicine as a child was naive, the experiences I have had, both circumstantially and voluntarily, have reinforced my passion for medicine. I want to serve people and improve their lives despite the odds stacked against them. I do not have the solution to every problem, but I am confident that with sincerity, determination, and compassion, one can provide quality care to others, regardless of who they are, and leave an impact on their lives.","As an EMT, I transported an elderly hospice patient who wanted to spend his last days at home. Upon arrival at his home, I saw that about ten people shared the space and that our patient‚Äôs bedroom barely fit the gurney.

I explained to her the instructions and waved goodbye as we walked out._x000D_

The fact that so many people shared the same space with our patient and that his wife did not know how to read demonstrates that there are societal issues, including health literacy, inadequate housing, and socioeconomic disparities, to be addressed in order to truly improve the quality of life of people from vulnerable backgrounds. Although I did not experience some of these circumstances, I empathized with our patient and became committed to addressing the educational and financial disparities that affect many members of our society since then.","Pursuing higher education is a challenge for immigrants and students from low-income backgrounds.

These are the maternal figures who strengthened my ties to womanhood, the core of my earliest exposures to healthcare. Through their journeys, I experienced the fluctuating nature of medicine, whether it be relief in hearing my brother’s beating heart during Mama’s ultrasound, fear of a suspicious mass found in Phupu’s mammogram, or helplessness while watching Dada struggle to explain her arthritis pain in broken English. Although I was too young in these moments to resolve my mothers’ anxieties, the physicians managing their conditions could. They supported our family during times of grief and joy. Inspired by their comprehensive approach to address all aspects of my mothers’ medical concerns, I realized I also wanted to be a physician, providing holistic and personalized care to my patients and leveraging my own experiences as a woman to address any barriers they may face in accessing healthcare.

In college, I worked with an NGO, Paani, to distribute clean water to families in Pakistan. Although Paani’s focus was ensuring access to clean water in these villages, I was captivated by the struggles of their young women. A community of physicians were behind my mothers, but in Sindh, the lack of healthcare systems compounded with cultural and physical barriers compromised women’s health. I remember viscerally reacting as Uzma, a first-time mother, described using a damp cloth as a pad. Old biology lectures consumed me as I became fearful of her increased risk for vaginal infections. Uzma’s location impeded her access to alternative products and the social stigmas against menstruation also restricted Sindhi women like herself to more archaic practices. Even though Uzma and I were born in fundamentally different environments, the same South Asian stigmas governed me as well, prohibiting me from using tampons to preserve my hymen’s integrity. I realized I wanted to serve women in these Sindhi communities, not only because of our shared identity but a shared understanding of our struggle.

I quickly pushed Paani to expand their efforts to include women’s health, spearheading an initiative that paired each built well with feminine hygiene product distributions and an educational workshop detailing how to properly use those products. I remember calling into our first class and suddenly seeing my screen filled with women of all ages, eager to understand their own role in their health. This moment opened my eyes to the gap that existed in women’s health across the world, whether in the rural communities of Sindh or within the American healthcare system. I understood how vital it was for patients to be in control of their health and have someone understand their personal or religious choices when providing healthcare.

However, the more I worked to implement women-specific initiatives for Paani, the more I learned that the preventative measures I was creating were imperfect. No matter how many hygiene kits were provided, women were not immune to becoming sick. I met Asma, a young girl from Sindh, in pain and at risk for sepsis due to her untreated UTI. Unable to help, I realized that I didn’t want my aspirations in healthcare to stop at preventative measures—I desired the medical knowledge of a physician to provide care when those resources fell short.

With the struggle of patients like Asma ingrained in me, I sought out physicians who could guide me to become the doctor that I intended to be. Under the mentorship of Dr. Tasneem Bader, I watched her apply her medical expertise and foster strong relationships with all of her patients, a facet I hope to also implement when guiding treatment in my own practice. It was when a new patient, Hajra, came in for a routine physical, that I got to see how medicine involved not only the science of diseases but also the trauma underlying them. Hajra’s pap smear indicated mild dysplasia, not cancerous, but with the potential to be. In the weeks I spent finding her an OBGYN, I tried to place myself in her shoes, unable to imagine her fear of not being able to start a family. Fortunately, her pathology report did not indicate cancer, but as a woman with similar life goals, my heart ached for those who may not have been as lucky as she was.

It was through observing experiences beyond those of my family, whether Hajra’s or the women in Sindh, that I garnered a deep appreciation and respect for women’s health. To me, women’s health encompasses not only the physiology of women’s bodies, but also the emotional support I can provide to patients both in times of difficulties and joy. As a doctor, I want to improve patient outcomes in my community, a need that cannot be fulfilled solely through preventative resources. As I continue learning about social and biological aspects of medicine, I want to provide compassionate and personalized care to my patients, using my unique position as a physician to lessen the impact of systemic inequities that they may experience. The foundation of every family is rooted in the strength of their women. I hope that through my care I can nurture these roots and, in turn, advance the health of my community.","Ted had been under Dr. Omarali‚Äôs care for 15 years, always recounting stories of his youth whenever he visited. On this day, Ted was extremely upset: a pharmacist at CVS offered him an additional booster against COVID-19. Ted voiced his firm opposition against vaccines to me, convinced that the first ‚Äújab‚Äù he received was the cause of his current condition._x000D_

While I consider vaccinations to be important, in this instance I set aside my own beliefs and continued taking Ted‚Äôs vitals as normal. I sympathized with his frustrations and encouraged him to speak with Dr. Omarali about his concerns. Ted ultimately chose not to, but the experience taught me the importance of respecting patient autonomy. As a physician, I can better educate my patients, but I must also develop a personalized care plan that is sensitive to their sociocultural circumstances and individual choices. Irrespective of Ted‚Äôs beliefs, it was my responsibility to treat him with compassion and kindness while providing care.","When I first joined the nonprofit Paani, I learned of Haru, a young boy who died from diarrhea, a treatable illness that turned fatal due to a lack of healthcare access. Haru‚Äôs story was common, as more than half of his rural district of Sindh, Pakistan walked 2 miles every day to reach a contaminated water supply. Inspired by Haru, I ran a bake sale on campus, where I sold cupcakes to fundraise for a water well and raise awareness for health disparities that continued to affect Haru‚Äôs village. Not only did I get to see the culmination of small acts of service, but I was also able to educate my peers about the community needs of underserved villages, inspiring them to get involved in Paani. Today, Haru‚Äôs village has a deep water well, with a plaque in his name. The legacy of Haru motivated me to expand my efforts within Paani. So far, our team has built over 4500 water systems to alleviate water scarcity and increase access to clean water in Pakistan, a number we continue to grow daily",,,1,"Imminent travel bans and our abrupt transition to a virtual semester caused me to abandon my Ann Arbor apartment overnight and move back to California.

As I have grown older, my problem-solving abilities have developed and refined, providing me the insight to see there is often more than one  path to arrive at a given solution. As I began to ask more questions, I came to understand that some problems needed to be solved through trial-and-error rather than the stepwise processes I had previously relied on. 
Early on, pursuing a career in medicine made sense based on my interests in STEM as well as my desire to ask questions, find answers, and solve problems; but I never truly understood why I was drawn to the field. It was not until I began working full-time as a scribe in a busy emergency room that I began to discover the answer to this question. Through medical decision making, I observed how physicians systematically ruled out possible diagnoses, while using the fundamentals of science.  I saw science “come to life” as it was applied to improve the wellbeing of those in need.
However, it was through human connection with patients that I saw a new side of medicine, one in which scientific reasoning was not as useful.  Each day showed me how a simple conversation and taking the time to become acquainted with the patient was a central puzzle piece to finding a diagnosis.  Many of the patients who frequented our ER were from the severely underserved area south of Chicago and faced unmet healthcare needs and systemic disadvantage. For many patients, the ER was their only access to healthcare, so physicians trained in emergency medicine were tasked with treating both acute and traumatic issues. Despite a full waiting room most days, these dedicated physicians showed up to the ER and provided each patient with a high level of care and compassion.
As a scribe, I was exposed to a wide variety of cases and patients ranging from as young as a few days old to over 100 years old. While some people received relieving news, others’ lives change in an instant due to bad outcomes and unforeseen diagnoses.  Immersed in daily learning experiences, I noticed how quickly physicians had to think on their feet and evaluate what needed to be done to help the patient. While every procedure was fascinating, my biggest take away was how the physician’s duty to provide support and compassion was as important as their duty to treat the illness. 
The first case of my very first day as a scribe was a pediatric sexual assault, also known as a Code R.  I had recently passed floor training and was nervous to chart on my own. Prior to that day, I had never experienced a Code R chart. Luckily, I had trained with Dr. Azam a couple times, so I was familiar with his charting preferences. Due to the sensitivity of the case, I was unsure if I should even accompany Dr. Azam into the patient’s room, but he eased my uncertainty by getting the patient’s permission. He instructed me to leave my laptop outside the room and focus on remembering the pertinent details for the chart to help the examination room feel “warmer.”  Like many days, the ER was packed so there was little time to spare. However, when Dr. Azam walked into that room, there was no indication that we were pressed for time. Dr. Azam decided to take his white coat and stethoscope off and grabbed an extra chair for himself and for the patient’s mother. 
As I stood in the corner of the room, I was impressed with Dr. Azam’s personable manner.  Through the heartbreaking details of the case, he navigated the conversation with tact and composure. Dr. Azam ensured that the patient and her mother understood every medical option available, but he did not stop there. The compassion Dr. Azam displayed to this young girl, during arguably one of her hardest days, was aspirational. After leaving the room, Dr. Azam suggested that we take a walk to decompress after the heavy conversation. As we were walking, he said that Code R cases would never get easier and that sometimes bad days would outweigh the days that “being a doctor feels like being a superhero.” He then proceeded to say, “there will always be time for the medicine. Don’t overlook the patient sitting in front of you because you got lost in the medicine.” 
In the grand scheme of things, it is probably unlikely that Dr. Azam will remember the details of that case. However, for the patient, for her mother, and for me, that day will never be forgotten. They will most likely remember how the physician listened and sympathized with them during one of their hardest moments.  For me, however, I will never forget Dr. Azam’s advice. He made me see what it means to treat the person, rather than the patient or the illness.  Medically, this was not the most “interesting” case or even a case for which I was prepared. However, this case demonstrated that patient care is far more than medicine and “cracking the code.” While my initial interest in solving problems drew me to medicine, it is the people and their stories that are the reason I want to become a physician. My hope is that I can be an advocate and a person of support during a moment in my patients' lives.","Working as an RA during college, I had the opportunity to learn from students with whom I did not share a similar background. Through interactions with my residents, I found out more about each of them, as well as more about myself. For example, I had an international student who was dealing with homesickness as this was their first time away from their family. Although I could not relate directly to the international student experience, I was able to find common ground as we discussed our families, some of our traditions, and the ways that we try to keep in touch when we are far away from our loved ones. My time as an RA also provided me with a lot of lessons on how to be sensitive to differences in culture, especially when dealing with roommate/hallmate conflicts. Ultimately, I found that simply listening to my residents was always the best approach, and entering each interaction without any preconceived notions resulted in the best outcomes and learning opportunities.","Working as a Learning Assistant (LA) for Introductory Biology and Biochemistry during the pandemic was foundational as it provided me with opportunities to create community during an unprecedented time and foster a culture of support. I created a safe space for my students to collaborate, synthesize information, and think critically. Unlike a TA, I was not responsible for assessing students‚Äô performance, so I related to their struggles, advocated on their behalf, and provided them with an example of resilience in STEM. For example, I shared my experience of having to retake Intro Biology after an unsatisfactory course grade and withdrawing from Biochemistry due to the switch to asynchronous classes, but despite that, I was still recommended by professors to serve as an LA because of my tenacity. Furthermore, my identity as a Black Woman inspired other students and continued to challenge an existing narrative that excludes certain identities from thriving in science or as leaders. ",,,1,"During my junior year of undergrad, I made the critical decision to take a gap year following my upcoming graduation.  Following the disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic, I felt that I would not be the strongest candidate had I chosen to apply with my limited shadowing, volunteering, and clinical experience. I also chose to take additional, focused time studying for the MCAT to strengthen my application. While COVID-19 changed the way that I lived and learned during the remainder of my undergraduate experience, it also gave me time to mature as a student and person during truly unprecedented times.

As early as middle school, my peers seemed to know exactly what they wanted to pursue. My sister also committed to becoming a doctor when she was only in high school. At first, I thought I was lacking the passion or fire inside myself that would make me so committed to any goal. I felt this way throughout high school and college. I wish I could say I’ve known my whole life that I was destined for this path, but that would be a lie. It is only after years of consideration and thoughtful analysis that I realized that becoming a doctor was what I truly wanted to do. Exploring different fields throughout this journey is what helped me discover my destined path. My current resolve to become a physician stems from the collection of my past experiences, some related to healthcare and some not. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough space here to delve deep into each of these, so I chose some key experiences to highlight.
 
At age 11, my visit with my grandparents in Punjab, India reshaped my world. My grandmother is a physician who established medical care in impoverished villages that had no toilets or electricity. That trip, a team of doctors, interns, and I, under makeshift tents, served lines of villagers who traveled miles for medical care. Although I didn’t realize it at the time, the compassion I had for these people, and the feelings of euphoria through serving, was something I would chase for years in my experiences at home.
 
From ages 3 to 17, I danced at a professional company. I noticed a high turnover of students who couldn’t afford classes. This led me to become the sole proprietor of “Dance Away” at age 14. The purpose of my company was to give low-income children the same opportunities I had, by providing classes, 3 times a week, at $3 an hour, sometimes for free. Soon I had 30 clients, and by age 15, I was running a full business. I enrolled at UC Berkeley so I could stay local and continue these classes.
 
Balancing schoolwork, dancing, and Dance Away proved challenging and rewarding, though not the same euphoria I felt in India. I volunteered at a pregnancy clinic in an impoverished area of SF. I witnessed women come in physically and mentally defeated, but leave empowered. Witnessing this change was an incredible, first clinical experience that solidified my desire to help people.
 
At Berkeley, I co-founded “Invention Corps,” which used design thinking to tackle economic, social, environmental and health issues, locally and abroad. I headed our first project, Hygiene Heroes, which focused on improving sanitary conditions in Tamil Nadu, India, where over 37,000 schools are located. Open defecation was a major cause of disease because of unusable, unsanitary toilets. We built a website for students to identify restrooms that met minimum sanitary conditions. Schools that didn’t meet minimum standards were pressured to enforce repairing of their toilets. I also oversaw another project, called Visualize Ghana. Women in Ghana were dying of cervical cancer because few hospitals could afford the device used to detect the disease. We created an inexpensive digital prototype of a device that is still used in Ghanaian hospitals today. Serving people globally was so fulfilling.
 
Until then, I only planned on receiving a degree in Public Health, so I spent less time on academics, and more time at Dance Away and other settings. I worked retail as a beauty advisor. It was when I worked as an ER scribe that I finally found the euphoria I’d been chasing since India. I loved serving people through medicine. This is where my love for medicine began. Many doctors strongly encouraged me to apply to medical school, but I wanted to explore more before fully committing. I worked for a medical device company that sold surgical devices for the foot. I trained podiatrists and observed surgeries. I shadowed a physician in a rural city to experience a more relaxed work environment than the ER. I realized the impact I could potentially make as a physician, with my background in Public Health. I could combine research in communities, with the sciences, to create immediate and future changes, locally and abroad. I decided to pursue a medical degree and enrolled in a post-baccalaureate program. Then when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the worldwide lockdown began, I helped to create a response team and worked on 2 projects: Resource19 and Shared Distance, which can be found in more detail in my application.
 
Passion doesn’t always have to be ignited at a young age and consistently present throughout your whole life. Sometimes, passion is cultivated and grown. During undergad, I was unsure of my career path and was therefore focused more on experiences to help me decide. Once I decided, I was focused and determined. This is why my college GPA is low, and my post-bac GPA and MCAT scores are high.
I finally found the answer to how I can make my life meaningful.  I have been mentored by amazing doctors and nurses who have taught me to serve with a compassionate, service-minded attitude. My love for science and my commitment to learning, fused with my passion for serving others will make me a successful doctor.","One experience that enhanced my understanding of inclusion was when I co-founded UC Berkeley‚Äôs Invention Corps. Diversity was a major factor in our consideration of candidates. We created an interdisciplinary community of designers; we accepted 25 students of different ethnicities, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic status. In retrospect, this was fundamental to the functioning and thriving of our organization. Being able to interact and communicate with people of different backgrounds was difficult for some. I remained open-minded, willing to learn, communicative, and respectful of each person. Inclusion of all people facilitated open discussions, leading to more effective solutions. My projects taught me that working with people of different backgrounds and expertise helped engineer solutions through collaboration and open-mindedness. I hope to continue fostering diversity and inclusion in an environment that encourages it, such as at Rush Medical College.","Rush focuses on serving areas impacted by societal and structural determinants of health, which has been an objective of mine since age 11, when I visited India. My grandmother is a physician who established medical care in disadvantaged areas of north India, and being a part of serving in this capacity, inspired me to serve areas that need the most help. I later volunteered at a pregnancy clinic that helped women facing unplanned pregnancy, and who were struggling mentally and financially. I created a club at UC Berkeley, where I worked on two projects that served impoverished areas in India and Ghana. I shadowed a physician in rural Grass Valley, California, so that I could understand the needs of patients living in rural areas. My passion lies with the people in these regions, and the location of Rush provides an opportunity for me to impact residents living in areas that are disproportionately impacted by the social determinants of health.",,,1,"The transition to online learning due to COVID-19 affected my studies.

During COVID-19, my older and immunocompromised grandparents caught the disease. This was during my post-baccalaureate studies. Much of my consequent time was spent caring for them and making sure they were comfortable, while trying not to get sick myself.

Although the mass occupied only a few millimeters physically, it consumed me with uncertainty and fear mentally. It was a week before my high school graduation, a time meant to be filled with hope and promise, but instead spent shuttling in and out of doctor’s visits. The medical world was so foreign to me, but by the end of the month, the smell of ultrasound gel had a newfound familiarity. The ability for my doctors to decode intricate scans from complex imaging equipment fascinated me. As an incoming engineering student, I was driven by the transformative power of technology to bring real life solutions to people, like the ultrasound machines in front of me. My doctors’ most powerful tool, however, was their empathy. They held my hand during difficult conversations, gave me their personal phone numbers, and even counseled my parents who were facing their own fears. As I waited for my biopsy results, I reflected on how I could drive innovation in medical devices while upholding that same level of human connection that had proven to be so valuable to me.

I joined Project MESA as an engineering student, a team focused on building portable gynecological exam tables to donate to mobile clinics in rural Nicaragua. I understood the value of healthcare screening through my own health journey and was motivated to improve access for patients worldwide. Our work felt impactful; our tables had served over 45 Nicaraguan communities and hosted over 1000 cervical cancer screenings. But through my research in obstetrics, I learned inaccessibility to healthcare is not a foreign concept, but rather a harsh reality in our own backyards. I explored how social determinants of health impact the receipt of prenatal care services in the US. I uncovered that these inequities were associated with lower visit utilization, higher preterm births, and higher incidence of postpartum depression. There were even drastic differences in accessibility to simple and routine visits like ultrasounds or nonstress tests. I was troubled to see that patients under the care of the same physician at the same hospital were subject to vastly different pregnancy outcomes due to these social factors. Perhaps more perplexing was that my background in engineering seemed to prioritize ineffectively. My work in optimizing care thus far involved streamlining the healthcare system, but not improving access to it. The uniqueness of this research showed me the importance of combining process improvement and implementation alongside patient advocacy. Otherwise, our most vulnerable patients would never benefit from all the bells and whistles of a sophisticated system.

The following Fall, an internship offer from GE Healthcare allowed me to work on diagnostic technology that had been so pivotal to my own health journey a few years prior. But when the pandemic hit, I was relocated to Madison Wisconsin, home to the ventilator production plant, where production had surged by 1500%. I had been deemed as an “essential worker” contributing to the frontlines of the global pandemic. I wore a mask, safety goggles, and steel toed shoes and spent my days on the production line, streamlining the process to improve output and on-time deliveries all around the world. I was galvanized by the energy and dedication of those around me, countless of whom had come out of retirement to lend a helping hand. But truthfully, I was frustrated. I felt a disconnect between my work and patients on the other end. As I saw Dutch manuals attached to orders to the Netherlands and Korean power cords attached to machines headed East, I couldn’t help but visualize who this ventilator would touch next. Furthermore, I knew there were several systemic barriers preventing deserving patients from reaching these machines. My work was important to patients downstream, but I realized how much I valued their interaction. I knew what it was like to go through a health crisis, and I remembered the crucial impact of my physician’s empathy. Those that were on the other end of the machines I manufactured were going through the same terrifying experience and although these ventilators would help keep them alive, direct human compassion would keep them uplifted.

Although many do not view it as such, I see medicine and engineering as being remarkably similar. In both fields, you enable others with the tools to succeed. In engineering, this tends to happen macroscopically, improving processes and machines large-scale. In medicine, interacting with patients at the individual level and identifying personal needs scopes work at a more microscopic, direct level. My experience in the hospital showed me that despite the intricacies of my ultrasound machine, the most significant aspect of my care was building relationships with my doctors. It was their empathy and kindness that helped me persevere during my own most vulnerable time. I want to be there for patients during theirs.

Ultimately, my biopsy revealed a benign fibroadenoma. The mass would likely be a part of me for the rest of my life, but so would my commitment to advocacy and to improving precision of healthcare delivery to patients who need it most.","After a dementia and heart disease diagnosis, my grandmother came to live with us full-time.

Instead, I was an American soldier on a mission, one of the multiple healthcare professionals who were sent to various regions in the archipelago to heal, teach, and rebuild. Specifically, my mission was to establish contact with the 95th Infantry Battalion and instruct them in combat casualty care.

I arrived at the makeshift classroom, with only two ceiling fans to keep the air flowing across the room during the summer. Not long after my preparations were complete, three Philippine officers approached me. I knew one captain beforehand; the other two had heard about my course and requested that I teach their units as well. One captain said with despondence, “We need to know how to save ourselves.” 

What drove the message home was the fact that in just a few weeks, these soldiers would be deployed to fight the communist New People’s Army in the aftermath of a five-month siege of a city, also known as the Marawi rebellion. I was faced with the responsibility of teaching soldiers not just to pass a class, but to use what they learned in real combat. It was then that I realized I was their only source of training in military medicine. Accepting would mean teaching a class that was originally intended for 35 soldiers to over 130 participants. I wondered what I was getting myself into for a moment, but this has never stopped me before.

I agreed.

To accommodate the increase in participants and overcome my lack of resources, I overhauled the format and reached out to the Philippine Army nurses for additional medical supplies. Each morning, I would walk into a class with soldiers seated on plastic chairs, eyes glued to me with pens ready to write on paper. We worked through the hellish heat of the equator, crawling on the ground to simulate the application of lifesaving interventions while under fire. I went through the motions of tactical field care, showing soldiers how to deal with injured comrades after a firefight and how to perform medical evacuation until it was muscle memory.

My instruction came to an inevitable end. I shook the hand of every soldier I taught. I took a bittersweet photo with the commanders and nurses. I departed the country soon after my American colleagues finished their missions. It was emotional for me because I felt inadequate as their instructor.

I started to think that if I had training as a physician, I could have done more to prepare them for more complex medical scenarios. I believed we had the time; I just lacked the training. I recall sitting in my car one December evening several months later, the night before I needed to sign my reenlistment contract. I had spent days mulling over each option they offered me, but thoughts about my last mission kept gnawing away at my mind. I kept going over what I could have done better, but I recognized that was in the past. I needed to do something to improve who I am for the future.

I realized that having a limited scope of practice held back my desire to learn and do more to help others. I remember having military binders stuffed with flowcharts sitting on our desks whenever I came into the clinic. Every algorithm inside was punctuated by referring to a physician at the earliest sign of complexity. Whenever they were called in, I was in awe of how they navigated the nuances of every case to come up with a final solution. I recognized the deeper considerations behind each medical decision, yet they made it simple for the patient to understand. Witnessing the amount of trust the patient had in them showed me their immense responsibility. The best physicians used each case as a teaching moment, allowing us to learn from their expertise.

Each day I spent as a medic following a binder’s orders, I felt unable to truly think for myself. I was empty and unmotivated, like a drought that sorely needed a deluge. The downpour I needed could only arrive in the form of being a physician, who seemed to know exactly what to do when nobody else did.

Finally, I decided not to reenlist to pursue medicine. I transferred to Emory University soon after my honorable discharge. My first year back in school was notably difficult, but I was able to move past the culture shock of my transition. I found success in my education as an anthropologist studying the intersection between biology and culture. I relished all my courses in humanities, which I feel are understudied assets in medicine. Each course in human tradition, evolution, and religion provided another lens to view patient care.

I keep in mind all of the soldiers I taught, foreign or not, throughout all of this. I was a force multiplier, augmenting every soldier's abilities to keep each other alive. I view physicians as even stronger multipliers, having the capability to educate other members of the healthcare team and improve the standard of care for every patient they come across. I look forward to the opportunity to step into those shoes, no matter how difficult it may be.","After becoming a medic, my first assignment was to South Korea. Seeing as I had only been in the U.S. for less than a year after enlisting, I jumped from one foreign country to the next and took the 18-hour flight to its capital, Seoul. On the ride to my first unit, I distinctly recall staring at the signs all around me. I couldn‚Äôt read them, so I pulled out my phone and started learning right away. I used this knowledge to bridge the gap with my new friends, the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army (KATUSA) soldiers ‚Äì South Korean conscripts spending their military service with us. We exchanged cultural knowledge every day that we could._x000D_
_x000D_
As a future physician, I believe I will be able to capitalize on my ability to integrate with any culture. Coupled with my training in anthropology and religion, I expect to be able to keep an open mind during any patient interaction in order to make them feel heard, comfortable, and secure with the treatment my colleagues and I will render.","In one of my missions, I deployed to the Philippines to teach military medicine to foreign soldiers and medical professionals. Within the same set of objectives, I also trained civilians living in remote areas in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Having grown up in very similar conditions as a former citizen of the country, I resonated with the members of the community more easily than others. It took no time at all to be able to understand what they needed to help them improve their health outcomes. With the help of my team and the medical supplies we brought, we were able to offer not just momentary relief, but also a system that continues to provide essential training to the community. When we encountered issues we were not equipped to handle, such as dental and chronic conditions, we consulted with specialists assigned to the metropolitan areas. Their assistance helped us recognize our limitations, which paved the way for future missions between the Philippines and the United States.",,,1,"As a person that places a premium on hands-on experiences to solidify concepts learned within the classroom, the pandemic affected my ability to be successful in the sciences due to the transition to a purely online curriculum. While I appreciate the hard work and effort made by our university‚Äôs faculty in a novel environment, I still wish I was able to take advantage of the state-of-the-art facilities our departments boasted._x000D_

In terms of research, my plans to participate in the biological anthropology labs provided by my university were also discontinued. This resulted in our cohort taking an important course for my major that was ultimately deprived of essential experiences, such as examining skulls of our ancestors in person. However, I used this opportunity to take on several overloaded semesters in order to fully invest myself in my newfound field of study - anthropology. This allowed me to explore as many interests as I could before diving into the formal study of medicine.",0,0,3

I laid on the stretcher in the UCSF pediatric ED, shaky and numb, contemplating how my hip reconstruction surgery had led to an infection in my back at the epidural site. After countless opioids, MRIs and now the infection, I quickly realized how far I was from a point of recovery; returning to school and my “normal life” seemed impossible. While 2017 was enveloped in pain and isolation, I began to realize how these experiences shaped my passion for human connection and curiosity in the human condition. What was once a source of anxiety and tumult became the impetus behind my journey to become a doctor. 
   Intrigued by mechanical maladies similar to my own, I spent my summer shadowing Dr. Atkin and his third-year medical students. Dr. Atkin’s clinic was in San Francisco’s Mission district, a historically Hispanic, low-income neighborhood, now subjected to bouts of gentrification. As the only cost-free private orthopedic surgeon in SF, a diverse patient cohort hailed from across the Bay Area in the early morning to seek treatment before work. Our first patient, Maria, conveyed tenderness in her shoulder and pain when she tried to lift her daughter. Although exhausted, Maria was grateful for our physical examination, amidst the guarded winces. Within a small office, we inspect Maria’s MRI and corroborate observations with pertinent positives and negatives from the earlier examination. I manipulate the life-sized skeleton in the corner of the office to visualize my theories. As the medical students and I knit together pieces of the puzzle, acromion impingement arises as the diagnosis. We reenter the exam room to share the news. Maria feels relief for her diagnosis, yet I see the heaviness that becomes her as she learns of treatment: surgery. The uncertainty and instability that comes with recovery poses questions of who will care for her kids and how she will work. Dr. Atkin saw the distress following diagnosis and lent support towards Maria, with comforting words, comprehensive, yet digestible explanations of what treatment and recovery would entail and lastly, a hand to hold. The lengths Dr. Atkin went to for his community, the free-of-charge appointments, the primary use of Spanish and accommodations of odd hours, inspired me to bring forth that same dedication to those around me. While my notepads became filled with poorly drawn sketches of shoulders, notes of cruciate ligaments in the knee and mantras of Dr. Atkin, the weight of responsibility for someone’s livelihood became a prominent thought in my head. As I pondered how as a future physician, I could change the course for my patients subjected to systemic barriers like Maria, I engaged with each patient and allowed them to be vulnerable and scared, even if it meant just holding their hand. If I was able to aid their experience in such a small way as a college student, I reveled in the possibilities I might have as a doctor. 
   Tightly grasping the knowledge I gained by working with Dr. Atkin, I traveled across the country to Boston. Unbeknownst to me, working as an EMT through the height of the pandemic would not only reinforce the lessons previously learned while shadowing Dr. Atkin, but also expand my medical knowledge and perspective on healthcare as I attended to patients in the back of an ambulance. The rundown, lonely nursing homes where COVID ran ramped and the government-funded housing where COPD flares were ignored, due to the high cost of ambulances and medications, ravaged these communities. As the first face of help, I saw a myriad of emotions in the patients I served. Escalating respiratory failure was met with adequate supplementary oxygen and frequent vitals, but also emotional support, even if it just meant holding their hand. I explained the purpose of the SPO2 monitor to my patients when I clipped it on their finger, as I noticed the number of hospitalizations listed on their charts. I wondered how this list would differ if they did not have to worry about paying for their next oxygen tank or obtaining access to their albuterol. I wanted to provide comprehensive explanations of their condition and treatment, so they could make informed decisions about their health, as I had experienced with Dr. Atkin and my own doctors, yet I was limited by my scope of practice and knowledge. While I savored the triumphs of healthcare, specifically in emergency medicine, the tribulations were burned into my memory. In turn, I saw the many ways I hope to alleviate the burden for my patients as a doctor and offer meaningful explanations regarding their health.
   Although the surgical scars on my back and hip remind me of a difficult crossroads I faced a few years prior, I am now met with years of experiences shaped by connections with my patients and my communities in SF and Boston. I think of the years of knowledge that are gradually fulfilling my curiosity not only about the human body and all its wonders, but also all the ways it can fail. As I continue my journey, I hope to utilize my ever-growing knowledge and personal experiences to provide meaningful care to all individuals.","For years, I felt like an imposter. On the outside, I had no visible scars or deformities caused by my congenital hip dysplasia and corrective surgery. Despite this, I am reminded of my condition through my concealed scars, screws in my hip and residual pain. I have recognized that my path to diagnosis and treatment is not the same for all. My experience living with an invisible disability has inspired me to serve as an advocate for those who face barriers, such as systemic inequalities and disabilities. Invigorated to provide meaningful care to underserved communities, I pursued my journey in healthcare. I would frequently encounter patients deteriorating due to a lack of understanding of their condition or inability to afford medications. My experiences, as a patient and healthcare worker, not only revealed my desire to become a doctor that is cognizant of the challenges my patients face, but also knowledgeable on sociocultural factors and values that define their community. ","As a technology tutor at Rosie‚Äôs Place, I have the opportunity to teach women, who are experiencing homelessness and poverty, how to use a mouse and type. While it is challenging to comprehensively explain what a mouse is, and how you use it, I have realized how my word choice may be perceived differently by someone who did not grow up with English or with a computer. I observe how small adjustments to my explanations are far more beneficial than others. Moreover, my understanding of technology and teaching has completely shifted. I grew up with a tool that allowed me to readily shape my perspective through news articles, social media and infinite information; however, once the women at Rosie's Place step away from the computer at the end of our session, they don't see it again for days or weeks. Their access to information and freedom to learn from the internet is inherently limited and with each session, I learn to accommodate these differences as best I can.",,,1,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my pursuit of research opportunities was disrupted. As a result, I chose to delve into clinical experiences. Working through the pandemic was met with strict protocols and scared patients. These novel situations pushed me to better utilize my limited resources and strengthen my clinical skills within the unknown territory COVID had created. The rise of omicron and staff shortages at the end of 2021 proved to be a significant challenge. After eventually getting COVID in January due to a full COVID patient caseload, it took me a month to recover. Consequently, I was forced to push back my MCAT. While I am proud of my recovery, it was difficult to see my MCAT score as an accurate reflection of my capabilities. This experience reaffirmed that growth is not always linear, and there are times where external circumstances can heavily influence a journey. I have learned to approach challenges in life, school and healthcare with a desire to learn and grow.",1,1,1

Jake’s frustration soon led to self-harming behaviors as he anxiously began to bite his hands. Seeking to help, I encouraged Jake to bite his sensory chewie and practice his breathing exercises. However, this did not calm him, and I felt helpless as Jake began to bleed from the freshly opened scars on his hands. In this challenging moment, I sought guidance from my supervisor on how I could better help Jake in his efforts to communicate and effectively cope with stressful circumstances. I was instructed to meet Jake’s psychological needs by consistently providing him with sensory input. I readily applied my supervisor’s direction by providing sensory pressure to Jake’s hands and arms. This relieved Jake’s stress, and he was happier and more attentive as he participated in his learning programs. This experience introduced me to the psychological aspect of effective patient care. I recognized that in addition to his prescribed medications and learning programs, Jake had psychological needs that, when met, could improve his overall health and well-being. Understanding this, Jake and I were able to work together and overcome barriers to his wellness.

In addition to understanding the psychological aspect of patient care, a unique experience I had interacting with “Ryan” has prepared me to address the social aspects of health. Ryan was the concerned and supportive uncle of a child that presented to the Children’s Justice Center following a potential case of sexual abuse. After I completed my duties of helping the child feel safe and comfortable for his forensic medical exam and interview, I had the opportunity to speak with Ryan. Ryan began by expressing concern about his nephew but then opened up about his current challenges as a member of the LGTBQ+ community. Many of his challenges resulted from living in an area that often harbors negative attitudes towards that community due to prevailing social norms. My research experience investigating the impact of social factors on health and well-being put me in a better position to listen compassionately to Ryan, understand his needs, and offer words of support. As we spoke, his concerns began to give way to feelings of hope and belonging. I am grateful I was present at this moment to help Ryan and experience firsthand the importance of social understanding in delivering quality care to patients and their loved ones. Ryan received the support he needed and was, in turn, better prepared to care for his nephew. This experience also encouraged me to continue participating in research that focuses on the social determinants of health. Such research has helped me better understand individual patients and the social factors that disproportionately affect health outcomes in specific communities.  

Lastly, in working as a medical scribe at a neurosurgery clinic, I began to understand the biological aspect of patient care. I recognized that the providers’ understanding of human anatomy and biomedical technology enabled them to convey medical knowledge to patients. This gave patients a greater understanding of their health and empowered them to make decisions regarding their treatment plan. As I diligently sought to become more familiar with the biomedical technology employed at the clinic, I was also able to participate in the biological aspect of patient care. On one occasion, as I collected a new patient’s past medical history, she expressed that she was anxious about her appointment because she assumed that a neurosurgery consultation guaranteed invasive spinal surgery. Using my recently acquired knowledge of the clinic’s medical interventions, I informed the patient that the neurosurgeon offered alternative treatment options to invasive spinal surgery. I then encouraged her to feel comfortable discussing these options and any concerns she had with the neurosurgeon. Our conversation helped ease the patient’s worries and gave her a greater sense of autonomy in making treatment decisions.   
    
I believe I am ready to begin the journey of a physician. I am prepared to meet challenges through collaborating with others, such as in my experience seeking my supervisor’s help to recognize and care for psychological needs. I am committed to increasing my knowledge of the social determinants of health and combatting social inequality so that no patient or their loved ones feel marginalized or unsupported. Additionally, I am dedicated to understanding biomedical technology to effectively guide patients in making treatment decisions. I want to become a physician, so I can draw upon my experiences to meet the psychological, social, and biological requirements of patient care. I am prepared to use my experiences and acquire essential skills in medical school to best serve patients and their loved ones with this holistic approach to healing.","I served as a volunteer representative for two years in Manila, Philippines. In this role, I worked with many Filipino associates in conducting weekly community service projects among the local population. To effectively coordinate with my Filipino associates and meet the needs of the local people, I had to become proficient in the native language, Tagalog, and gain a sufficient understanding of Filipino culture. I started by critiquing my own biases and acknowledging what I did not know about Filipino culture. I then frequently sought guidance from my Filipino associates. In learning from them, I gained a deeper appreciation of the Filipino language and traditions and was able to develop meaningful relationships within the community. Through this experience, I recognized that cultural humility is essential to understanding those unlike myself. I will continue to evaluate my own beliefs and biases and seek to learn from the diverse populations I serve as a physician. ","In my medical sociology course, I completed an original analysis of data examining access to healthcare among US children exposed to adverse childhood experiences. These children need quality care to mitigate the long-term negative impacts of such experiences on well-being. However, my data analysis showed that children exposed to adverse experiences have less access to care than children not exposed to such experiences. This disparity may be linked to social factors such as stress, lack of social support, and increased economic uncertainty in marginalized neighborhoods. _x000D_

To help this community of children, I have participated in organizations that ensure children exposed to traumatic experiences receive the care they need. I volunteered as a peer mentor at the Utah State Hospital to befriend and meet the needs of a pediatric patient exposed to abuse. Currently, I am volunteering at the Children's Justice Center to assist and support children that have been victims of sexual abuse.",,,1,"I volunteered as a peer mentor for a pediatric mental health patient at the Utah State Hospital. I was very excited about this position because I enjoy empowering children and adolescents to pursue their goals by helping them overcome barriers to their health and wellness. I hoped to volunteer as a peer mentor for a year. However, the hospital closed the mentoring program after three months due to COVID-19. COVID-19 also interrupted my ability to shadow and observe physicians in person. While hospitals were closed to student observation, I registered for an online shadowing program to better understand a physician's role and daily schedule. This program offered weekly presentations from physicians in a variety of specialties. I completed about 25 hours of online shadowing, which provided me with key insights into the life of a physician. This experience supplemented the in-person shadowing I completed after hospital restrictions eased.",1,0,2

I never took the nickname seriously because most immigrant parents aspire to give their children the opportunity to pursue professional careers such as medicine. His aspiration for me slowly morphed into my desire as I became more exposed to the medical field and intrigued by its biological underpinnings. Biology sparked my curiosity and I became quickly absorbed by the subject in school. My teachers quickly took note of my enthusiasm and found ways to foster it through extracurricular activities such as dissection labs and book recommendations. By the time I started at St. Thomas there was no question I wanted to major in biology. As I dove deeper into my coursework, I also sought out hands-on research experiences such as working in an environmental toxicology lab where I gained countless new skills and knowledge difficult to transfer in a classroom setting. I became deeply entrenched in my passion for biology and inspired to pursue a career where I could apply the knowledge I was gaining to help care for people in their most vulnerable moments.  
My interest in being a physician was also confirmed by volunteering and shadowing experiences at Fairview Southdale Hospital. The volunteer program strengthened my desire to work with people because I enjoy connecting with diverse patient populations and trying to make a positive impact on their care journeys. While volunteering, I jumped at opportunities to help hospital staff and engage in conversations regarding what inspired them to choose their career paths. Through these conversations I gained insightful advice and the belief that with perseverance I could walk through those same halls in the future as a physician.  
Volunteering also opened the door for me to shadow in the operating room and be mentored by an anesthesiologist at Fairview. This life changing mentorship opportunity affirmed my passion for medicine as I observed Dr. Pershing perform procedures that seemed beyond the bounds of reality. Most strikingly I was inspired by Dr. Pershing’s calm leadership and authority over the operating room during an emergent case. His expertise combined with his immense sense of responsibility for each patient shone through as he and everyone in the OR did everything possible to save the life on the table. Watching the orchestra of people and equipment shuffle in and out of the OR was awe-inspiring; my life was forever changed in that moment knowing I wanted to be on the other side helping.
Soon after this experience, I began working as a pharmacy technician to widen my breadth of knowledge about the healthcare system outside of a hospital setting. Working in the pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic uncovered my eagerness to be on the frontlines helping despite the risk. I felt a responsibility to use my abilities in order to ensure people had access to their medications and were able to receive a vaccination once available. Working in the pharmacy confirmed my interest in medicine and made me realize I find the most joy in the clinical aspects of healthcare. I greatly value my time as a pharmacy technician, but I want to be on the other side of the prescription pad practicing as a physician and dedicating my time to caring for patients and using my knowledge to enrich patients’ health and ultimately their lives.  
Although my education, volunteering, shadowing, and work experience greatly influenced my decision to pursue medicine, my background and upbringing also played a pivotal role. As a second generation immigrant I am more aware of the current gaps in representation in our healthcare system, and I want to be part of the solution to making our doctors more representative of the populations they serve. Additionally, as the daughter of a Middle-Eastern immigrant I am highly appreciative of the opportunity to further my education because not all women in my culture are afforded the same chance. My parents have been outspoken advocates for my education and proud supporters of my medical school aspirations even when it went against cultural norms. 
I want to use my diverse background to relate to patients on a level only possible due to shared experience. I was able to attend St. Thomas on a full tuition scholarship awarded based on academic excellence and my commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Through the events and workshops associated with my scholarship program, I learned to embrace my diversity as a strength rather than a disadvantage. Being able to connect and empathize with people from all different backgrounds is a quality that would make me an outstanding physician. My lived experience as a second generation immigrant and as someone who has struggled to embrace their identity make me especially cognizant of the struggles faced by other minority populations who are often overlooked. 
Becoming Dr. Amal would not only fulfill a personal dream, but also represent a victory for all who support me and saw my potential even before I did. I never thought medical school was something attainable for me because of cultural barriers, financial worries, and self-doubt. Although challenging, these struggles were also the things that drove me to fight harder for my dream that I hope to make a reality.","Volunteering in a hospital and as a tutor in an urban middle school, I took opportunities to connect with patients and students from varying backgrounds, socio-economic statuses, and differing urban and rural upbringings. I gained new perspective and deepened my understanding and empathy for the unique challenges diverse populations face. _x000D_
As a pharmacy technician I interact with various patient populations and enjoy relating to and learning about individuals‚Äô cultural backgrounds, religious beliefs, gender identities, and native languages. I foster inclusive environments by making an effort to learn common phrases in other languages or refer to patients using their preferred pronouns. _x000D_
Furthermore, the mission of my college scholarship was to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Through this program, I shared my own background and learned about others through workshops, involvement in campus events, and participation in a peer mentorship program for underrepresented students. _x000D_
","As our state went into full lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, I continued to work at the pharmacy ensuring people received their medications. One of my close friend‚Äôs family was hit especially hard by the news of the pandemic because both her and her mom have autoimmune diseases that would make catching COVID-19 particularly devastating. Their family took Minnesota‚Äôs stay-at-home orders very seriously and limited their physical contact with everyone. Since the pharmacy I work at is located in a grocery store, I would pick up groceries for their family and drop them on the doorstep after my shifts. This small gesture meant more to them than I could‚Äôve imagined. For me it was something I could easily do to help ease their anxiety during this time when everyone was struggling. This experience showed me that simple acts of kindness can have positive impacts that are disproportionately greater than you‚Äôd expect. ",,,1,"The pandemic presented innumerable challenges as we struggled to adjust to a world that was crumbling around us. Half of my undergraduate experience was remote learning; this made it difficult to achieve goals I set to conduct undergraduate research.

Many extracurricular activities I normally participated in were also put on hold. This included forced breaks from the Fairview Southdale Hospital volunteer program and the volunteering I did through St. Thomas. _x000D_
I continued to work at the pharmacy during this time despite my serious concerns about living at home and potentially passing on illness to my family members with pre-existing conditions.

My son … he’s … he’s unresponsive and his eyes are rolling!” My mother’s frightful, pleading words filled my ears as my infant brother stiffened and twitched. Within minutes, EMS had arrived to transport him to the hospital. While the ER team worked deftly, the chaos and uncertainty surrounding my brother’s health weighed heavily on me as a six-year-old. Among the fear and commotion, a doctor knelt before me, looked into my tearing eyes, and reassured me with words I will never forget: “Don’t lose hope. We’ll bring him back.” I was awed by the team’s dedication to meeting my brother’s medical needs and understanding our cultural values of our recent immigration from India as they delivered compassionate care to him and our family. My brother thankfully regained consciousness after nearly 40 minutes of experiencing a febrile seizure. That moment ignited my dedication to becoming a physician. Since then, I have worked diligently to obtain the education, experience, and skills necessary to become a physician who provides the same compassionate, culturally aware, and personalized care to my future patients. 

Many years later, I returned to the hospital, not as a visitor but as a patient transport volunteer. Through many discharges, I witnessed immigrant patients facing the burdens of healthcare, including health illiteracy, ineligible health coverage, and fear. One such patient, “Luis,” was a recent migrant from Mexico and a victim of prolonged hospitalization due to liver cirrhosis. While in the hospital, he struggled to communicate with health care professionals, had rare visits from friends, and was despondent for the entirety of his stay. Upon speaking with health care providers and integrating my own exploration, I gained valuable insight into Luis’s liver cirrhosis and how it was affecting his overall physical and mental health. Seeing his despair, I approached him and said, “¡Hola! ¿Como está usted?” His smile told me that he appreciated my effort to connect with him through his native language. I consoled Luis through sharing my personal experiences of confronting cultural and medical challenges in an immigrant family. In Spanish, I encouraged him to progress in his recovery and used every break I had during my shift as an opportunity to continue our conversation, empathizing with the struggles and obstacles he had faced as an immigrant. Building a relationship through language and motivating patients in their recoveries reinforced my ability to combine language with clinical discovery to create individualized, transformative patient care. 

My desire to be a compassionate physician who connects with patients and places their needs first was further shaped by my experience working in a primary care clinic serving disadvantaged patients in my community. One patient, “Rose,” was a 64-year-old African American woman who had quadriplegia and expressive aphasia from a car accident in her youth. Because she consistently arrived alone on a motorized wheelchair, the health care team assumed she lacked a support system to assist her. The first few visits were unfruitful as many of us struggled to comprehend her fragmented speech. I gained knowledge of Rose’s aphasia after receiving advice from speech therapists. On a subsequent visit, I had the opportunity to speak and work with her directly. To help us communicate, I wrote down common words and had her pronounce them to better understand Rose’s speech patterns. Over the next several weeks, our conversations grew deeper. I sat eye level with her as we bonded over growing up with cultural differences, including pastimes and holidays. As I spent more time with Rose and our connection deepened, I learned she lived in an assisted living center where her needs were not being met. Unfortunately, she was afraid to voice her concerns over fear of being mistreated. Concerned for Rose’s welfare, I shared the insights I gained from my conversations with her to the rest of the team to help get her transferred to a new assisted living center, where I directly communicated her needs to the caretakers there. Working with patients like Rose further developed my compassion and sensitivity, and I will continue to advocate for future patients to help exceed their needs. 

Long gone is that young boy who feared losing his brother. My experiences in health care have motivated me to continue exploring medicine through empowering patients and advocating for their needs. I see myself as a physician who will be a beacon of reassurance and hope to patients and families, especially during times of distress. I desire to carry my calling into medicine by opening a free clinic that aids struggling patients in navigating healthcare. Dedicated to connecting and engaging meaningfully with all my patients, I will mold a standard of care that is culturally aware, individualized to each patient, and open to all clinical discoveries.","My unique knowledge of being a puppy raiser for Leader Dogs for the Blind can enhance the diversity of Rush Medical College through my ability to see different perspectives. Raising puppies has allowed me to understand the daily challenges of those without sight, thereby helping them gain mobility, confidence, and independence with the assistance of a guide dog. Through advocating for those with vision problems by training my puppies in various environments, such as stores and schools, I help spread awareness of visual impairments and promote the inclusion of those less fortunate. During training, I attempt to understand the world from a puppy‚Äôs point of view, which enables me to set them up for success by positively reinforcing acceptable behaviors and redirecting inappropriate ones. Strengthening my perspective-taking will allow me to better understand the viewpoints of future peers and colleagues in our collaborative efforts and have a higher level of empathy toward future patients.","The most impactful experience has been my role as a geriatric health care assistant, where I help deliver medical care and support to home-bound senior patients. This experience has been incredibly impactful to me as I have been exposed to many obstacles, such as health illiteracy, language barriers, and cultural differences, that elderly face in acquiring equitable health care. Having been exposed to these facets of medicine early has enabled me to be innovative in discovering ways to help patients and families alleviate struggles. From discovering patients‚Äô lifestyles through communicating in Spanish to explaining treatment plans to giving ideas for relaxing music, I am gratified to improve the health of the elderly community. My role as a geriatric health care assistant has inspired me to open a clinic that delivers compassionate, personalized care to older adults to meet their medical needs, overcome barriers to health care, and reduce the effects of social determinants of health.",,,1,"Similar to other students experiencing virtual college courses, limited clinical experiences, and paused research endeavors, I transitioned into college amid the pandemic. Though I sought out direct patient contact experiences and research, healthcare settings were not allowing students to work directly with patients and university labs were shut down. Despite the challenges I encountered, I became involved in puppy raising for Leader Dogs for the Blind, volunteered in a mass vaccination center, and founded the organization Grizzlies Give at Oakland University. In my ventures, I learned ways to serve and impact those who have been more greatly affected by the pandemic. From these experiences, I discovered an aspect of creativity in acquiring unique experiences, especially during times of crises. As a future physician and leader, I aspire to serve patients to help them overcome challenges and will continue to engage in diverse experiences while supporting various patient populations.",1,0,3

I dashed from my room to find her scrambling up from the floor, blood pouring from her nose as she stared up at me from the landing she’d just fallen from. Despite my terror, my protective sister instincts kicked in, and I flew down the stairs to her side. My arms remained tightly wrapped around her the entire drive to the hospital. After an hour spent nervously fidgeting in the ER waiting area, a doctor emerged, approaching my mother and I to deliver the update. Thankfully, my sister’s injuries were fairly minor. She had suffered a laceration to her columella, but after a few stitches to close the wound, she was recovering well. 

Listening to the physician, I felt my suffocating fear and anxiety dissipate. The doctor was calm and kind, and when she left to tend to my sister once again, I felt markedly better. For the first time, I came to understand that a physician doesn’t just help the person on the exam table––they also have the power to positively affect the patient’s loved ones. I saw first-hand the ripple effect of medicine: help one person and you can improve the lives of countless others. Even at the age of twelve, I was captivated by this idea, and a determination to touch people’s lives in the same way that my sister’s doctor had settled in my mind. 

As I grew older, exposure to anatomy and biochemistry created a personal fascination with the human body. As I delved into studying science, I developed an appreciation of the importance of education, which I recognized as another avenue to touch people’s lives. My experience founding a nonprofit, focused on bringing free SAT tutoring to students in my hometown, was a uniquely fulfilling application of this realization. Yet, I missed science, and my desire to heal people medically still felt incomplete. In my time as a scribe, I saw my passion for education fit seamlessly with that desire.

Walking into the exam room, I smiled at the patient, a kind-hearted older gentleman named Greg. Greg was no stranger to the office; the doctor I worked under had seen him three times in the last month due to a melanoma on his back. Looking over his surgical path report with a pleased expression, the doctor said, “It looks like we got it all, the margins are free and there is no further work needed.” At the news, Greg’s face split into a grin. He listened intently as the doctor reminded him to remain vigilant about sun protection, and the specific features of a lesion that make it suspicious. Struck by the way the doctor acted as a teacher for the patient, I was once again reminded of the ripple effect of medicine. This time, I saw how physicians offer knowledge to each patient they treat: information that is then transmitted to the patient's peer circle, allowing its impact to continue to grow. I saw my thoughts reflected in real life when Greg’s sister came into the office the next week for a full body skin check. Fascinated by this discovery, I’d feel a surge of fulfillment each time I reassured a patient about the benefits of a procedure. However, watching a patient's psoriasis flare because they couldn’t afford medication and seeing lupus patients suffer through joint pain because of pricey copays, I grasped the unfair expense of achieving good health. I felt drawn to help provide healthcare to those who often cannot access it, which led me to act as a medical volunteer at a clinic for people experiencing homelessness in downtown Los Angeles.

Sweating in my blue scrubs, I flipped the exam room for the next patient, a middle-aged woman named Krysta. As the nurse brought her into the room, she immediately doubled over, hacking intensely. A twinge in the sound of her voice made me hand her a bucket, and I bit back a gasp as Krysta vomited blood. The nurse signaled me to notify the physician, and after I explained her condition to the doctor, he asked me to assist the next patient while he went to see Krysta. I hesitated, but kept moving. At the end of the day, I asked the doctor for an update on Krysta’s condition. I was hit with a wave of grief, confusion, and guilt after learning she’d been sent to the emergency room and had passed away there. Struck by an understanding of how quickly a patient's condition can become critical and the tragedy of a lost human life, I felt a small part of the burden that physicians carry. I thought of the ripple effect once more––this time picturing the responsibility implicit in the opportunity. Working in the clinic the next day, I felt changed. Krysta’s memory offered important context to each patient interaction, and witnessing loss cemented my desire to work tirelessly to improve people's physical and emotional health. 

The waiting room chair where I sat awaiting news about my sister comes to mind often these days, and as I reflect on my passion to become a doctor, I marvel at how my perspective on the ripple effect of medicine, the one that captured my attention so long ago, has shifted, grown, and matured just as I have. I understand now that the profession of healing people, and thus touching the lives of so many others, is a privilege, burden, and magnificent opportunity that I cannot imagine my future without.","While working at a needle exchange site, a place where people can obtain sterile needles in order to decrease the spread of bloodborne diseases, I was asked to speak to protestors outside the clinic. I heard the somewhat misinformed argument that I expected, that needle-exchanges result in more drugs. However, I also heard a mother speak about her son who contracted Hepatitis B because of a discarded needle. Hearing the pain in her voice made my plan to support my argument with figures seem callous. I realized that I could not ask this woman to listen to statistics while she believed our clinic made light of her son‚Äôs suffering. As I sympathized with her and offered our clinic‚Äôs free treatment services, her anger lessened. Only after this interaction did I attempt to communicate the positive impact of our clinic. Interacting with protestors, I grasped that understanding the beliefs held by others must begin with taking time to recognize the experiences that inform their beliefs._x000D_
","Answering the phone with a tentative hello, I felt surprised as a counselor from the largest public school in Dayton introduced himself. He asked me about Test Prep for Success, the nonprofit I had run for two years at this point, and said he had a student that was exceptional, but needed an amount of attention he couldn't offer. I hesitated, as the upcoming session was full, but hearing the desperation in his voice, I agreed. The student, Trey, was quick to distraction and uninterested at first. As I got to know Trey and he bonded with our team of tutors, he blossomed. By the end of the session, he was scoring in the 90th percentile and on his official ACT, he scored 12 points above his first practice test. Trey called me when he got into college and told me about the promise he made to his grandmother to be the first in his family to attend college. As he thanked me for allowing him to make his promise a reality, I assured him that it was only his hard work that brought him there.",,,1,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I took Physics I & II P/F, as I needed to move home to Ohio to be the primary caretaker for my grandmother and thus did not have access to the correct lab materials.

My mind was flooded with memories of the challenges I overcame and those who encouraged me along the way as I flew back to the more familiar landscape of Michigan. 

My interest in medicine began in high school. I became a certified nursing assistant in 2012. During this time, I got feedback from the nurses who said, “Derek, you soak up knowledge like a sponge.” I was constantly curious about the underlying physiology behind the treatments we were administering, following nurses around and asking what they were doing and, most importantly, why. I spent two years in this role. Reflecting on its significance, I feel it’s where my passion for serving humanity began. But I wanted more, and I felt I had reached a barrier that could only be overcome through education, so I reenrolled at my community college. 

During my first semester, I took a microbiology course with Dr. Matt Badtke, a young professor passionate about encouraging students. I shared with my dad how fascinating the class was, and how I liked learning about the microscopic organisms that live in and around us.  Excitedly, my dad told me he had kept my great-grandfather’s microscope and tissue slides from his years in medical school in the 1920s. I was so excited to show this antique to Dr. Badtke, so I took the microscope and slides to his office. As we examined the tissue samples, I felt like I was transported through time, looking through the microscope like my great-grandfather as a medical student. Dr. Badtke later nominated me for a student excellence award in microbiology and encouraged me to apply for the Community College Summer Fellowship Program at the University of Michigan.

I completed the summer research program, and a semester later, in 2015, transferred to the University of Michigan. At that time, I was questioning if studying science was the right path for me. I started taking Spanish classes, which led to a study abroad in Barcelona, Spain, in 2017. In Spain, I realized that the history of art was a field of study that combined my interests in culture, psychology, languages, and the arts. I discovered the intersection of art and medicine while working on an independent research project about the artwork produced by institutionalized psychiatric patients. I had a revelation about the similarities between the artist and the patient. They both need their culture, history, and unique story understood, not just the surface-level details of an illness or a brush stroke, but instead the path they took. I saw that individuals are shaped by their experiences which shape their health and well-being. This rekindled my interest in medicine.

During the months I spent in Peru, I initially struggled with my Spanish, but as I became a part of the community I served, I became more fluent and learned the vocabulary of the region. This allowed me to experience things I would not have otherwise. My students taught me a traditional Peruvian dance. We danced around the classroom together as their parents clapped along. My students ranged from 5 to 18 years old, but one student in particular, 10-year-old Henry, challenged me the most in the classroom. I could always count on Henry to interrupt the other students' answers or ask off-topic questions. He couldn’t help it. He was so eager to learn. I told him I liked his enthusiasm but reminded him we had to take turns speaking in class. That redirection only lasted 15 minutes until he couldn’t handle waiting anymore. But rather than let this bother me, I invited him to talk with me about his interests after class, and this became our regular thing. Henry taught me that sometimes the most challenging people are ultimately the most rewarding. 

As a teacher during the pandemic, I saw how limited my support was in Peru. It was evident that the community I served no longer needed a teacher; instead, they needed a doctor to support them. I saw the community’s medical system failing. They had run out of oxygen, COVID tests, and personal protective equipment. I felt helpless that I was unable to do more for them. Poverty made the community extremely vulnerable to unforeseen circumstances. I saw the full effect of social determinants on health and the inequities in their healthcare that weren’t initially visible until the need for emergency medical care caused doctors to make difficult decisions as they triaged patients. 

Leaving Peru was difficult; plans to be there for three months turned into eight, and potentially longer, but COVID truncated my plans.  My flight went from Lima, Peru to Miami to Detroit, and shortly thereafter, I arrived at my childhood home, where my mother greeted me. Life oddly felt full circle as I moved back into my old bedroom. I shared the stories of what I learned on my journey. I related the struggles of a community where half of the students do not reach the basic standards in reading, science, and mathematics. I tried to convey the barrier of poverty that dictates their lives, education, and health. I told my mom that, given my need to serve humanity, I was ready to pursue the study of medicine.","My first time abroad was in Barcelona, Spain. I spent eight weeks as a study abroad student over the summer of 2017. I joined my host mom to celebrate the culture of Catalonia and participated in traditional dances and food preparation; I surpassed anything I could ever learn through a book alone. From this trip, I realized the value of learning through lived experiences, which developed my abundance of openness to embracing the lives of others. I believe that everyone can teach us something new when we put aside our beliefs and assumptions to listen to their stories and lived experiences through the lens of their identities. My first time aboard changed how I experienced life, and I continued to build off what I learned in Spain during my time as a volunteer in Per√∫ from September 2019 to April 2020.","While teaching with Superlearner in Per√∫, I worked to address the inequities in their education system. I was challenged to be resourceful. This challenge was not easy; I had to be creative with my materials yet effective in my work to empower my students. So, I met with the families and their children to better understand their needs. I wanted to create a curriculum that excited my students, met their interests, and improved the areas of their education that were underdeveloped. I deliberately worked to understand everyone‚Äôs ideas and suggestions because I knew I did not know what was best for them. I put the community at the center of my work because I knew that is how I would meet their needs and make lasting improvements in their community. I shared what I had learned from the community with the other volunteers and the President of Superlearner, and we collaborated to successfully meet their educational needs.",,,1,"While I was in Peru during the onset of the pandemic, the effects the social and political determinants of health had on the community I served became so apparent. The disproportionate effects the pandemic has had on marginalized communities emphasized their lack of access to preventive healthcare, which increased the risk of complications due to untreated conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. These healthcare disparities have motivated me to become a physician, so I can create change through social justice to improve health equity. Being abroad during such an unprecedented time tested my adaptability and resilience to the evolving health crisis and lockdown rules. I quickly realized that nothing had challenged my language skills more than needing to know with 100% accuracy what the Ministry of Health and the President of Peru said during their daily briefings.",1,0,3

This 14-year-old female was my younger sister, Zoe, and after ruling out any dangerous pathology, the cause was deemed: idiopathic. Idiopathic is a  word: ""idio"" referring to self, and pathic referring to a disease; together, they mean a condition of its own and further meaning a disease of unknown cause. Hours earlier that night, I heard a shrill cry coming from my sister’s room. I ran to her and found her right eyelid had swollen to the size of a golf ball, completely obstructing her vision. We were home alone that night, so I grabbed her hand, helped her into the car, and drove her straight to the ER. 
 
I remember meditating on the possibility of a disease of unknown origin, naïve to the limitations of known medicine. It was this mystery and the vastness of the unknown that provoked me to search for an answer accepting the risk that I may never find one. Despite this quandary, I observed how much the subsequent ophthalmologists, dermatologists, and allergists cared about Zoe’s well-being. Their commitment to finding a solution deeply resonated with me. They were all professional and empathetic, using their knowledge to provide thoughtful and considerate care. They served as educators, explaining to me the anatomy and physiology behind the symptoms Zoe suffered from.

I felt powerless. I couldn’t fix this problem like her big brother always had. I decided to pour myself into the medical literature, looking for answers. I saw myself as a detective of sorts, piecing together the clues and creating theories to explain this illness. I took this case on “pro bono”, as I would joke with her, knowing I had the capacity to make a difference, and thus began my path to medicine.
 
Soon, I became a medical assistant at a dermatology clinic, and I loved working in this environment. I especially enjoyed making the patients and staff laugh, forming close relationships. Over a two-week span, we strangely saw three separate cases of purple toes. The physicians and I were stumped by these skin manifestations due to the patients’ histories and ages. The patients were frustrated with their mysterious symptoms, and I understood their predicament. I shared their frustration and empathized with their fear. So, I donned my sleuth cap and hit the books. I found a possible connection to new findings from COVID-positive patients in Europe. Fortunately, the providers confirmed this discovery, enabling us to give the patients a much-needed explanation. I was ecstatic to help solve our patients’ cases and awed by the power a team working in harmony can have on our patients' lives. I knew that medicine was my passion and understood that I would be the physician that put a smile on every patient’s face.
 
This same passion led me to choose to major in Molecular and Cellular Biology to understand the mechanisms and building blocks of the human body more thoroughly. Just as a detective must understand the mind of the criminal, I chose to explore the mind of physiology and disease. Hungry for more, I pursued a position at a microbiological research lab, where I received a mountain of new cases. Pioneering novel biological systems and mechanisms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen that plagues Cystic Fibrosis patients, was an opportunity that allowed me to delve deeper into the science that intrigued me.

As I pushed the boundaries of discovery, failure and I quickly became best friends. I designed a project to create a new mutant strain devoid of any nutrient transporters to investigate the mechanism of the pathogen’s survival. After a rigorous 2-week process, my initial mutagenesis came back as a failure. This was unfortunately followed by two months of repeated failures. Informative meetings with my professor yielded several potential remedies to my situation. Nevertheless, the solution remained unknown, and I had a new case to solve.

Although the unknown was the source of my struggle, the unknown also became the source of my resolve. The slightest possibility of my research contributing to new medical discoveries or pharmaceutical breakthroughs against Cystic Fibrosis drove me to solve this mystery. Eventually, I discovered the source of my anguish was a batch of contaminated primers; as such, my failure was guaranteed from the start. I recognized the unfaltering plight of research physicians and my own resilience in the face of adversity, understanding I shared their commitment to finding answers with only a glimmer of hope.

Medicine provides the perfect opportunity for me to battle against mysteries that have a human impact. I am infatuated with learning how different diseases occur and how I can use that knowledge to help others through challenging moments in their lives. Moreover, I hope to become the type of physician that will advocate for patients like my sister who suffer without answers. I admire the opportunity to sleuth as a part of a team, as no great detective operates alone. I look forward to serving my community with curiosity, confidence, and kindness and aim to reassure my patients that there is an answer, or we will not stop until one is found.","I have lived in and around Chicago my entire life, which has enabled me to understand how powerful the diversity of my city is. Encountering various cultures throughout my life has made me appreciative of the multitude of backgrounds that make Chicago feel like home. Many of my friends have roots from all over the world, and I have been privileged to experience their traditions. My best friend, Amir, is Palestinian and a practicing Muslim. In 2019, he invited me to attend a Palestinian wedding. Having only attended Greek weddings in the past, I did not know what to expect. I was astounded by the unique beauty of the wedding, from the ceremony to the traditional attire. I met many wonderful people and engaged in conversations with attendees who hailed from all over the world. Through this experience, I learned the importance of connecting with individuals who may not share my beliefs, and to embrace and celebrate the differences that make us stand out. ","My Greek Orthodox background has given me a unique perspective on life. I have always been involved with the church, and my life is irreversibly rooted in Greek culture.

Through my church, I discovered Habitat for Humanity. In this organization, I traveled to underserved areas of the Chicagoland area and participated in something larger than myself. My favorite aspect of building these homes was the opportunity to meet the families we were helping. I enjoyed talking with them and hearing their stories and was proud to give something back to individuals in need. My involvement in building these homes may have been a small contribution to an otherwise large project, but each nail and brushstroke was more than material to me.

At the dinner table, my father would often describe medical cases he saw in his clinic that day. These discussions inspired my initial interest in medicine. When I was fourteen, my freshman biology instructor, Mrs. Jackman nominated me to attend a summer hospital observership. This experience at Summit Hospital in Oakland exposed me to medical care in an urban setting. During the program, I had the opportunity to spend time with pathologists in the hospital morgue. I found the various techniques for identifying the cause of death fascinating. They showed me the distinctive cardiac tissue scarring of a man who died from a heart attack, the darkly stained lung tissue from a chronic smoker, and the large nodules covering a cirrhotic liver. In college, while shadowing a general surgeon at Johns Hopkins, I witnessed a seriously ill woman who had developed necrotizing fasciitis of her abdominal cavity. The surgery team kept her alive by removing the affected tissue and providing antibiotics. It is that confluence of scientific knowledge and the practical application of medical therapies that has always interested me. I want to be capable of a deep understanding of human anatomy and physiology to improve patient care.
In high school, as a TA for the computer lab, I realized I had a strong interest in computer science. After graduating from Cornell University, I joined the electronic medical record company, Epic Systems. As a technical analyst, I instruct nurses, physicians, and clinic managers on how to effectively use Epic’s software. I fly to outpatient clinics across the country to help them roll out their new system. The electronic medical record makes the practice of medicine safer and more efficient. We can automatically notify providers about drug allergies, unsafe medication interactions, and allow physicians to review medical records entered by their colleagues from across the country. This reduces the need for duplicate lab testing and imaging, which reduces unnecessary costs. Additionally, I have worked with physician IT champions and chief medical information officers whose understanding of both clinical care and technology allows them to improve the electronic tools providers use. 
The Covid pandemic has obviously presented many challenges for everyone. It began during my senior year at Cornell. At that time Cornell focused on ensuring lectures and tests could continue online but the university eliminated personal time with faculty. I reached out to other students in my courses and arranged study sessions. Working together greatly reduced isolation and helped all of us better understand the coursework. While working at Epic, I have been promoted to train newly hired employees. I enjoy sharing what I’ve learned with them so that they can provide support to other medical facilities. 
My father is one of two fluent Spanish speaking primary care physicians in a large medical center in Contra Costa County, California. Nearly 20% of the population in Contra Costa are native Spanish speakers. Patients who speak only Spanish frequently rely on friends or family to translate their medical history and care instructions. During my hospital shadowing experience, I saw firsthand tremendous improvements in patient understanding and treatment compliance when care instructions were given in the patient’s primary language. I hope to be able to provide medical care to the large Spanish speaking population with language fluency and cultural understanding. 
I developed an interest in medicine at a young age. I have followed an educational and occupational path that has prepared me for medical training. I believe it is possible to further improve both the quality of patient care and its accessibility. This will require future medical providers to utilize compassion, scientific understanding, and technology to optimize healthcare. I hope that I can help to make this happen.","I am Puerto Rican. My grandparents were born in Puerto Rico and my father was the first person in his family to attend college. I feel very strongly that ethnic and cultural diversity is important in medicine. Chicago has a large African American population. As someone who is also a member of a minority group, I know what it means to be underrepresented in medicine. I am sensitive to patients preferring providers that represent their culture. A lack of ethnic and cultural representation leads to an environment where patients feel that they are outsiders within the hospital environment. I grew up in a neighboring city to Oakland, California which has a large African American community. I did a hospital observership in Oakland where I interacted with many African American patients, many of whom did not have health insurance. Unaffordable health insurance is an enormous inequity in our health system that needs to be addressed more effectively in our society.","My personal experience of moving to Wisconsin after college was challenging. I did so during the peak of the Covid pandemic, and I spent a great deal of time isolated. This was in part due to moving to a new state, and more critically, the Covid virus. Coupled with the extreme winters in Wisconsin, I spent far too much time isolated in my apartment. At Epic, I serve as a mentor to new hires. Most newly hired employees to the company are recent collegiate graduates, like I was. After my experience, I take care to encourage that the people I mentor develop professionally while also building a strong social support network in and outside the company. The training and work at Epic can be very demanding. Helping the newly hired employees develop strong social bonds in the area helps them build resilience.",,,1,I have not experienced any abrupt disruptions during my application for medical school due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2023,15627839,,28,Woman,USA,0,,0,1,"I came out as transgender when I was fourteen. In Kentucky there are very few therapists and even fewer speech language pathologists who provide care to transgender patients, and only one support group for LGBT youth (with low transgender attendance). I struggled to find a voice coach for trans adolescents in my area–the only available group coaching was an hour and a half away and didn’t have any members under the age of forty. Finding a SLP, therapist, endocrinologist, and surgeon was difficult as an adolescent, years of documented care was required to be treated. When I went through surgery I was one of the youngest patients and found receiving patient education from staff very  difficult to comprehend as a teenager whose world was in upheaval. Through all of this I as a teenager had to discover where to find care, how to become who I truly am, and attempt school and extracurriculars. Physicians and nurses see people at their most vulnerable, I know first hand how terrifying it is to be a transgender patient. With a medically educated dad and his economic support it was still a constant struggle to find providers and navigate the requirements for treatment.

I did not know what to expect but knew that I wanted to be on the frontlines. My first COVID patient was “Ana,” an older Hispanic woman who told me all about her life, family, and favorite recipes. I shared my own stories and held her hand for hours while we watched music videos on YouTube, talked about what makes the best tortilla, and our go-to Christmas cookies. As she struggled to breathe, I helped her lay prone. I knelt on the floor, and we prayed together. She was terrified from lack of oxygen; I was scared because we did not yet know how COVID spread. I stayed with her because, despite the danger, there was nowhere else I would rather have been than holding her hand.

The next night, Ana was trying desperately to breathe and could not speak. I sat with her all night. As my shift ended, she coded. At home, I was unable to sleep. Some experiences in medicine break down every wall we can build, yet these struggles are where I find my greatest passion for medicine. When I returned, she was intubated and peaceful. I called her family to update them, but her condition quickly deteriorated, and for a time she was the sickest patient in the unit. Three weeks later, I was there when she woke up — the first face she saw.

We all overcame huge hurdles to provide care during the pandemic, but the physicians caught my attention. They spent rounds doing their best to brighten the staff’s lives and to prevail over COVID. Physicians spent every moment researching COVID, trying to find ways to increase survival. Their investigative drive and agency to save lives helped solidify my desire to go back to school to become a physician. I needed the ability to do more for the patients beyond what my nursing license allows, to digest and implement new studies, be the team leader, and let my mind work.

I first became interested in a clinical career when I spent days under my radiologist dad’s desk, listening to him dictate in what seemed like another language. However, during my adolescence, my focus was derailed from academics to a journey of self-discovery. During my junior year of high school, I finally managed to come out as transgender to my family. In the years that followed, as I became a woman, I finally became myself. At first, there was joy, and then quiet acceptance. After a time, the “transgender” label lost its power, and I became simply — Charlotte. I had found out who I was, but I had to discover what being myself meant. My first two years of college were a time of discovery of who Charlotte is to me. By my third year of college, I felt settled and finally turned my attention back to academics. My grades skyrocketed.

As a nurse, I loved being the face of the team for the patients, the advocate that was on their side first. I’m motivated to become a physician to bring that advocates role with me to the head of the team. I kept seeking “to know.” During COVID, specifically I wanted to know the science behind proning a patient, to understand why patients were clotting, to anticipate what ailment might come next. For instance, I recall a patient I’ll call “Dory.” Her blood pressure was in the 200s and she was confused and hallucinating. For two shifts, I worked to get her blood pressure down, along with my dayshift counterpart. When I left my second shift, her pressure was finally down, but, when I came back, I noticed something was wrong. Dory had not urinated since my last shift, so I started by scanning her bladder for fluid. I could not find any. I noticed that the change coincided with the decrease in blood pressure, and I worried if she was in a quasi-hypotensive state. If it was affecting her kidneys, I wondered what else might be affected, so I reached out to the physician. I outlined my concerns, my reasonings, and what I thought might be wrong. It took Dr. P less than ten seconds to mention “renal artery stenosis.” From our efforts, Dory got the help she needed, and it reinforced that there was more for me to do, more for me to know. Caring for Dory, titrating drips, giving chemo, I had tasted the science of medicine and proved again and again to myself that I need the fuller breadth of knowledge that comes with being a physician like Dr. P.

As a future physician, my goal is to continue to serve my patients as a knowledgeable advocate. My own journey of self-discovery has highlighted that every person wants to be seen, heard, and treated like the person they are. In hospitals, patients feel sick and vulnerable; often, they are lying down, their beds nearly on the floor, as the team hovers over them. In caring for patients, I sit with them at their side, on their level. With Ana, I fought to keep her off a ventilator, staying beside her to titrate her oxygen, despite the dangers of the unknown pandemic. In caring for Dory, I had an intuition and advocated for her, and realized that I had a hunger for the knowledge that Dr. P so effortlessly displayed. I have cared for many patients as a nurse; now I'm ready to become a physician so that I can not only serve as a partner and an advocate for my patients but also have the knowledge to guide the team in finding and implementing the best treatment for my patients.","I have loved learning about cultures different from my own, caring for others. In my public health clinical course as an undergraduate nursing student my professor taught us something that I took with me into my practice. Dr. O‚ÄôConnor was a pillar within nursing and cared primarily for homeless populations and those in areas around Boston Medical Center. She taught me the power of a bed bath as a metaphor. The moral was to always see your patient as they wish to be seen, as a person with life experience and the ability for kindness._x000D_
 _x000D_
I have seen first-hand patients scared to receive care because of the cost, patients that do not fully understand their diagnosis or care plan, and fear over laws passed that will directly impact patients. As a transgender woman I look towards the courts with trepidation, as a future physician I look forward to providing care to my patients in an affirming and compassionate manner. _x000D_
","Singing bowls, scented oils, chanting, and ceremonial clothing are not what most people think of when they think of May 2020. Less so when people think of a nurse during the COVID pandemic. A nurse is first a patient advocate, even after that patient has passed away. Before my Buddhist patient was intubated, she asked that if she were to not wake up, would we help her priest uphold her traditions? I heard her request, and she died not long after she was intubated. I had her priest‚Äôs number and called him; I navigated a ritual for a culture I was unfamiliar with over zoom. _x000D_
 _x000D_
I was able to organize for the priest‚Äôs son to bring me a box of oils and clothing. The priest, the patient‚Äôs family, and her friends all joined the zoom call. I had never been introduced to a ritual like this and am honored to have taken part. While it was far from the perfect postmortem care she would have received outside the hospital were this not COVID, I did my best to advocate for her wishes. _x000D_
",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm. I distinctly remember volunteering in early March 2020 for the first COVID ICU in Boston at my hospital of Massachusetts General. While this time was difficult for myself, my coworkers, my patients, and their families, I am eternally grateful to have been a nurse during this time. I still harbor many memories filled with grief from holding the hands of those who were dying without their families. Calling their loved ones and trying to set up zoom calls immediately before intubation, the last time many families might see their loved one alive and I was the only person present. It was during this time that I decided to pursue medicine. My physician colleagues worked tirelessly during COVID to help their patients, to help staff members, and to look for anything that might heal. I was inspired by this dedication and am on the path to medicine with this medical school application. I am grateful to have been a nurse during the pandemic.",1,1,2

As we played games, he told jokes and shared stories about his children and grandchildren. When I inquired, Alvin explained that his chills were a side effect of his treatments for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. To temper the chills, Alvin microwaved a sock filled with rice and tucked it under his shirt. I loved this solution. As his health declined, I learned more about his cancer and continual suffering. My relationship with Alvin helped me identify my passion for helping those who endure chronic illness. This desire has continued to grow as I have seen individuals with ongoing pain suffer through activities of daily living. I want to be a physician so I can serve and advocate for those with chronic disease. 

After seeing Alvin’s rice remedy, I learned to sew rice bags. I started sewing during Sunday Night Football and by the end of the game, I had 25 bags to deliver to a local oncology clinic. My project has grown over the years. I have taught hundreds of people to make rice bags and have coordinated with pharmaceutical companies and oncology clinics across four states to distribute thousands of bags. Often on deliveries, I would visit with patients as they received infusions. I loved being in the clinical setting and watching physicians create treatment plans to address nausea, infections, and other side effects. Next to such dedicated physicians, I started to question if my efforts were making a difference. Around this time, I received a note from a patient who wrote, “Your thoughtful gift warmed my hands and my heart. Thank you. You will never understand its worth to me.” This note left me with a renewed sense of purpose. As I spent time in oncology clinics, I felt a need to serve patients with chronic conditions whose symptoms continually change and whose diseases may have no cure. 

While continuing to lead the rice bag project, I sought opportunities to work with others who suffer from long-term illness. As I shadowed physicians in different specialties, I saw that chronic disease is not always easy to treat. Like these physicians, I want to focus my training and efforts to work toward better solutions for patients who face limited treatment options for their recurring pain. My interest in chronic disease led me to volunteer with the Arthritis Foundation. As a project coordinator for the Arthritis Foundation, I helped organize the annual Jingle Bell Run. The event was a success by many metrics, but for me, the success came in meeting a six-year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. I noticed he sat alone in “Santa’s Workshop” watching others color and paint rocks. When I offered to color with him, he said that he LOVES to color and that he CAN color, but he could not hold onto a skinny crayon due to a recent flare in his hands. This young boy’s pain was debilitating, but invisible to others. I used an elastic to put four red crayons together which created a thicker hold for him. Then, he and I colored together. The realization that this boy’s flare would pass, but his arthritis would not, cemented my resolve to work for those with long-term disease to mitigate temporary and long-term disability. 

I became aware of the invisible suffering of those in the Latino community when I started working as a medical interpreter. I saw that language barriers and other systemic issues often lead to persistent adversity. Such was the case with Luz. The physician looked at Luz and said, “Stage five kidney failure.” Understanding his tone, but not yet his words, Luz waited for me to interpret. Tears flowed down her face as the magnitude of her diagnosis hit—she knew her life would never be the same. Sitting close and listening to her fears about the life-long implications of her condition, I reached out and held her hand. My heart broke for Luz, knowing she had many challenges ahead. I could see that her condition was directly related to lack of insurance and her personal distrust of an unknown medical system. Language barriers, access to care, and other societal roadblocks make life especially difficult for Latino patients and can affect receiving a timely diagnosis. I have tried to help those in Latino communities by translating medical literature for local clinics and canvassing neighborhoods to raise awareness of public health initiatives. I want to help advocate for better access to healthcare in Latino communities as I work with patients like Luz who require ongoing care. 

The image of Alvin shivering in 90-degree heat left a lasting impression on me. Cancer took Alvin’s life last Fall, but our time playing games anchored my desire to help patients like him attain a better quality of life. My experiences with Alvin served as a catalyst for working to ease chronic suffering through the rice bag project, the Jingle Bell Run, and interpreting. As I have seen the constant struggles of those with chronic disease, I have felt a greater pull to work as a physician to help make their lives better. I am eager to begin this path to become a devoted physician to both treat and advocate for those who suffer from chronic illness.","In Lima, I worked as a triage assistant for 200+ volunteers originating from various countries. When I accompanied 19-year-old Juan to the hospital, he bounced his leg and seemed overly nervous for a simple broken wrist. Having grown up in a village near the Amazon, this was his first time in a hospital. The physician arrived and asked Juan if he wanted him to consult a ‚Äúhuesero,‚Äù a traditional healer. Juan was relieved and grateful. This physician had a keen understanding of his patient‚Äôs needs and was able to combine the practices of modern and traditional medicine to help him._x000D_

Closer to home, my interpreting showed me that every physician treats diverse populations. Lack of insurance and a distrust of our healthcare system affect many in the Latino community. While one person cannot become an expert on every cultural norm, being sensitive to them can help provide better care. I am dedicated to the diverse student body and patient base associated with Rush Medical College._x000D_
","Making and sharing burritos with the most vulnerable population in Salt Lake City opened my eyes to the effects of societal and structural determinants of health.

One year into the Burrito Project, a project volunteer was touring a social services facility aimed at helping women who are homeless. On the tour, our volunteer told of her involvement sharing burritos in homeless encampments. When she left, Aly, the receptionist stopped her. Six months earlier, Aly was given a burrito. When she took the burrito, something in her changed. In her words, ‚ÄúI decided then that I could do better. I realized I was worth something. It was hard work, but now I have a job.‚Äù This story far exceeded any hopes of the Burrito Project, but it proves that even small services can have great impact on others.",,,1,"While preparing for medical school, COVID affected both my clinical exposure and service opportunities. Thinking restrictions would be short lived, I started working as a remote researcher for UCSF and studying to become a licensed medical interpreter.

Prior to COVID, I served as the director for the Brighter Horizons service program. When it shut down, I looked for new ways to help others. This is when I started the Burrito Project.

It was March 2020, when rumors spread about a novel virus that is so familiar to us today. As a medical scribe at Emory University Hospital Midtown’s ED, I was working on patient charts, sitting behind the charge nurse when she received a call from EMS en route transporting a patient in respiratory distress directly from the airport. We anticipated potentially the first patient infected with COVID on the east coast. Nursing staff and physicians donned personal protective equipment, holding an uncanny resemblance to astronauts exploring a new world, and carefully entered the patient’s room to administer care. Witnessing these moments of courage, at a time when little was known about COVID and no vaccinations existed, have profoundly inspired me to become a physician. Doctors are one of many types of front line workers fighting against medical threats to humanity in new and ever changing atmospheres. Watching these doctors brave the unknown, to take care of patients when nobody else could, was my call to action to become a doctor.
 
I believe that health equity and health literacy are crucial for patient care and for the public. At the hospital, we take care of a notable amount of patients who are minorities, and unfortunately, some experiencing homelessness. These patients frequently presented to the ED unvaccinated, with COVID-like symptoms, and were skeptical about the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccines. If they had the proper resources about the vaccine, their visits to the ED might have been avoided altogether. I have had the honor of working closely with Dr. John Lewis on two major projects that focus on health equity, literacy, and education. Coincidentally, only months before the pandemic began, one of these projects focused on spreading the word of health disparities through a layperson's health literacy startup called Emergency Medicine Remix. This began as a podcast centered on the social determinants of health and how they affect care in emergency departments and later, we created episodes with vaccination facts. At that time, I had not realized how important this work would become. 
 
As a founding member of Health Spoken, our second project, I worked closely with Dr. Lewis and a team of resident doctors to create an educational platform on health topics unfamiliar to the general population. Health is a hybrid language that changes constantly over the course of time and is often misunderstood. The complexity has been exacerbated by misinterpreted medical jargon, social disparities, and inequitable access to healthcare. Our mission seeks to break down the complexity of health into something digestible and understandable, to provide a better understanding of this universal language to patients and providers alike. This project has helped me realize how multifaceted healthcare is, especially for the patient. Each patient comes from different backgrounds and levels of understanding of health. As a future physician, I want to apply what I learned from this experience by adjusting my care to each patient and providing them with appropriate resources.
 
As a volunteer, I built houses with Habitat for Humanity at the Medlock 7 site for the Ervin family. The couple and their young child were eager to move into their home, slated to be completed at the end of the summer. The main cohort of volunteers I worked with were retired men with a passion to build. The house started with a slab of concrete in a field of dirt, and as the house was built into a two story structure, so did the camaraderie among us volunteers. This community service opportunity was a beautiful parallel to the physician profession. The wealth of knowledge I gained from my team was similar to how education in the medical field is passed on; from attending to resident and from doctor to patient. The volunteers, uniting to build the house, was similar to how doctors work with their patients to provide a plan of care. This experience helped me realize my passion in helping others, as I saw the joy of the family once the house was completed, and to know that they still utilize what I helped build. As I was hammering nails and painting walls for the welfare and benefit of the Ervin family, I imagined this is how it feels to practice medicine: to help others with all of the might, empathy, and conviction within me. I strive to continue to help people by going to medical school so that I can provide care to patients and enhance my tools from hammer and paintbrush to stethoscope and white coat.
 
The culmination of my experiences have given me a mission to pursue a career in medicine to serve people in their time of need. I have learned that care begins with treating the person before the disease, doing so with an open dialogue about health equity, education, and public health. My experiences allowed me to realize how essential it is for providers to exhibit empathy, tact, and patience to effectuate care that not only heals patients, but builds their trust in the medical profession.","When I began my undergraduate career, I was looking for a community where I could feel included. In terms of Asian representation on campus, the Vietnamese Student Association was the only organization available at the time. Though I was proud to be a part of an organization that celebrated my own culture, a group of friends highlighted how there is a lack of other Asian cultures represented as well. I had the opportunity to charter Pi Delta Psi Fraternity, Inc., the first Asian interest fraternity on my university‚Äôs campus. Our goal was to bring a voice to all Asian cultures on campus by hosting events to increase cultural awareness and establishing an Asian American office on campus. My role as vice president of the chapter was to communicate with other organizations in the Multicultural Greek Council, assisting me in learning about other cultures I was not familiar with. Overall, this experience helped me grow my respect in my own culture and cultures from around the world.","I believe that my personal goals align with the strategies to improve, especially with the focus on public health and providing health care at the highest level.

We realized that this complexity is exacerbated by medical jargon and hard-to-access medical research and literature. We are striving to create mutual health literacy, work hard to provide health equity, and build the people‚Äôs trust in the medical profession for all communities. My goal is to uphold our mission to pursue health equity by expanding this project, and if admitted, to include important conversations with fellow students and educate through the platform and reach more communities.",,,1,"When COVID initially hit in 2020, the grading system remained the same scaled GPA system and exams were held online using a proctored webcam system.

Early on, the journey into medicine defines compassion as something exclusively fierce and exciting. We’re drawn to role models within the field that are introduced to us by the gravity of their accomplishments. In our tangential exposure to compassion as we may see it in exciting situations, the experience of medicine becomes something measured by intensity. 
This was my impression when I began to complete my ride-along hours in Downtown Fargo to earn my EMT license. While I had always known that I wanted to work in medicine, I sought to establish an early relationship with the field in the most patient care-heavy manner that I could think of by involving myself in emergency medical response. Fargo, though far from a metropolis, functioned as an urban system with a steady flow of calls. After enough time, I acclimated to the rigor of dispatch, assessment, and report. Each emergency followed the same fast-paced appraisals, and every care handoff was precise, tailored, and organized. Enthralled with the balance of efficiency and adventure, I was eager to practice in the coming years. 
I carried my experience with me when I returned to college in Ripon, a town of roughly 7,000--stark in contrast to the environment that I had been both raised and educated in. Fargo’s service was fueled by urban emergencies, but with eight nursing homes and an economy driven by blue-collar work, Ripon aimed to serve a population that not only lived together, but also grew, aged, and suffered together. Ripon’s staff knew their patients and often, their stories. Witnessing these deep interactions ushered me into a new context of emergency care. I was captivated by the love that my coworkers expressed not just for the field, but to the community that had been their home for decades. I began to piece together the side of medicine that had escaped my attention; while urgency was present, there was an overtone of gentle patience just as strong as the fiery drive that I had previously known compassion to be. 
I found this mindset applicable to my life as a college student, too. I stepped into a new administrative role as an assistant residence hall director, tasked with overseeing the community-building activities and resource management offered to first-year students. This position combined the confrontation of sensitive situations and the responsibility of mentoring others in positions of authority. To my dismay, I found that Title IX violations were far from uncommon and needed an urgent response paired with an unconditionally safe space for a student to process aftermath–a philosophy that I encouraged in my direct management of these ordeals and in the guidance I offered to my staff of resident assistants. Balance between immediate intervention and warmth was critical, but mentally heavy on supporting resources. Learning to advocate for the students overcoming this challenge and the resident assistants that they turned to required the same empathy that I had seen in ambulance work, as the concept mirrored the culture that I so admired from the surrounding town. These actions served as a medium for cohesiveness and trust that made an unthinkable trauma one that my community could conquer. 
Despite my student status, I found myself as immersed in the town as I was in the college. At this point, I responded to a rare situation: a patient who had spent her entire life in the community had called 911 for the first time. When I arrived, I met Mary who, at the age of 96, was a completely independent member of her community. Unfortunately, she had fallen and needed help. After 30 minutes of lifting, I was able to offer her comfort in the form of a smile and a promise that we would be there again if she ever needed it. She gave my hand a squeeze and spoke a proud thank-you. Mary took me up on the offer, and as we grew familiar, I watched Mary’s health deteriorate, knowing that kindness was all that I could truly offer her. Finally, I received a call that Mary was febrile and incoherent. As we moved her onto the cot, she refused to let go of my hand. Dropping her grip as she shifted to the hospital bed, She mustered a familiar thank-you. I would find out from her obituary that she died twelve hours later, undergoing palliative care. 
The facet of compassion which inspired me to continue working in emergency response has persisted, but is enhanced with the patience that Ripon’s lessons have instilled in me. While caring for Mary, her constitution and grace humbled me as I discovered that I was powerless against her aging. I began my career as someone who fixed, and I am growing into someone learning how to heal. Inspired by Ripon’s sincerity, I am committed to creating an environment that is both familial and efficient. Ripon’s vulnerability is a key factor in creating a patient-caregiver rapport built on unconditional empathy. Such wisdom has taught me how integral multifaceted compassion is to establishing patient relationships, and reflects how much there is to learn on the path to becoming a physician.","While I come from an urban area, Fargo is a far cry from a metropolis. I took a job offer to work from Bell Ambulance in Milwaukee after I received my undergraduate degree and was met with a patient population that I had never encountered. I had experience in both urban and rural EMS prior to the start of my position, but I found myself quickly needing to acclimate to an altogether different population. Unlike the geographical isolation that I had seen in rural communities, those I serve in Milwaukee more often struggle with exposure to violence, addiction, and financial limitations with a deeply-rooted distrust in first responders and large medical systems. Learning how to communicate advice that promotes wellness without stifling a patient's experiences is a balance crucial to my patient-caregiver relationships and something I hope to continue developing as I work with a wider range of diverse patients.","COVID-19 posed unique challenges to rural Wisconsin healthcare which Ripon's ambulance service struggled to overcome in the midst of the pandemic. Ripon is situated a minimum of 30 minutes away from the nearest specialty care hospital and has a high concentration of geriatric high-risk patients that rely on its limited resources. Furthermore, many doubted the severity of the illness and the efficacy of the vaccine, resulting in vast influxes of incredibly sick patients. ICU beds filled up so quickly that soon, the nearest open rooms were in Chicago. Because our service is volunteer-based, many of my coworkers and I held other roles in the community and as public health resources, we corrected misinformation with our firsthand experience. Slowly, we began to see a higher effort in seeking testing or vaccination, and more caution of social distance. As those around us grew more conscious of their friends and neighbors, we worked through the pandemic as a community. ",,,1,,1,0,2

When I stepped toward the ball carrier, I felt my knee collapse underneath me. I knew immediately this was my last time on the football field. Up to this point, I already had an interest in science and medicine which convinced me to sign up for a health sciences class my senior year of high school. The second half of this class required us to shadow a medical professional for two months. As the first in my family to graduate college, I had nobody in my family to shadow, nor did I know anybody in medicine. My only option was to ask the surgeon who operated on my knee and hope for the best. At the end of my last post-op follow up appointment, I mustered up the courage to ask this doctor I barely knew if he would allow me into his world for eight weeks. Little did I know at the time that the timidly asked, “would you mind if I shadow you?” would change my whole life course. One wrong step in football practice ended up being the first step in my path to medicine.

Shadowing a pediatric orthopedic surgeon introduced me to the importance of patient relationships which, in turn, lead to better outcomes. I distinctly remember a young talented dancer, “Mary,” who came into the clinic with her mother to review her MRI and develop a treatment plan. Upon hearing the news that she was going to need surgery, both Mary and her mother became very anxious. They were both equally concerned about the operation itself, and the subsequent effect on the daughter’s dancing performance. The surgeon noticed their concern and alleviated their anxiety by answering all of their questions. He even drew out the procedure on the exam table so they knew exactly what was going on. The fear of the unknown is common when undergoing surgery and how the surgeon was able to ease the patient and her mother’s nerves through a simple explanation still resonates with me. A rough drawing was able to gain the patient’s confidence and lead to a treatment plan that everybody was on board with. This experience directly influenced my work as an EMT. I envision myself in the physician’s position, hoping to one day be able to lay out a treatment plan in an easy-to-understand manner that gives the patient confidence.

	As an EMT, I rarely get the opportunity to explain a disease process or sickness to a patient because that role is usually reserved for a physician. However, when I get the opportunity, I strive to emulate the surgeon’s approach to applying education in the treatment process. In a memorable patient encounter in which we were treating a diabetic with high blood glucose, the provider had left the room. Alone with the patient, she asked me why we were giving her fluids when she had been drinking Gatorade all day. I took this chance to use an analogy to clarify our treatment to the patient. I explained in this instance, that her blood is like a cup of Kool-Aid powder. The reason why it is important to drink a lot of water and why we were giving her IV fluids was to “dilute” her sugar and make it less concentrated. Similar to when you pour more and more water into the cup of Kool-Aid powder, the Kool-Aid becomes less sugary. At this time, I saw the “a-ha” moment click in the patient’s head. The patient thanked me for the explanation, saying people have always told her to drink water, but now she understands why and she will make more of an effort to stay hydrated. I hope one simple explanation changed her daily habits to avoid this problem in the future. I desire to be a physician equipped with the highest education and understanding of medicine to not only physically treat, but also to educate patients to get them involved in their treatment and live a healthier life.

On the day of Mary’s operation, I discovered comfort in the familiarity of manual work with instruments in the operating room. I also got to witness Mary come in with a ruptured ligament and walk out of the hospital the same day which still amazes me. Observing the surgeon replace the ligament reminded me of my personal experiences. For generations, all of the men in my family have been construction workers, so growing up I always worked with my hands. The tools used in the operation were very similar to those which I have used all of my life. That day in the operating room, I saw myself in the surgeon’s shoes. I realized that pairing my passion for medicine with the dexterous work I enjoy with my father is a real possibility.

I strive to be a physician who is able to help educate and work alongside his patients while performing the treatment at the highest level. I find fulfillment when I can pass on what I have been studying to a patient to promote their participation in treatment, give them a better understanding of what is happening in their bodies, and help them learn what they can do to live their best life. On the flip side, I love the technical aspects of being a physician that would allow me to marry my deep interest in physiology with my passion for working with my hands. I hope to be a doctor who is not only able to mend patients in the acute phase, but also to equip them with the power to take control of their long-term health through education.","I took a Contemporary African American Social Movements class in college which opened my eyes to the experiences of others in my community and the importance of discussing complex topics to understand those unlike myself. I took this class during the height of the civil unrest following the killings of George Floyd and Jacob Blake. The course took a turn to incorporate discussion on the current events resulting from the dangers Fred Hampton warned about in the sixties. These discussions bred powerful testimonies from my professor and classmates on the type of injustices they face today. I am thankful for my classmates' vulnerability in telling their stories to better understand the fear and uncertainty African Americans are forced to live in daily. I have learned that I will never fully understand what my fellow peers have to go through; however, I can choose to be an advocate for them and welcome spaces for discourse to lift the voices that deserve to be heard.","Working as an EMT has exposed me to the health disparities across socioeconomic lines in our current healthcare system. For example, I had an elderly patient who was extremely underweight, his catheter was filled with blood, and he had a large, untreated skin infection. His wife only spoke Spanish and explained to me that she and her husband were immigrants and had no health insurance or money for medical expenses. The patient was clearly in the condition he was in because of a lack of care due to finances. The usual procedure at my job is to collect a health insurance card or bill the patient as self-pay; however, I knew billing this family would devastate them, so we were able to make some calls and treat our patient for free. This situation made me wonder how many people are battling preventable illnesses due to financial troubles. I now strive to advocate for the disadvantaged and promote equitable healthcare for all who need and deserve it most.",,,1,"During my freshman year, we had to leave campus and continue school online with one month of school left. My sophomore year was more challenging, the whole year was online, and some courses became more self-guided. I had to retool my learning strategies to guide myself through some of the most challenging classes I have taken. I am grateful for this experience, as it has made me a better student. I was able to help my school during this time by COVID testing students and faculty for monitoring and making campus policy changes. My EMT job began at the height of the pandemic, which opened my eyes to the effects COVID had on my city. Most people we treated at the time were COVID patients, and it seemed like a never-ending fight. I am grateful to everybody I work with for persevering and pushing ourselves and our patients through the thick of the pandemic. COVID has motivated me to push through difficult times and has strengthened my desire to apply for medical school.",1,0,1

That was my journal entry the day I was sexually assaulted as a teenager. Now, I am fully recovered, and I choose to focus solely on using my experience to help others. The symbolism of the crocus flower helped me to heal. It is the first flower to bloom in the spring following dark winters--a reminder that brighter days lie ahead. It gave me hope that I too could bloom. During my recovery, I became passionate about helping others feel similar healing which became the foundation of my interest in medicine.

This desire to help people heal became more concrete while I was volunteering for my church in France. I encountered countless cultures and met people from over 100 countries, many of whom were in desperate need of care. 

A particular experience with Abdul, a refugee from Sierra Leone, deeply impacted my interest in medicine. The 19-year-old had witnessed unspeakable horrors. The Ebola virus killed his mother when he was 12 years old. A gunshot to his left shoulder rendered his arm unusable as he fled his country to escape gang violence. As a political refugee in a foreign country, he often suffered discrimination. Abdul felt emotionally, mentally, and physically broken.
 
One day, we were together when Abdul was racially profiled and kicked off a bus. He became very emotional, and I took his hands in mine and cried with him. After some time, I noticed that his fingernails were long, cracked, and dirty--completely understandable for a physically disabled person living in a refugee camp. I found clippers and cut his fingernails. After finishing, Abdul looked at me and tearfully uttered, “this I needed, this I needed.” I valued this opportunity to comfort my friend, but I wanted to do more. I wanted to heal his dangling arm. I wanted to stop diseases like Ebola from killing more of his family members. This further fueled my desire to become a physician with the training to expertly heal people like Abdul.

Driven by my desire to engage in the broader battle against sexual assault, I work with a sexual assault research team that confronts the issue from an academic and legislative level. I am learning how to become an advocate for this vulnerable population. I helped uncover a faulty prosecution method where officers informally called legal officials one-on-one to decide if a charged suspect should be prosecuted. This was leading to many cases going unprosecuted. I was proud to be part of the team that exposed and abolished this faulty method and helped implement a system where far more parties were involved in the decision to prosecute. The small part I played in implementing these positive changes taught me that protecting vulnerable populations is a team effort, and there are many ways to assist. 

Seeing these changes in my local community gave me the desire to assist at the state level as well. During a legislative session, I lobbied legislators on several bills relating to sexual violence and health policy. I was thrilled to play a minor role in the passing of a bill providing broader contraceptive medication access to prison inmates. 
 
Although research and activism are essential in protecting and advocating for vulnerable people, their need for individual, face-to-face care haunted me. Thus, I became certified as a sexual assault survivor advocate. I was trained to support survivors in the emergency department alongside forensic nurses and physicians. One night, I was called in for a 15-year-old girl who was violently raped by her father. The chilling memory of that young girl’s betrayed, shocked face is etched in my mind, along with her clear need for one-on-one care and empathy. I watched as the skilled healers attended to her and even made her laugh. She said that thanks to them, she had hope. My interest in medicine solidified as I witnessed the invaluable nature of individual care.

Further entrenching myself on the front lines of treatment, I became a scribe in the emergency department. I had the privilege of witnessing compassionate individual care delivered to vulnerable populations. One night, an Indigenous American family wept over the body of their mother, who had succumbed to COVID-19, while a transgender patient battled mental illness in another room. On another occasion, a dejected Hispanic teenager brought in her own father, who had attempted suicide. Seeing others experience such pain and vulnerability makes me grateful for the essential researchers, legislators, and advocates who aim to alleviate such struggles. But in these patients’ moments of anguish and darkness, no study, law, or movement can replace the individual care of an empathetic, skilled physician. 

Like the symbolism of the crocus flower did for me, I want to help people heal and bloom. Though there are many vital ways to accomplish this, my broad desire to help others heal has narrowed to my goal of becoming a physician. Caring for vulnerable people on a personal level is my passion. Physicians are uniquely positioned to provide irreplaceable individual care and compassion, and I desire to cultivate the expertise necessary to help people heal and bloom in this personal manner.","Two years of living in cities with diverse populations like Paris and Brussels taught me how to adjust to urban life and prepared me for Chicago. But more importantly, while volunteering in these metropolises, I met people from over 100 countries and befriended individuals from all corners of the earth. _x000D_

An experience with my friend Manjula from Sri Lanka was particularly eye-opening. One day Manjula and I were almost hit by a truck driver who ran a red light. Without thinking, I expressed how reckless of a person the driver must be. Manjula looked at me and said, ""In my country, we do not think like this. We think maybe the driver's child was in the hospital."" This experience taught me the pitfalls of always attributing behavior to personality traits and the importance of considering situational factors. The lesson has been especially pertinent while serving marginalized communities. I aspire to care for patients with this balanced perspective.","While living in Paris, I became close friends with Yassia, a man from Burkina Faso. One of the most intense experiences of my life was when Yassia told me he was considering suicide. He faced extreme rejection from his family after revealing he was gay because In the culture he was raised in, homosexuality is strictly taboo. The situation was daunting partly because we grew up speaking different languages and were raised on separate continents. However, I was determined to help my friend and we had a heartfelt conversation. I tried to convey as much love and compassion as possible. Fortunately, Yassia decided to seek professional help, and he was eventually able to overcome his suicidal thoughts. Though he is doing much better, there are still challenging moments, and we often FaceTime to help him process his emotions. I am grateful to have impacted Yassia by playing a small role in helping him forgo suicide and remaining part of his support system.",,,1,"An experience stands out from my time working as an ED scribe during the COVID-19 pandemic. One night, after battling the coronavirus, an Indigenous American woman took her last breath with her family beside her. I wanted to comfort the women's distressed children so badly, but before I could do anything, one of them pulled me into a tight hug. This embrace was impactful because, to me, it symbolizes the need for connection during difficult times._x000D_

Striving for this connection on a global level, during the pandemic I volunteered for The Mali Wellness Foundation, a humanitarian group serving the Malian community. I wanted to positively impact these West African people during the pandemic. Thus, at group meetings, I advocated for bringing COVID-19 vaccines to Mali. Gaining approval was difficult but we willed our way to permission to bring the vaccines. The approval process exposed me to barriers in global healthcare but also showed me the possibilities of global collaboration.",1,0,3

It was humbling to learn about the many sacrifices these children and their families had to make to find comfort in a lifestyle they were constantly adapting to.  While shadowing at the neurology clinic, I met a teen who belonged to this cohort. When asked how she felt her urinary management was going, she shrugged her shoulders and claimed to be indifferent. Her solemn expression and avoidance of eye contact indicated otherwise. From her body language, she might have been emotionally suffering but didn’t feel like she was in a safe and comfortable space to express it. After all, here she was in front of a physician, parent, and a stranger close to her own age, being asked to describe what is normally a private matter. After a moment of silence, the teen bravely opened up about her struggle with functional incontinence and the immense stress and embarrassment it brought her in social situations. A few weeks later, I had the opportunity to meet this patient again in the urology clinic, and my heart felt full to see her so excited to learn about catheter options that would give her a part of her life back. This moment made me realize that communication between patients and physicians goes beyond words, and that what is not verbally shared by the patient can be just as important as what is. I learned the importance of a physician being able to provide a supportive, non-judgemental space so that patients may feel more comfortable to share the uncomfortable. 
I am intrigued by the complex physiological mechanisms that underlie health conditions, and I am also excited by the opportunity to translate this information in a meaningful way to patients. As part of the molecular muscle physiology lab, I had the opportunity to discuss scientific literature through weekly group meetings and one-on-one discussions with the principal investigator of our lab. We would take this time to evaluate researchers’ experimental design, data analysis, and purpose of the research. I had the opportunity to hear from a variety of perspectives–including other undergraduates, master's students and postdoctoral scholars. Understanding that I had limited background knowledge, the more experienced lab members would eagerly explain unfamiliar concepts in terms that aligned with what we had already learned in classes. Through their explanations, and by openly encouraging us to share our own thoughts, the more experienced team members made me feel valued as a team member. This experience exemplified the value of meeting someone where they are at. Just as I had felt valued in the lab, I want a patient to feel like their contributions to our discussions about health are worthwhile.
My research experiences have also driven my desire to provide evidence-based care. In lab, I had the opportunity to observe the life cycle that research undergoes, that starts from an idea that questions the efficacy of standard protocol and that might end in an alteration in the way a physician approaches their care. We focused largely on cancer-associated muscle and adipose tissue wasting. In addition to understanding the pathophysiology of this disease, we also considered how the timing and severity of this wasting across different genders and body compositions affects patients’ survival outcomes and ability to complete everyday tasks. It was in discussing these findings that I discovered my favorite part of the research process, asking “How are the findings clinically relevant? Can they make a meaningful improvement in a patient’s ability to live their life?”. This passion to understand how these questions are addressed has led me to pursue a certificate in Clinical and Translational Sciences.
Watching the doctors interact with the teen patient, I learned how a physician combines compassion, keen observation, and active listening to empower patients to share their experiences. In the lab, I learned how effective teamwork involves personalized teaching so that patients develop confidence to ask questions about their health and that they feel in control of their health decisions. From both research experiences, I gained an appreciation for the research process and learned how to critically analyze scientific literature. These experiences exemplified skills that I am motivated to continue developing as an aspiring medical student and physician.","As I screened patients for COVID, many African American males had voluntarily mentioned that they had not and were not planning to receive the vaccine. I will admit that upon first hearing this I was frustrated. I began to research the topic of vaccine hesitancy and came upon the Tuskegee experiment. I am appalled that such a study was conducted on these men, that broke every principle of bioethics- the harmful intent in withholding treatment for syphilis, lack of disclosure to patients about their condition, and the fact that was a particular attack on African Americans. Many of these patients‚Äô parents and grandparents would have been alive to witness this atrocity. Reading about this topic opened my eyes to a part of medicine that I was not yet familiar with. I must evaluate my own shortcomings and educate myself first so that I can be effective in educating others and be proactive in fighting systemic racism as a future physician. In doing this, I can lead by example. ","I was a marching band section leader in my senior year of high school. I bonded with each student and built trust, so that they felt comfortable asking me questions and reaching out for help. In the end, I was just another teammate with some advice to share. I held many one-on-one practices when official band practice was over. The night before competitions, I would call my bandmates to ease their nerves and hype them up. I worked with a freshman who was struggling mentally; she confided in me that she had autism and we worked on a plan to improve her confidence and capitalize on her abilities. At the end of the season, she wrote me a beautiful letter with an amazing drawing of her in uniform thanking me for supporting and believing in her, and described how she felt she had grown personally; I‚Äôve brought it with me to college to remind myself that my words do reach others, if I ever begin to doubt myself. I recently found out that she too became section leader in her senior year!",,,1,"At the onset of COVID, all students were sent home to finish the remainder of classes. Many of the lectures were recorded, which has been very helpful for my education because I often need to listen to explanations of concepts multiple times in order to fully integrate the information into my schema. However, it has also been isolating, as there has been a lack of discussion sections since the beginning of online learning, and it's been difficult to collaborate and get to know other students outside of class as most students have taken courses remotely. Without the in-person learning and discussion sections, I feel that our professors have only gotten to know us through office hour meetings, but they have not seen how we interact with others or actively participate in class. At the same time, I have had the opportunity to work at a dental clinic, do research, and lead my student organization, so I was still able to develop educationally, professionally, and personally.",0,0,1

On the three-hour trip home that day, I flashed back through all of the memories I shared with my grandfather. One that stood out to me was the first time I saw the long pink scar that ran down his chest while swimming at the lake. The scar, served as a constant reminder of all he had been through, while simultaneously representing the life-saving treatment. I realized my grandfather's surgery had changed my life just as it had changed his. I began to realize that all the times we stood side by side casting our fishing lines into the water would have been impossible without that surgery. On that drive home, my desire to become a physician was sparked as I knew I wanted to heal patients just as the doctors had done for my grandfather.
As I began exploring my interest, my first shift volunteering at a free clinic was later that year. I nervously called “T” back from the lobby to obtain her vitals and collect her history. Entering the bare room and sighing in distress, she informed me of her long-standing history of hypertension and a recent struggle with excruciating headaches. Slowly releasing the air from the cuff, I documented her blood pressure. T begins telling me how she is a single mother, battling depression since her teenage son passed away in a car accident. Teary-eyed and smiling, T told me how much I reminded her of her son because of my demeanor. I could tell most of her stress was dissipating as her posture straightened. Once the doctor rechecked her blood pressure it was near the normal range. I knew that even though she was in pain thinking of her son during our conversation, T was glad someone was there to listen. I could only assume that through our conversation, she was able to better process her son's death. As overjoyed as I was that I could make an impact as a clinic volunteer, I wanted to be able to do more to help T’s physical and mental conditions. I knew as a physician, I would be able to diagnose patients like T and provide the care that they deserve.
On a beautiful day during the following summer, I was setting up a glucose monitoring booth at a community health event in rural eastern North Carolina. “Joe” was approaching our booth and I could tell he was curious yet hesitant. As Joe was reading the sign, he mentioned never checking his blood sugar and never visiting the doctor. To encourage him to establish care, I gave him a pamphlet that had several phone numbers of local doctors’ offices. To ease his nerves, I demonstrated how the test was done on my finger. With a small smile on his face, Joe sat down and extended his hand allowing me to prick his finger. He let out a huge sigh of relief as I showed his blood sugar was within the normal range. Walking away, Joe and his wife were discussing which office they would call while flipping through the pages of the pamphlet. From this experience, I realized the importance of taking the time to make a connection and establish trust with a patient. As a physician, I aspire to continue to improve the health of patients in underserved areas while also educating and comforting them on their path to improving their health.
In my last year of college, I started Railcare’s first mobile clinic in my area. I squeezed and pricked “Pedro’s” finger, collecting enough blood to place into the Hepatitis-C testing vial. Through conversation, Pedro mentioned he was not established with a physician because he was unemployed. When I saw the line indicating the test was positive, my stomach sank. Although it was my first time delivering news like this, I knew that I could get him the help he needed. I could see Pedro’s fear melt away as I explained I would connect him with free treatment. Later that week, the center updated me that Pedro was receiving antiviral treatment. While I was thrilled to assist Pedro with getting the treatment he needed, I aspired to be the physician that provided that care. This further intensified my passion to become a physician because I desire to lead and oversee the long-term care of patients facing diseases like Pedro. 
I am continuously humbled throughout every patient encounter, and eternally grateful to be a part of the team providing them care. Thus far, my experiences have shown me that I can positively impact people's lives in a wide variety of roles. However, I constantly find myself longing to have the ability to do more for their care. I believe that, in addition to my constant involvement in the community, becoming a physician will expand my capacity and reach to make an impact through practicing medicine. The intersection of combining true human connection with the ability to practice medicine is where I aspire to place my influence. In the future, I hope to build upon my current skills to heal patients like my grandfather, diagnose and treat patients like T, educate and comfort patients like Joe, and provide long-term care for patients like Pedro.","Over my two and a half years at the Greenville Community Shelter Clinic, I have met many patients from diverse backgrounds. I felt the vulnerability in ‚ÄúGreg‚Äôs‚Äù tone and saw the fear on his face as he told me he had gone without access to healthcare or healthy meals for several years. Realizing it was not his own choices, but rather the circumstances that led him to develop diabetes. I knew at that moment that the only difference between Greg and myself was the series of things that were out of our control. I couldn‚Äôt help but think that I could have easily been in Greg‚Äôs situation with a simple flip of fate. I also found myself thinking that if Greg was insured, his diabetes could have been prevented or managed better earlier on. This signified that no one chooses to become ill, homeless, or poverty-stricken and everyone like Greg should have access to healthcare. My experiences like this one have furthered my passion to care for the underserved.","One experience that was very meaningful to me since my graduation was organizing the free mobile clinic that provided HIV/Hep-C testing and the connection to free treatment to the community. This mobile clinic led me to meet and provide testing to patients like ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù. I was relieved and excited to tell Dawn she was negative for both HIV and Hep-C. However, I think equally important was being able to give pamphlets with information on how to prevent these diseases in the future and discuss this with her. Many patients, including Dawn, were surprised to learn of the ways to prevent HIV and Hep-C. Providing this kind of screening and educational prevention, I was confident in its benefit to the community as it spreads the goal of safe practices throughout. I desire to bring this type of involvement to Rush Medical College and the community of Chicago‚Äôs west side and create a lasting change for patients in the community.",,,1,"As I left for spring break I was excited to continue shadowing Dr. Guo when I returned. However, during our spring break at East Carolina University, the COVID-19 restrictions took place.

2023,15661525,,23,Woman,USA,1,EO1,1,1,"We were living in Cicero, a predominantly Hispanic town outside of Chicago, until one day, shots rang outside our front door and a man ran through our yard to evade the police. My parents feared that the environment was not one that would support the life and opportunities they wanted us to have. This experience empowered them to make the decision to move. 

My family then moved to the suburbs, where we now faced a new array of challenges. Due to the higher cost of living, my parents worked multiple laborious jobs. I was eight when I helped my mom fill out her paper application to a local retail store. In high school, I started working to ease the financial burden on my parents. I had aspirations to attend college but I was worried about how to get there. I navigated the college process on my own as the educational system did not provide adequate resources for students with diverse backgrounds. I sought out and applied for free college test preparation and received a generous scholarship that provided me the opportunity to attend college. 

During college, I worked multiple jobs both during busy semesters and the summer to support myself financially. I am extremely grateful for the sacrifices my parents have made that allowed me to pursue medical education as these experiences have made me resilient.",U,0,1,"In my first week of college during my first freshman semester, I received a dorm conduct violation for writing on my friend's door decorations in the residence hall. I took full responsibility for my actions and reported myself to the resident assistant. I subsequently wrote apology letters and redid all door decorations for the residents. After the incident, I reflected on my character and did not want these actions to represent who I am. I worked diligently to earn a leadership position in the campus dorms. I learned the importance of integrity and that our immature decisions have consequences.

However, this was the reality for me growing up in a Hispanic family where English was not our first language. During this time, my mother was anxiously aiming to promote her new cleaning service by handing out flyers and my father was working paycheck-to-paycheck. My childhood encompassed many responsibilities including translating impossible doctor visits to my parents. Looking back, becoming a physician seemed like a wild dream. 

As years passed, my responsibility and the difficulties with understanding medicine for my parents grew. The most difficult was the moment my father came to me and handed me the papers that solidified his cancer diagnosis. The emotions are hard to encompass; even though I was not his doctor, I had to be the one to read what was written for his diagnosis. As my father was being treated, he shared a room with a man, “Mr. R”. I slowly introduced myself, and throughout time I came to understand that this man was afraid, alone, and confused. Just like my parents, he was an immigrant from Mexico with little family in the U.S. and hardly spoke English. Although the hospital offered online translation services, it seemed as though the interpersonal relationships with the medical team were missing which propagated the isolation that he was feeling. I felt a connection to him and reflected on all that I have been through with my own parents, including the physical, mental, and emotional struggles of being a first-generation child of Mexican immigrants in America. My interest in serving my community is personal and my passion for wanting to connect with patients like my parents and Mr. R encouraged me down the path to becoming a physician

Looking to advocate for my community and to bridge the language barrier between patients and physicians, I decided to volunteer as a Spanish-English Interpreter at a clinic for underserved and uninsured patients. Here, I met “Jon”, a middle-aged Hispanic man who had come in for a routine check-up. Having the privilege to interpret the conversation between Jon and the physician it became clear that he was struggling with untreated mental illness due to cultural stereotypes and a lack of resources in his community. For Latinos, “machismo” is a form of traditional gender roles where men are held responsible for the financial stability of the family, not showing emotion, and mental illness is seen as a weakness. The interaction taught me that while there are fundamental economic issues that prevented him from finding care, there were also other social, environmental, and cultural barriers that impacted his health. It was through interpreting appointments for patients like Jon, that it became evident to me that health is a complex combination of an individual's experience and identity. The experience I shared with Jon made me think of my own parents and how they struggled with the cultural barriers within their healthcare. The interactions I witnessed exemplified the need for physicians that display cultural sensitivity to connect with patients from different backgrounds, and I hope to use my experiences to improve healthcare for underserved populations.

My Latino Studies course also became an influential component of my desire to become a physician. I remember being frustrated when learning about the marginalization of Latina women that perpetuated mistrust between the community and physicians during the time of mass sterilization in the 1970s. This helped me develop a passion for women’s health and the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in medicine. Working in the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois Medical Center (UIH), I established my own research project to explore a variety of factors that influence the composition of gut microbiota and blood-glucose levels in expectant mothers from Chicago, as well as lead a first-author publication. Analyzing the relationships between blood glucose levels, food deserts, education, and economic stability, I saw the impact these SDOH had on perpetuating health inequity in lower-income communities. It became apparent that lack of preventative care access further contributed to healthcare disparities with patients taking an hour bus ride to receive basic obstetrics care at UIH. I believe research in areas of SDOH is a crucial aspect to address and understand the long-standing healthcare disparities and improve health equity for all patients. I aspire to not only use medicine as a gateway to connect with underserved communities but also to improve healthcare outcomes for patients with health equity research. 

My own personal experiences with my family, interpreting at a health clinic, and health equity research has contributed to my desire to become a physician. I hope to use my background to diminish the impact of language barriers on the patient-physician relationship. I have grown to understand how SDOH contributes to patient outcomes and want to establish trusting relationships with marginalized patient populations to promote equity and inclusion in healthcare.","Working in Chicago meant that I was sure to work with a diverse patient population. I remember, ‚ÄúTina‚Äù, Tina was from the South side of Chicago and came in for a women‚Äôs health exam. She said that she had not been to a doctor‚Äôs office in years due to inability to locate a close office, having been uninsured, and lack of time as she worked multiple jobs. Speaking with Tina, I realized there is never just one challenge that can prevent an individual from receiving care, but it is their collective situation and many social determinants of health (SDOH)._x000D_
_x000D_
Working with patients like Tina exposed me to the difficulties and disparities marginalized patient populations face. I realized there is a need to improve health equity, especially in providing resources for uninsured patients. My aspiration is to foster trusting relationships with underserved populations by considering all the SDOH that factor into their health and improve health equity._x000D_
","I interacted with a patient, ‚ÄúJess‚Äù, who came in with her child and only spoke Spanish. I felt connected to Jess, as I saw my parents' struggle in her. Understandin the burden that interpreting medical appointments can have on a child as I too had to interpret my parent‚Äôs appointments, I made sure to stay alongside her for her appointment. _x000D_
_x000D_
Jess was uninsured and inquired about lumps in her breast. I assured her that I would work with her to locate a free mammogram. I was able to find a location not too far from her that offered free women's healthcare services. After this instance, I worked to compile free or low-cost resources for future patients or even those that call to inquire about pricing. Through this experience, I have become more aware of the importance of advocacy for underserved communities, especially those patients who need help finding their voice in their healthcare plans. I aspire to continue to be an advocate for the Latino community as a physician.",,,1,"At the start of the pandemic, my dad began cancer treatment, and my family struggled financially. I worked more to pay for school and other expenses. Also, my experiences shadowing, Dr. Patel, and volunteering as a Spanish interpreter for uninsured patients was cut short.

During the COVID surge, we saw over 600 patients a day for testing. As the only Spanish-speaking worker, I spent a lot of time working with my community, the Latino population, to help translate COVID-19 test and vaccine education. I worked closely with physicians to create informational Spanish documents for primary care services. I realized that  physician mistrust in underserved communities continues to be an important issue in healthcare. It is important as physicians that we acknowledge the bias and the historic systemic racism that exists in medicine in order to help rebuild the trust with underserved patient populations.",1,0,3

He ran his hands through his hair, let out a big sigh, and put his pencil down. 
As the Instructional Assistant, I was reviewing the different types of HIV drugs with my undergraduates in UCSD’s AIDS Science and Society class. After handing out the weekly activity, I sat next to David who I noticed had begun doodling comics. I sensed that David was overwhelmed so I quickly thought of a way to re-engage him in the material. We began to draw the life cycle of HIV as a comic. As he drew, I asked him to explain how each drug could interrupt the disease progression, suggesting that we forget about the technical terms and simply focus on the treatments.

David drew and I listened; as he spoke, I could almost hear the gears in his head clicking into place. I was excited when David found the confidence to stand up in front of the class and explain the drug functions to his fellow students by replicating his drawings on the board. Devising creative methods to facilitate understanding in my students parallels the pedagogical aspect of medicine that I am so drawn to.  

My passion for medicine grew as I saw how the drugs that my students had to memorize became life-changing medications for many of our patients in the infectious disease clinic. I remember the day that Ana came to the clinic for the first time. As the medical assistant, scribe, and Spanish interpreter, I noticed her right away when she asked if she could fill out the forms in Spanish. She spoke with a cracking voice, avoiding eye contact in hopes that I could not see the tears on her face. She sat with her head down as if she did not quite belong.

Ana seemed about my age. Her accent and fear of judgment reminded me of when I first moved from Mexico to the US. I am no stranger to speaking in broken English. I, too, stared blankly at others as they talked, and wondered when I was going to feel like I belonged in a place I was supposed to call my home. It was precisely these familiar feelings that led me to become a medical interpreter—I wanted to make patients feel like they belonged.
As Dr. Haddad explained that Ana's HIV lab results were positive, I carefully interpreted every word into Spanish. When Dr. Haddad asked if she had any questions, she simply shook her head. I encouraged Ana to ask anything that was on her mind. She slowly raised her eyes and began to ask about the effects of the virus on her body and the side effects of her medications. When the consultation was finished, she thanked me and told me that she never thought that she would be able to see a doctor whom she actually understood—let alone one who made her feel seen and heard.

The four walls of Dr. Haddad’s clinic were the best classroom. Ana, along with many other patients, taught me that being an interpreter goes beyond exchanging one word for another. Interpreters must be patients' advocates and foster an environment where patients feel deserving of quality healthcare. Within those four walls, while the patients learned about their conditions and treatment options, I learned that being a physician means much more than diagnosing rare infections. It means calming an anxious mind, restoring dignity in a body that has given up, and spending time to care for someone who feels like they are alone in the world.

Perhaps the best place where I’ve learned to appreciate the intricacies that surround a diagnosis is the Eben-Ezra church on the rural outskirts of Tijuana, Mexico. Once a month, a group of 20 volunteers and I transformed the church into a free community clinic. The pews became the waiting area, the kitchen the triage station, and the office an exam room. Sonia was one of the regulars. She never missed a clinic as it was the only time she had access to medical care and medications. One month, she was unusually anxious; she had been losing weight and experiencing night sweats. As the clinic director, I stayed after everyone left to coordinate all the studies ordered by the volunteer providers. Sonia needed bloodwork and a CT scan to rule out cancer.

Seemingly simple tasks for patients with access to labs, imaging centers, and transportation were like solving a complex puzzle for those like Sonia who did not have access to medical resources. I worked alongside the community health worker to help Sonia get the necessary tests done. A sense of accomplishment washed over me when I called Sonia to share the results: they were negative. Serving as the clinic director for the non-profit International Health Collective sparked my interest in the social factors that contribute to patients’ health. 
I want to be a physician as the profession truly encompasses the matters that I aim to commit my life to: teaching, advocating, and addressing the needs of communities facing barriers to health. I aspire to tailor my approach to teaching my future patients in a way that best fits their needs, just as I did with David. I will strive to make them feel seen and heard, the way Ana felt when she walked out of the clinic, and I am devoted to working with underserved communities in hopes that one day, patients like Sonia will receive the care they deserve.","In family dinner conversations, every sentence contains a mix of different languages.

As an orientation leader, I worked alongside 17 staff members in helping incoming students transition into college. The staff was as diverse as the incoming class; we all had different nationalities, socioeconomic statuses, sexual orientations, and religions. This experience taught me that willingness to learn and being open-minded is vital to working with individuals from different backgrounds. At Rush Medical College, I am committed to practicing cultural humility recognizing that I am always in the process of learning and growing.","As a medical assistant at the Haddad Clinic, I noticed that although many of our patients had limited English proficiency (LEP), trained medical interpreters were not provided during their visits.

_x000D_

The rapid increase in COVID-19 cases, along with the closure of the border, made it challenging to continue running our monthly clinics in person.

Only minutes ago, I, and two of my friends, had carried another friend of ours into a humble hospital in the middle of rural Michigan. After a day at the beach, she became extremely dehydrated. Combined with a migraine, her condition worsened until it became obvious that immediate medical attention was required. As I sat in the parking lot, waiting for her parents to finish the ninety minute drive to the hospital, I realized that this day, and the role I played in it, seemed like a culmination of why I have chosen to pursue a career as a physician. 
Months afterwards, my friends would comment on the unwavering calm I unknowingly radiated as I sent one person running to get some sort of anti-nausea drug and then embarking on our journey to the nearest hospital, all within minutes of our friend's condition turning for the worse. This sense of calm has originated from years of standing in the middle of a Randori circle, a Hapkido drill in which multiple attackers circle a person and attack randomly. It had served me well before. A day entrenched in my mind is an afternoon at the Genesee County Free Medical Clinic when a beloved member of the clinic community arrived with a 178/82 blood pressure. As medication was quickly given, I was responsible for continually monitoring his blood pressure. I had taken blood pressures hundreds of times, but I fully realized that the stakes were now raised. Even so, I observed his blood pressure gradually decline back to normal as the entire clinic breathed a sigh of relief. As a pre-med student, these situations give me the confidence that I can roll with the punches brought on by medical emergencies, just as I learned to do on the Hapkido mat. 
As I continued to play the day back in my mind, I remembered the phone call I made to my friend's mother as I drove to the hospital. I asked if she would be okay with calling an ambulance. I heard the pain in her voice as she explained that her husband had just lost his job and that an ambulance would irreparably set them back financially. Before I handed the phone to her daughter in the back seat, still hunched over the plastic trash bag I had given her, the mother told me with a broken voice that I should continue to drive to the hospital. I recognized the tone in her voice. It was the same voice of the woman who limped into the free clinic with a broken leg, knowing that we couldn't fix it, but also being aware that she could not walk into the hospital and receive treatment if she wanted to eat for the next week. It was the same as the man struggling with alcoholism and depression who dragged himself into the clinic looking for any help at all, as he could not afford either medication or therapy. All of these individuals awoke in me the innate desire to do everything in my power to help improve their lives and provide high quality care when they often did not expect it. As the memories flowed through my mind, it was cemented in me that being a physician would allow me to serve a cause greater than myself and employ the calm and focus that comes naturally in tense situations. It would ensure that I could provide the care that those with the broken voices and worried tones needed and deserved for themselves and their loved ones. 
While I sat in the still silent car, a feeling of discontentment gnawed away inside. I had done everything I could, yet I still felt uneasy. Again, I recognized the feeling. A year ago, while I was home for the weekend, my mother called me downstairs and told me that it felt like her heart was racing and she felt uneasy. After I dug my stethoscope and blood pressure cuff out of my car, I found that her blood pressure was slightly elevated. Strange, but nothing incredibly concerning. But as I felt her radial artery pulse against my fingers, I could tell something was wrong. When only 45 seconds had gone by, I had counted 150. A few months later, she experienced an episode of stroke-like symptoms which she later described as feeling like lightning coursing through her body constantly. Countless trips to the emergency room later with no answers, my family was referred to Cleveland Clinic, where physicians were able to diagnose hyperadrenergic POTS. Simply being able to put a name to the symptoms she was experiencing felt like a breath of fresh air, but I was then able to witness these physicians work tirelessly to provide treatment and support. Most importantly, they were able to provide hope that life may just get back to normal someday. The calming presence, insatiable work ethic, and desire to do everything possible for their patients inspired me to further improve my own clinical skills. It fueled the desire in me to work harder so that future patients could have hope for tomorrow. They demonstrated to me that with growth and continued learning, I myself could be capable of being a good physician. The thought continually raced through my mind ""This is where I am meant to be.""
While I recognized that feeling of discontent of not being able to do more to alleviate my friend's condition, it reminded me of all the reasons I am a pre-med student and look forward to the day when I am able to fully provide treatment, calm, and hope to future patients.","Rounding the corner of the hallway for the first time that shift, I noticed the blinking call light of a patient‚Äôs room. As I knocked and entered the room, I was met by a bedridden elderly woman. Before I could ask what she needed, I was met by the exclamation of ‚ÄúNo man, no man, please.‚Äù I saw the fear and apprehension in her eyes as I quickly left the room and asked a female nurse assistant to assist the patient. A nurse familiar with the patient later told me that according to the patient‚Äôs culture, as a man, I was not to provide care. The nurse said that the patient appreciated my swiftness to get someone else to provide care in order to respect her beliefs. I will always remember the fear of the patient when I first walked into the room. It demonstrated that, even though she needed care, she was ultimately concerned with following her beliefs. It showed me that care must go hand in hand with thoughtfulness of a patient‚Äôs cultural and religious beliefs._x000D_
","Working at a free clinic in Flint, Michigan, I have witnessed firsthand the health disparities that plague the patient population. The effects of the Flint water crisis still grip a community in which a large percentage already live below the poverty line. Hypertension, diabetes, and depression are prevalent and many do not have insurance and are unable to find employment. In one instance, I took a new patient to a room, took his vitals, and asked him his reason for visiting the clinic. Staring at the floor, he told me of his severe depressive symptoms and the anger issues that came with them. He felt his life was spiraling. He could not afford therapy and was desperate for help. He spoke for twenty minutes as I sat, listening in the chair beside him. Weeks later, this man thanked me for putting him at ease in a place in which he normally feels uncomfortable. Thankfully, we were able to secure a free appointment with a therapist, assisting this man on his journey to a healthier life._x000D_

You are in a foreign place, the lights are blinding, everyone is in a rush, and the halls are filled with subdued crying. You pause and ask yourself, “Do I really need to be here? Will they even try and help me this time?” The vulnerability associated with admitting you have a problem can be crippling, especially when you have been told time and time again that “nothing can be done for you.”
     If asked ten years ago why I wanted to be a doctor, I simply would have said because they fix people. Both my grandmother and mother are registered nurses, and I vividly remember sitting around the dining room table listening in awe as they shared stories from their day. They spoke about performing CPR and administering many different medications, being sure to stop and explain to me what each drug did and why it was needed. I looked forward to these conversations because I was comforted in knowing my mother and grandmother were making a difference. In retrospect, my younger self was infatuated with the notion that being a doctor meant you got to fix people and help those around you. 
     It was not until I was a scribe in Dr. Gregory Kechejian’s office at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital Milton that I realized being a doctor is more than simply helping others. This realization came when I was in the clinic. We saw a patient who presented with Mondor’s disease, which is incredibly rare and predominantly affects women; however, in this case, the patient was a 25-year-old male who was utterly defeated. He had exhausted all options and was looking for help anywhere he could find it. While I watched the physician-patient interaction unfold in real-time, everything began to make sense. While it is true that doctors “fix” and “help those around them,” these phrases just barely scratch the surface of what being a doctor is. It is more than just treating the disease; it is about treating the patient, the person behind the disease. The patient is the priority. Dr. K knew this, and I was learning. I was learning what it meant to be a doctor and how to have the impact on others my mother and grandmother had on me. 
     When I applied to West Point, my grandfather sat me down and told me, “West Point teaches individuals to lead the world.” Initially, I struggled to understand this saying’s meaning; however, as time progressed, its meaning and relatedness to medicine became clearer. To be a good leader, you need to understand people. The academic, military, and physical rigors of West Point afford individuals like me the ability to reach our full potential as leaders by immersing us in an environment that prioritizes what matters – the people.
     While at West Point, I have had the unique opportunity to fulfill the position of Peer Support Person, responsible for supporting the mental health of 112 people through a network of behavioral health services. Focusing on the individual is imperative because the person looking for help is more important than the depression, anxiety, or stress they may be suffering from. I have hosted events and held many trainings aimed at improving individual mental health because no one should struggle in silence. This position has allowed me to actualize the lessons I learned as a scribe and become a better leader by providing the opportunity to know individuals not as conditions but as people. 
     Military leaders, including the former Command Sergeant Major of West Point, Ken Killingsworth, live by the saying that “the Army is a people’s organization, where the people are the strongest asset.” This same ideology explains why I want to be a physician, specifically a military physician - the people. Interpersonal interactions are a crucial aspect of medicine. Yes, there is a lot of schooling associated with being a physician. Yes, embarking on a career in medicine is a big commitment. However, the true commitment of someone entering the medical field is recognizing the importance of seeing their future patients as people. The Army’s central focus on people as their strongest asset epitomizes this mindset and is ultimately why I want to be a military physician. Putting people first and making sure those eight soul-crushing words never leave my mouth is how I will commit myself to being the best physician I can be. I recognize that I will not be able to fix everything, but I will strive to be there for my patients by providing support and quality care as Dr. K did with his patients. 
     Had I never met that 25-year-old man desperate for guidance in any form he could find, I may not have realized the true meaning of being a physician. I want to be a doctor who sits down with his patients like my mother and grandmother did with me, a doctor who listens to his patients like Dr. K did with the patient who had Mondor’s disease, and a doctor who prioritizes patient interactions because that is how I can “fix people,” how I will “help those around me,” and how I will prolong my infatuation with the medical field.","As a minority at West Point, I am fortunate to interact with people from Rwanda to Thailand, exposing me to various cultures. Living and learning with such a diverse group of people has taught me the importance of interpersonal relationships. I am aware that I will continue to learn throughout medical school because I will have classmates with different cultures and experiences than mine. Instead of inciting reticence, this excites me because I will grow as an individual. Every interaction has a lesson, and my worldview will broaden as a student. Immersion in organizations such as Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Milton has taught me that judgments based on physical appearance have no place in medicine. I have learned that biases must be addressed for communication and teamwork to flourish. My experiences as a minority in a diverse environment do not define who I am. Still, they are significant, and I hope to develop a community where differences do not impact perceptions of capability.","Historically, cadets at West Point struggle with their mental health during the winter. It is cold, the sky is gray, the buildings are gray, and coursework is challenging, deeming it the ‚Äúgray period.‚Äù While a peer support person, I attempted to get ahead of the impending mental health crisis and hosted a ‚ÄúBeat the Gray Event.‚Äù I wanted to foster positive thinking and bring joy to an otherwise depressing environment. I reserved West Point‚Äôs game room, ordered food, set out cookie decorating, and created a playlist conducive to socializing. I wanted to ensure that those in my company knew they had a community to rely upon. During the event, countless individuals thanked me because they were struggling and did not know how to ask for help. The last thing I expected was to be thanked, but I was relieved to see that I had impacted my community and helped those in need. I learned that the smallest actions have the biggest impact because, as people, we need to look out for one another.",,,1,"During the pandemic, my mother, a registered nurse, worked what seemed to be endless hours in the intensive care unit. When she did come home, with the N-95 imprint still bruised on her face, I observed firsthand the toll COVID-19 took on healthcare workers; however, instead of diminishing, my desire to pursue a career in medicine greatly increased. I wanted to be on the front lines, as dangerous as it was, helping in any way I could. I despised staying home and watching the pandemic unfold while I knew people were out risking their lives. I am hesitant to say I benefitted from COVID-19 because of the magnitude of hardships it caused worldwide, but I am aware that COVID-19 aided in shaping me into the person I am today.

2023,15679651,,24,Woman,USA,1,EO1,0,1,"Growing up in Peru, I recall my young parents taking me to rolling clinics, which were trailers with minimal staff that would park by underdeveloped areas of Lima. My dad was still a college student when I was born, and my mom moved to the U.S when I was 2 years old, so accessing healthcare was not particularly easy. When I move to the U.S at age 14, my mom was working at JC Penney and my sister was 5 years old. My mom received SNAP benefits on and off throughout my adolescence, and although the access to healthcare was reachable, the limits of my Medicaid insurance only allowed me to receive basic care. Eye and dental care were a luxury, and I vividly recall the day my mom saved money so I could get contact lenses. Having to save up to pay for the visit and for the contacts made me realize that something as basic as seeing, was considered a privilege. However, I don't consider these obstacles a disadvantage, because these experiences fueled my passion for healthcare equity and accessibility.",U,3,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,4663,250.0,3293.0,,440.0,60.0,1,3293,1,3793,06/24/2022,State University of New York at Stony Brook,Biochemistry; Women and Gender Studies,0,,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Less than $25,000",3,1,1,1,0.0,45.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,0.0,19,Significant,3,2023,2,3.0,0.5,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,"The smell of Vicks Vapor-Rub had always reminded me of the cold nights in Lima, Peru in which my grandma would sit next to me and rub my chest with the ointment whenever I felt the mild symptoms of a cold. Today, the smell of Vicks has a completely different meaning for me. At the height of the second COVID-19 wave, I was working as an EMT-B on a standby in Brentwood, LI, NY, when a call came out for a Charlie severity Difficulty Breathing. The dispatcher indicated this patient was COVID positive, so as the leading technician, I instructed my crew to gear up and wear our personal protective equipment. When we arrived on scene, a police officer was running out of the house, in his eyes I could see both a sense of urgency and relief as he put both of his arms together and signaled to me the CPR motion. Fear struck and adrenaline began to pump, I had been taught the chain of alarm for cardiac arrest for years, but I had never put it to use, neither did I think today was the day I would. I turned around and asked my crew member to pass me the AED. As I ran out of the ambulance I instructed the rest of the crew to pull out the stretcher and to call ALS, which is the Advanced Life Support crew. It all felt painfully long, time had completely stopped and every second felt like an hour. The sense of urgency increased, and as I walked in following the police officer a wave of menthol hit my face, my eyes drifted to the opened container of Vicks on the nightstand and then to the body on the floor. He was around 55 years old, I could hear his daughter scream in my native language from the backyard, which is all I remember. The Vicks, the yellow towel, the screams and him. 
    I felt dragged back into reality, and set up the AED immediately. My crew followed moments later into the scene, I could see panic setting in their faces which pushed me to keep my composure. I began by giving clear instructions to the police officers and my team: “Grab his arms, you grab his legs, and we will grab his waist while you hold onto the stretcher” I could hear myself speaking, but all I was thinking was about how this man looked so familiar. He looked like my uncles, like my granddad, like my own dad. He was so young, how did this happen, what even happened. Then it hit me, he was alone, went into respiratory arrest because of COVID and fell into cardiac arrest minutes after. In the face of a lack of ALS, we were forced to perform manual CPR on this man all throughout transport, alternating accordingly, anticipating the magic words “Shock advised, charging…” but they never came.
    The tragedy of it all hit me immediately after we passed off care. We had been on scene for 4 minutes, and transported him in 8, while it all felt like millions of hours passing by, in reality we were moving fast. Muscle memory took over my body, allowing me to perform what I had been taught with exact precision and outstanding timing, but it was not enough. 
    I always knew I wanted to help people, which is what mostly every sympathetic person has to say. It was the how that really troubled me, how could I help this man by becoming a doctor if he was already dead by the time he made it through the emergency doors. How could this have been prevented, I would wonder and ponder the same question over and over again. What could I have done differently, did I even do a good job. I had never truly grasped nor understood the importance of preventative medicine. The importance of managing and treating underlying illnesses, from the way a physician addresses the patient, to the physical care provided. The emphasis on preventing and treating illnesses before they make a patient a high risk for COVID mortality, was never a solution I had considered. In EMS, we care for people once an emergency has occurred, I no longer felt like EMS was the perfect way to help people as I once did. I now know how I want to help people, by preventing and reducing death and illness through treatment, trust and care, by helping them take care of their own health. Just like my grandma used to put Vicks on my chest, to treat my cold before it got worse, which always worked for me.","At the beginning of my EMT career I took care of a patient with severe foot ulcers, and after the call was over I felt the urge to research the reasoning behind letting a condition develop untreated for so long. I soon began to feel ashamed, for I had failed to realize the complex reality of healthcare accessibility. I decided to reach higher and expand my experience in different areas of Long Island. Soon, I felt my reality shatter as I saw what limited access to healthcare can do to a community, where treatable and chronic conditions were death sentences in the lack of proper treatment. After that interaction I decided to pursue a Masters of Public Health during my gap year, to learn more about issues impacting populations and communities to better myself as a healthcare provider. Learning about issues rooted in systemic oppression and how they impact the health of individuals was truly both devastating and illuminating. Assisting in that fight represents who I want to be and more.","I strongly believe in the impact physicians can have in communities by providing adequate, accessible and equitable healthcare. I have seen the power of fighting the social determinants of health alongside a community and individuals. As an HIV/AIDs peer educator I have seen the negative impacts of stigma, prejudice, homophobia and racism on a patient‚Äôs health. Many college aged individuals do not understand the need of getting tested for HIV/AIDS as they believe it‚Äôs a disease that does not affect them. This gap in education perpetuates cycles of oppression, in which a patient may not want to get tested due to fear of others judging them or due to mere ignorance. It is by educating others and spreading awareness that we can positively contribute to a patient‚Äôs health outcome. As a physician, I truly hope to leverage this by forming relationships with patients founded in trust, vulnerability and humanism.",,,1,"During the peak of COVID-19, it felt almost instinctual to seek ways to help relieve the burden healthcare workers were experiencing. I began to invest myself in pandemic relief, working towards preventing the spread by testing healthcare workers in facilities where patients were of high risk as well as transporting patients with COVID. At the same time I began to feel detached from schoolwork, and during the summer of 2020 I received a C- for a genetics class. Although I had previously faced struggles in classes, I had never received such a low grade and the feeling of failure pulled me back to a reality I had no longer registered. I began to question my goals and passions as well as my path, as the helpless feeling all medical staff shared intensified. I decided to pursue a masters in Public Health during my gap year. Doing so allowed me to re-encounter the reasons why I decided to pursue medicine to begin with, and fueled my desire to keep improving my academics.",1,1,2

As the country’s Director General of Health, now known as the Surgeon General, my grandfather established universities and created medical camps in remote areas around Pakistan. Every winter my family would visit him in Karachi, and I traveled to the camps to watch him provide care to communities in need. I had the privilege of seeing the love with which he provided medical services to people, the trust they put in their doctor, and their gratitude. Through the years, I saw children my age with far less access to healthcare than I had. It was something I had taken for granted, but never would again. It was in those Pakistani camps that my passion for providing healthcare and addressing health disparities blossomed. 
My experience in the medical camps shaped my thoughts on health equity. Even with access to the camps, the villagers lacked access to hospitals and routine medical care. I quickly learned that providing meaningful communal care meant addressing healthcare shortages. If I hoped to promote healthcare equality as a physician one day, I needed to understand the foundation for equitable resource allocation. Pursuing an economics degree has given me the intellectual tools to understand societal issues and how they relate to provisions of medical care. I hope to apply this knowledge in the medical field by working with patient’s insurance policies to find affordable and personal care options. 
Like my grandfather, I saw the value in providing care to underserved populations in my community. During my sophomore year of college, I interned at the Emerging Pathogen Institute in Gainesville, Florida. There, I assisted the program coordinator with implementing the FluMist Immunization Program. For the program, I went to all public schools in the county to teach about influenza and immunization. I assisted with vaccination clinics for hundreds of students who could not afford it, ensuring no cost by working with insurances and the Alachua County Health Department. Limiting disease spread at no or minimum cost is an essential part of communal health and providing such care is a challenge I look forward to tackling in my career as a physician. 
In addition to my work with the FluMist program, I had the opportunity to work in an established clinic in my hometown, Orlando. After COVID-19 left a local Gastroenterology clinic short-staffed, I stepped in as an administrative assistant. In performing clerical tasks, like scheduling appointments and shadowing, I grew to appreciate the nuance of patient-doctor interactions. I will never forget the time an older man walked out of his appointment, overwhelmed with tearful joy. He told me that the doctor’s life-saving diagnosis meant he would have more time with his granddaughter. Although this clinic was different than the camps in Pakistan, certain aspects remained constant. In both places, doctors worked diligently to diagnose patients; the responsibility, empathy and problem-solving that this kind of care requires is what I aspire to in my future.
What solidified my plan for a future in medicine was my work in translational research. In the summer following my sophomore year, I had the opportunity to acquire many useful skills by working in the Surgery Department Chair, Dr. Hasan B. Alam’s laboratory at Northwestern University in Chicago. Alongside some of the world’s most esteemed surgeons and resident physicians, I worked on a Department of Defense project studying the effects of valproic acid on traumatic brain injury. I learned hands-on surgical techniques and became certified to perform tissue cauterization, collect arterial blood gas and necropsy on large swine as a model for humans. My love for research followed me back to college where I joined Dr. Michael S. Kilberg’s laboratory. There, I worked to determine the potential cause of a relatively new inborn error of metabolism, asparagine synthetase deficiency, by investigating cultured cells. These experiences gave me the skills and ability to secure funding for my own independent research project. As a Research Scholar for the University of Florida Health Cancer Center this coming year, I will lead research on brain tumor therapeutics using the ketogenic diet. My experiences in translational research and passion to learn drives me to seek opportunities to improve patient care in meaningful and innovative ways. 
Seeing the impact of medical care around the world has inspired me to be a physician who works to provide personalized care and serve communities in need. Although my grandfather is no longer with us, I am determined to carry on his legacy of care for everybody regardless of circumstance. From my earliest memories in the medical camps until now, my goals have only become more clear: to provide care as a physician and promote communal health with empathy. My experiences in economics, clinics, and research have given me a well-rounded foundation for higher-level learning in the medical field. I am confident I have the skills and scholarly curiosity to succeed as both a medical student and physician who values healthcare equality.","Throughout childhood, I wrestled with living in my Pakistani culture at home yet wanting to fit into a predominantly white culture at school. Even so, my parents always made a point to ensure that our heritage remains prominent in my life. Over the years, my circumstances have made me courageous and have pushed me to learn from others unlike myself. As a result, I could empathize with patients of various ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses as an administrative assistant._x000D_
Today, I am the only woman and the only person of color in my college research laboratory. In my minority position, I have advocated for others. While studying an inborn metabolism error, I have suggested analyzing genetic variation across ethnicities to find potential variables. By addressing inclusivity in research, I hope to mitigate health disparities that arise due to a lack of representation. These are only a few examples of how I have used my circumstance to connect with others and advance the medical field.","I can contribute to these strategies by combining social and medical sciences. My coursework in economics has made me aware of social determinants of health and how they impact communities. Understanding the intersection of the economy and healthcare is vital to reducing health disparities. As such, I have taken coursework on insurance policies. With this knowledge, I will strive to provide optimal patient care based on unique plans. I am confident that my perspective on the economy‚Äôs role in provisions of care can reduce healthcare shortages in Chicago‚Äôs communities._x000D_
I have experience impacting my community through the Emerging Pathogens Institute. As an intern, I created promotional strategies to increase vaccination rates and promote health across Alachua County. I organized influenza vaccination clinics in schools and verified insurance claims so each child could receive an immunization at no cost. Advancing communal health is a goal of mine - one I aspire to execute in my career.",,,1,"Since I could not secure many shadowing opportunities due to the pandemic‚Äôs limitations, I adapted to find experiences where possible. I was fortunate to take an online course exploring various medical specialties. Throughout the course, I met many doctors in different medical fields and learned about their practices, work-life balance, and patient interactions. This experience effectively increased my exposure to the medical field while preserving my community‚Äôs health and safety. _x000D_
Additionally, I became familiar with clinical medicine by working in a gastroenterologist‚Äôs office. As an administrative assistant, I managed day-to-day operations, created a remote check-in system to ensure patient safety, and streamlined the transition to telehealth services by consolidating demographic information for the doctor. Although I will continue to seek safe patient interactions, I feel these were valuable learning experiences given the circumstances.",1,0,2

The rules were simple. While swimming at the YMCA, my siblings and I would take turns standing on top of our dad’s shoulders to see who could stay up longest.  It was just a game in a community pool, but it taught me a foundational life lesson: on the shoulders of giants we see the farthest. This lesson has inspired me to pursue a career in medicine.  Having stood on the shoulders of so many around me, I’ve developed a passion to be the shoulders on which others might stand, and I am convinced beyond doubt that the manner in which I can best do so is as a physician practicing compassionate advocacy.

Standing on the shoulders of my grandmother, I learned the fundamental importance of patient advocacy. My grandmother was an immigrant to the United States. A single mother, with six kids, little education, and no English, she worked as a seamstress to provide for her family. When a medical team prescribed too much anesthesia to her son, and ultimately killed him, my grandmother had no one to advocate for her.  She was left without reparations, without an apology, and without her son. My grandmother’s experience speaks to the obstacles that communities of color face in healthcare and the importance of patient advocacy in medicine. My grandmother’s experience taught me the value of physicians as advocates.  I hope, as a physician, to work with underserved populations and advocate for marginalized communities through cultural and social awareness in order to create equity in healthcare.

I stood on more shoulders as a biology student working as a scribe with patients on the east side of Detroit. In the classroom, I learned about the biological and sociological etiology of disease. In the emergency department where I worked, I saw how these etiologies collided within an unjust and inequitable social structure.  One day, a team of EMS workers entered the hospital with an older African American woman on a stretcher. Between a colostomy bag, COPD, and congestive heart failure, her arduous circumstances were quite evident. I was shocked when my coworker said, “They do it to themselves.”   This sparked a conversation in which I shared with her how unjust social structures biologically affect the underserved population of Detroit.  This interaction with my coworker inspired me to mediate access to health by delivering patient care more intentionally. I began to empathetically listen to patients' fears in the emergency department, and provide stickers and coloring books for children who had been waiting for a bed. I strove to create an environment in which the underserved population in the emergency department felt more than a check off the list; but rather, that they equally belonged, they were equally cared for, and they were equally heard. 

I stood on yet more shoulders as a researcher in Koshe, a garbage dump in Addis Ababa, home to a large population living in poverty. As part of a nongovernmental organization service trip to Koshe, I was moved by the need for compassionate advocacy for the women we served.  The women in Koshe have no choice but to work early mornings and late evenings in the garbage dump when they are left unprotected by government officials.  As a result, they are often victims of sexual violence.  This unsettled me so deeply that I initiated a research proposal to the NGO. The proposal was approved, and I designed and conducted interviews and questions for sexual assault victims that would allow for data collection. I then analyzed transcripts of interviews with 24 women about their experiences with sexual assault. From this research, I created an advocating analysis that offered holistic and institutional solutions to nonprofits.  While the research is pending publication, this process was transformative. It taught me how research and communication can generate creative solutions that help communities of color. 

On the shoulders of these giants – my grandmother, my patients, and the women of Koshe – I passionately desire to go to medical school.  Standing on their shoulders taught me life lessons that will allow me to deliver the most creative compassionate care for communities of color and other marginalized populations.  Standing on their shoulders has also reshaped my perception of what it means to be a doctor, to be a foothold for the community you serve. As a physician, I aim to support my patient population by creating and offering holistic solutions to assist in them reaching their fullest potential.  Medical school will allow me the opportunity to give to others what has so generously been given to me: shoulders on which to stand, and the support to reach their highest potential.","How to hug a lepper is not something they teach you at university. Nor are there any classes on how to be comfortable with ‚Äúgursha,‚Äù an Ethiopian tradition in which one feeds a friend by placing the food directly into the mouth of another. Such practices were not taught to me, but I knew that I needed to learn them in order to honor the community I was in._x000D_
_x000D_
In my first trips to Kore, Ethiopia I traveled with a nongovernmental organization to teach English. In working with people who collected garbage dump items for a living and lived in 10 feet by 10 feet homes, my vision of community was immediately broadened. I learned how to be comfortable with leppers and gursha. By learning to adapt to the community around me, I could also understand the importance of women‚Äôs safety when I heard women‚Äôs experiences collecting in a dangerous terrain. Like the practice of gursha, by identifying a cultural difference and humbly adapting to it, I learned to meet the needs of those around us.","In Kore, Ethiopia, women leave their homes at 4:00 AM to collect garbage in the community dump. They work in the early hours, not by choice, but because it increases their chance of collecting the dump‚Äôs most valuable items. However, it is the same early hours that increase their chance of experiencing gender-based violence._x000D_
_x000D_
These are the women included in my research study‚Äì the findings of which revealed disturbing accounts of harassment and intimate partner violence. Because of the socioeconomic position these women are in, few of them are able to find a job outside of collecting garbage. Without government support, it was incredibly difficult to offer tangible support to a community of women that had experienced so much hurt. However, my research was able to provide the empirical evidence that motivated an NGO to invest in the safety of women at the dump. Today, thirty girls from the community have learned taekwondo self-defense classes three days a week for the past year.",,,1,"COVID-19 regulations made traditional training opportunities virtually non-existent for months, but last fall, I was finally able to begin scribing. Serving the populations of both the east side of Detroit and Grosse Pointe, I learned that even a universal virus would have tragically different consequences in communities still facing structural violence.  For patients from lower socioeconomic statuses, their experiences as front-line workers and their long history of not being able to trust medicine revealed how strongly underlying social determinants of health created disparate results.  _x000D_

Running calls in the Tenderloin neighborhood involves heartbreak and violence. It is not uncommon for my patients to threaten, scream at, and spit on me. During a recent shift, I reversed an overdose (OD) and caught a jet of vomit in my lap. After swapping into a clean uniform, I resuscitated another OD. As the patient was thrust into painful withdrawal, he struck me in the chest. These experiences test my resolve, but they do not deter me. I am passionate about working with marginalized patients and serving the Tenderloin remains immensely gratifying. Small wins, however, including the lives I save, are overshadowed by the countless impoverished San Franciscans requiring medical care that I do not yet have the capacity to assist. 

To change the Tenderloin, and innumerable under-resourced communities like it, I need more than Narcan. My experiences in emergency medical services, local hospitals, and clinical research have underscored the demand for physicians who are invested in their community and the people who live there. Motivated by the individuals I have treated in prehospital contexts as well as the providers who have shaped my growth, I am eager to take on a greater responsibility for patients’ well-being as a physician. 

As a first responder, my interactions with patients in single room occupancy housing and temporary shelters have sharpened my awareness of social determinants of health. Digging out an unresponsive man buried under a foot of empty plastic wine bottles in a fifth-floor room evidenced the ways in which living conditions can reflect the severity of underlying disease and vitally inform treatment. Surprisingly, at the ER, nothing about this patient’s presentation suggested alcohol use other than my description of his room. Providers often want to see a photo of a car crash to visualize the force of the collision when determining patient treatment. However, ambulance crews are rarely asked to document the inside of low-income housing. The supplementary information I relayed enabled the emergency physician to identify a non-obvious factor and perform appropriate treatments more quickly. As the interconnected role of biosocial factors becomes increasingly understood, I am eager to deploy my nuanced training to assess and respond to the root causes of patients’ ailments. 

Additionally, serving patients in prehospital contexts has taught me that open-mindedness and empathy are essential for building trust with vulnerable patients and communities. This was especially apparent when I assisted an elderly patient, “Georgia,” who had been marooned for days on her soiled bed amidst heaps of refuse and without working lights. Georgia’s past experiences with the healthcare system had led her to avoid calling 911 despite debilitating abdominal pain. As I listened to her express her apprehensions and affirmed her decision to seek help, I realized the importance of positioning myself as an ally in patients’ health and treatment plans. Once at the hospital, I detailed Georgia’s concerns to the emergency physician, who not only ordered tests to understand her gastrointestinal pains but also mobilized non-acute, community-oriented support to facilitate a successful recovery. The personalized care I intend to offer as a future physician will center patients’ individual needs while also promoting health beyond clinical sites by attending to local context and concerns. 

In addition to lessons learned rendering care as an EMT, I gained new insight into the power physicians have to leverage medicine as a tool to reduce disparities during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Seeking to control the spread of a virus that further exacerbated health inequities in structurally disadvantaged communities, I conducted clinical research with physician leadership at one of California’s largest mass vaccination sites. By studying adverse vaccine reactions and measuring the efficacy of preventative action, we strived to improve confidence in the vaccine and encourage patients to return for future doses. Increasing access to vaccines and generating a quantitative understanding of severity and frequency of adverse events helped operationalize an effective local vaccination campaign and led to administration of over three hundred thousand doses in our clinic. As a physician, I look forward to participating in research that identifies and promotes actions designed to combat the unequal distribution of disease.

I have known the Tenderloin neighborhood since I was a high-school volunteer coordinating needle exchange and supplying free food and toiletries. I have a clear understanding of the patient population I want to serve and the motivation required to affect change. Medical education will build upon my ability to connect with patients and equip me with the skillset I need to make a deeper impact by targeting upstream health determinants. After balancing long and grueling ambulance shifts with self-directed study for the past three years, I am excited and prepared to advance toward my future career as a physician.","My professional life has facilitated a breadth of experience with a variety of people and cultures. As a result, I have a strong appreciation for wide-ranging perspectives. In China, I learned how to communicate and work effectively with my local colleagues. I also refined my cultural humility as I became familiar with linguistic and behavioral norms. As a salesperson in the U.S., I practiced active listening and empathy to build rapport with business owners across the country. In prehospital and emergency department settings, I have the amazing opportunity to serve individuals who speak different languages, require different care, and expect different outcomes from their healthcare experience. Despite the differences that exist between cultures, I believe there is an underlying humanity that we all share. My life experiences have cultivated my ability to uncover commonalities to build relationships and I look forward to further developing my ability to connect with patients.","After the murder of George Floyd, I had a conversation with a college friend about our former fraternity. We discussed the organization‚Äôs history and symbology, the physical space it occupied, and its contribution to institutional racism. We began a campaign to re-educate alumni and formalize support for the current students to disband the fraternity on campus and to give the space back to the school. Several months of networking, petitions, and phone and Zoom calls culminated in the resignation of hundreds of Davidson alumni from the organization and a house vote in which the current members tendered a formal revocation of the campus charter to the national fraternity.",,,1,"As an EMT, I experienced the rollercoaster of frontline healthcare work during the pandemic. At first, ambulance traffic plummeted, and I relied on unemployment benefits to pay for rent and groceries. At other points, I needed to recycle PPE, wear the same N95 for weeks at a time, and use mechanic‚Äôs gloves. When I was called on to assist with emergency tasks that surpassed my typical responsibilities, I learned the importance of flexibility in healthcare. I pivoted to administer vaccine doses at my county‚Äôs mass vaccination clinic and performed deceased testing.

Despite these difficult disruptions, I developed the skill of making friends and learned to establish roots in each of our new homes. I took comfort in the consistency in our family’s values, including service to others in the community and a love for knowledge of scientific wonders, especially those of the human body. 
I learned through example. My mother donated a kidney to a stranger in need she became aware of at a work function. She did not feel particularly heroic, and insisted it was the transplant surgeons who deserved the praise, as they were the ones who developed the skills to make such a miraculous thing possible. To my mother, it was just another way to serve others. Both of my parents’ examples influenced me as I developed a desire to pursue medicine as a career.
Another event that reinforced the value of service in my life was when I interrupted my education to be a service missionary in Tucson, Arizona. I served and taught the Spanish speaking communities living in and around Tucson. I visited children being held in border control facilities to offer toiletries or just share in a game of soccer. I learned to speak Spanish and found it thoroughly rewarding. I was motivated by my desire to genuinely connect with and learn of the different cultures of the people I was serving. I found that no matter what differences in customs may exist, all people benefit and thrive from real connections derived from honest and heartfelt communication. I learned patience and humility from frequent rejection and long hours of physical labor helping to improve the living conditions of those with very little material wealth. I even broke one of my front teeth while I was serving others by cleaning up a field. 
When I returned, I decided I wanted to continue positively impacting people’s lives. Obtaining my EMT certification began to fulfill this goal. The day I interviewed for a position with BYU Emergency Medical Service I had an experience that solidified my pursuance of a career in medicine. I went to my grandma’s house for the night to catch an early-morning flight home to Pennsylvania. While I was speaking to her, she mentioned that one of her biggest fears was having a stroke. I agreed that her fears were not unfounded given their unpredictable onset. A few moments later, my grandma suffered from a neurological deficit right before my eyes. Luckily, I recognized the signs of stroke from my training and called the paramedics immediately. They came and examined her and decided not to take her to the hospital that night. I trusted their decision but, subsequently and unfortunately, she had a massive stroke that would lead to her eventual death. 
My thoughts frequently return to that eventful night in Salt Lake City. I realized that in a crisis situation, people seldom rise to the occasion. They are more likely to sink to the level of their training. Luckily, my training was recent and I was able to recognize what was going on with my grandma. The episode helped me realize that physicians can do incredible things with their training to the benefit of others. The shared medical knowledge can enable someone to perform miracles due to the study and practice of the latest medical approaches.
Although health deficits due to age are inevitable, I believe there is value in striving against entropy. I feel that an important aspect of medicine is providing order to a system that wants nothing but to be chaotic. I learned from my experience recognizing my grandma’s stroke that, although death is inevitable, even to those we love, it is important and valuable to make a positive difference through compassionate care, especially in moments of fear and vulnerability. 
I have continued as an EMT with BYU since 2021 and worked hard to keep up with my training and protocols and have even obtained my Advanced EMT certification. It has been incredibly rewarding to help people in their most vulnerable moments. The trust given to a healthcare provider is something I never want to break. The lessons I have learned as an EMT so far have helped me to remember that each patient is an individual with a life story and needs, and not a lifeless practice mannequin.
I furthered my scientific pursuits by participating in research at BYU with Dr. Brad Berges. I investigated horizontal gene transfer in MRSA biofilm colonies. This research interested me given the emergence of ultra-resistant bacterial strains. I found it rewarding to dive into the existing literature to figure out ways to set up our own experiments. I learned quite a few lessons in patience and humility as I worked tirelessly to get my bacteria samples to grow properly. I also learned the importance of peer review as I met frequently with Dr. Berges and the other members of the lab.
My heart swells with compassion to serve and my mind thirsts to acquire knowledge. Every step on my path has led me to more experiences that have prepared me to launch onto the next great learning environment. I have no doubt that my calling in life is to become a physician.","My time as a missionary in Tucson, Arizona, helped me to understand the value and importance of diversity in team-driven efforts. The world we live in is incredibly diverse. Even the most homogenous communities can vary greatly in their beliefs and upbringing. As a missionary, I had the opportunity to work with other volunteers from many different places throughout the United States and even Mexico. Each of the missionaries with whom I worked had different life experiences which helped us to better serve the communities we were assigned to work in. I sincerely loved working with people who were not like me. This happened through finding common ground and developing real friendships with them. Inclusive excellence is the greatest way to work, and I am excited to be part of an institution that recognizes the value of diversity in the student body. I am capable of developing a rapport with anyone in spite of whatever superficial differences may exist between us.","A friend at BYU really enjoyed starting debates with me about LGBTQ people and their right to marry. He asserted society should only accept heterosexual marriages. I didn‚Äôt agree. Neither of us were ever swayed by the other, but we remained friends. We both served missions for our church and reconnected the semester we returned. While waiting in the car line for a COVID-19 test, this same friend with whom I had many heated arguments about LGBTQ marriage equality came out to me. He related to me that he had reflected about himself and his struggles with his own identity. In retrospect, I recognize that my own courage in speaking out on these issues and making others aware I am an ally allowed my friend to know that he was safe sharing this important information with me. This experience reassured me that, although I may experience some pushback from my religious peers on my stances about LGBTQ rights, it is worth it if I can help make others who are afraid or uncertain find comfort.",,,1,"Although the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were global in scale, I felt them most during my undergraduate studies. The first weeks adjusting to online lectures and socially distanced work areas were surreal. Most of my cherished experiences from my first year of college came from meeting new people from different backgrounds in my classrooms. Now it felt like it had been taken away and that the responsibility of hearing different perspectives rested upon me. Wearing a mask and sitting away from others made it easy to self-isolate. Life began to feel lonely since I often felt that it wasn‚Äôt safe to make new friends. I had to give up some of my hobbies like singing in choirs, but I redirected that energy toward service as a vaccinator and EMT. Reaching out and serving others was the remedy to the adverse effects of social distancing.",1,0,3
2023,15682633,,24,Woman,USA,0,,0,1,"Towards the end of high school, I started to develop IBS. Foods that I was once able to eat with no problem caused my stomach to make obnoxiously loud noises, though this also occurred on an empty stomach. I told myself that the noises only seemed loud to me because I was producing them, but that was quickly disproven when a student turned to stare at me after the noise went off during my first university exam. The anxiety I had regarding my stomach made it difficult for me to perform during exams which in turn affected my grades since they could count for up to 90% of my final grade. I felt helpless because it felt like I had no control over my body, but I also knew that nothing would change if I didn’t take action. It took me about two years of trial and error before I was able to understand my body.  I now know what foods to avoid, what brand of probiotics work the best, and what steps to incorporate into my morning routine. The thought of taking the MCAT used to terrify me because I had no idea how I would keep my stomach under control in a silent room for 7 hours. The fact that I was able to sit through it without any issue is a testament to how far I’ve come. My experience with IBS was a difficult process, but I am grateful that it allowed me to develop the fortitude to overcome future adversities.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,6627,175.0,76.0,181.0,0.0,86.0,1,257,1,162,05/26/2023,University of Chicago,Neuroscience,0,,No,No,Don't Know,"$150,000 - 174,999",4,1,1,0,0.0,65.0,10.0,10.0,9.0,6.0,0.0,7,Adequate,2,2023,5,4.0,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"I spent quite a lot of my childhood in and out of hospitals. My brother has sickle cell anemia which meant that he had to visit the hospital twice a month: once for a blood draw and another a few days later for a blood transfusion. As the little sister who insisted on doing everything with my brother, I accompanied him to almost every visit. At the time, I didn’t have a deep understanding of what it meant to have sickle cell. I just knew that hospital visits meant that I could play games with my brother for a couple of hours and later go into the toy closet with him to pick out something to take home. It wasn’t until my 21-year-old cousin Junior passed away from the same condition that the reality of the situation finally hit me.

From then on, starting at the age of 9, I began to view the hospital visits more pessimistically. I considered the transfusions to be the only thing that prevented my brother from sharing the same fate as Junior. My worries must have manifested in my behavior because it caught the attention of my brother’s hematologist. I remember one day walking through the hospital corridor to get a snack from the vending machine when, upon crossing paths with my brother’s hematologist, he stopped me and said, “You’ve been a lot quieter recently. Is there anything you want to talk about?”

I’ve always admired doctors; after all, the doctors at the hospital were always heavily involved in my brother’s care and made my entire family feel at ease despite the circumstances. That moment, however, completely redefined my outlook on the profession as a whole. The hematologist took the time to listen to my concerns, reassuring me that my brother’s condition was on the lower end of the severity scale and that the care he was receiving was keeping him perfectly healthy. When I considered his status as a physician and the trust that he had built up with me throughout the years, I couldn’t help but truly believe in his words. That moment helped me come to the realization that doctors do more than just treat the physical needs of their patients; they attend to the general well-being of those around them, using compassion to change lives for the better. This revelation set the course for the future that I’ve been working towards: to be someone like that hematologist who uses their position to make a lasting impact on others during the moments where they'd benefit from the support of a helping hand.

The first time I was able to put this aspiration into practice was when I mentored my former high school’s Mock Trial team. My experience with Mock Trial pushed me to build up the courage to find my voice and it is thanks to the club that I was able to become the person that I am today. I recognized how the club could act as a catalyst for personal growth, so I found it important to give back to help others achieve that growth. Club members would send me a message through GroupMe whenever they had questions, wanted feedback on their script, or if they wanted to have a quick call so that I could listen as they ran through their parts. At times it was difficult to balance my role as a mentor and as a student, but watching my mentees develop a greater sense of confidence in both their abilities and in themselves as people made that experience especially rewarding.

A year later I found myself working at World Vision International, a humanitarian organization whose mission of helping vulnerable children across the globe was something I deeply resonated with. I communicate regularly with project implementation leads to get a sense of how each project is designed to fit the health needs of the beneficiaries and synthesize this information into factsheets which are then distributed to external partners. Working in an international organization means getting comfortable with early mornings and late nights, but this is hardly an issue when I remind myself that these meetings work towards securing children's futures. My time at World Vision has allowed me to support global health services, but it has also expanded my understanding of the health challenges that stem from non-biological factors. In addition to my main tasks, I conduct digital health research where I spend hours delving into the health disparities of different countries such as the lack of a proper health information system in Ethiopia or cultural norms that discourage care-seeking in Uganda. It is up to the service provider to understand and navigate these challenges which I hope to be able to do in order to provide comprehensive care as a physician.

My desire to pursue a career in medicine has matured substantially since that encounter with my brother’s hematologist and with each new experience, my conviction grows as well. When I shadowed at a children’s hospital, I watched as the pediatrician interacted with the patients and their families, a natural balance between casual banter and medical expertise. It reminded me of the way that the physicians interacted with my family during our time in the hematology unit. Knowing just how much of an impact that interaction can have on a person, I hope to one day be in the position where I’m able to give others hope for the future in a way that sticks with them for over a decade, just as I had experienced.","At World Vision, I create reporting products to showcase the impact of the organization‚Äôs digital health deployments. We collect information by collecting data or having conversations with the implementation teams. Both methods, along with the digital health research I‚Äôve done, have given me an avenue to better understand the unique health challenges that occur in different parts of the world. The only way to become knowledgeable about these health challenges is to either experience them or to learn about them through external means. Through global health, I‚Äôve been able to realize that my own perspective of healthcare was limited to my own life experience. Understanding the social determinants of health that disproportionately affect medically underserved populations is the first step to addressing the barriers that affect their access to health services. After all, it is easy to misunderstand another individual‚Äôs illness experience if you only consider it from only one perspective.","Briana, one of my mentees, struggled with negative feedback; she'd roll her eyes or talk back whenever she received it due to her pride. Though not intrinsically negative, too much pride can get you into more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. It's difficult to recognize how damaging this mindset can be when it is prevalent amongst your peers in the school. The way people approach life is heavily dependent on where they live, so it is important to be cognizant of that to understand why other people act the way that they do. Whenever I had my one-on-one discussions with Briana, I would always nudge her into taking feedback more objectively. One day, I asked Briana to promise me that she‚Äôd listen to the coach‚Äôs feedback without retorting back to which she agreed. A few months later, I was at a reunion lunch with my former team and asked the coach about her. I was happy to hear that Briana stopped talking back and made more of an effort to incorporate the coach's feedback into her performance.",,,1,"In my first year of university, I quickly learned just how expensive school could be. In anticipation of future costs, I decided to continue working the following summer and planned to dedicate my last two summer breaks to medical experiences. That plan swiftly fell apart once the pandemic hit during my second year of university and I refused to risk being exposed to COVID because it would compromise the health of my high-risk family members. Instead, I searched for alternative ways of gaining clinical experience. I decided to explore virtual shadowing as it was a great way for me to safely observe real patient encounters, and it gave me the opportunity for me to examine cases from a physician‚Äôs perspective. With the improvements in case levels and as a new graduate, I‚Äôm now able to venture into clinical employment. I will be working as a scribe and clinical assistant for the next year. I‚Äôm looking forward to supplementing my virtual experiences with firsthand, in-person experiences.",1,0,1

I was observed like a hawk by medical students who saw me as a case study, rather than a child, while a back brace was roughly tightened around my tiny torso. Although the experience was difficult, I found myself deeply interested in the human body. While walking out of the exam room after an appointment, a resident who had observed the visit told me that he was impressed with the depth of questions I had asked. “You should go into orthopedics,” he told me with a smile. With this encouragement, I began to dream of one day becoming a doctor. 

My interest in becoming a physician grew after I became the leader of the New Jersey chapter of the Curvy Girls Scoliosis Foundation. I armed myself with information, determined to no longer be the invisible patient, but to become an active participant in my own health. I encouraged other girls to do the same: to speak up for themselves, to gain a working knowledge of the human body and become informed patients. When I traded my plastic torso for a titanium spine at the age of 16, the Curvy Girls rallied around me. I enjoyed paying it forward by visiting others in the hospital and encouraging younger girls through the process of bracing. We empowered one another, true, but in supporting a wide variety of girls, I witnessed tragic healthcare inequities: while wealthier girls could schedule their surgeries around school breaks and their parents could be confident that their child was receiving the best possible care, the girls from families from under-resourced communities were waitlisted at charity hospitals. As much as I enjoyed providing support to these girls, I felt as though I had not done enough for them. That same year, I took an anatomy course and fell in love with medicine.I felt a deep satisfaction when I correctly diagnosed the”‘patient” during mock rounds, dreaming about the day I could help someone the way my surgeon helped me. I realized that as a doctor, I would be in the unique position to advocate for the needs of patients and would be able to directly heal others--no other profession would bring me the same satisfaction.	
While volunteering at the Veterans Affairs Hospital, I discovered the immense power of empathy. In the ED, the veterans often arrived alone, with no one to help them process their pain and fear. At times I felt powerless, as I could only offer a cup of water or a friendly face and could not truly ease the pain of the country’s heroes. “Mr. Jones” was one such patient. He was screaming in pain and was unable to speak as I transported him to his scan. Thankfully, by the time I retrieved him from the scan, the morphine he had been given kicked in. “I’m sorry I was yelling before,” he told me. I assured him that it was no problem at all and we spent the trip back to the ED talking about our dogs. I covered him with a warm blanket, wishing that there was more I could do to help ease his suffering. Although my abilities were limited, I found that patients needed the friendly conversation just as much as they needed their medication. I now look forward to the day when I can provide not only comfort and truly heal the patients in my care. 	
When I worked as a medical scribe, my conviction to one day practice medicine grew stronger. I was inspired by the doctors who worked through the pandemic with an unwavering devotion to patient care. While I found my job rewarding, there were days when medicine seemed quite bleak as I listened to the physical and emotional pain of the patients. I often cried as I typed up SOAP notes. The world seemed so broken and grim at times, such as when 4-year-old “Lily”, a lupus patient, was infected with COVID-19. The rheumatologist, Dr. L., had advised her parents to vaccinate themselves to protect their high-risk child, yet her parents refused. When the parents were eventually infected, they cleared the virus easily, yet Lily was not so lucky: she was admitted to the PICU and after weeks of fighting, she succumbed to the disease. I was angered and heartbroken that a child died a preventable death, yet inspired by Dr. L’s response: he candidly but compassionately told each parent about Lily’s tragic death. Her story was a powerful motivator for other parents, many of whom softened their hearts and shifted their views on vaccination. While this was a horrible tragedy, I also witnessed Dr. L save many lives through compassionate scientific communication. I will carry Lily's story with me to fuel my devotion to patient education and preventative care. 	
Although I once naively thought that wearing a white coat would give me the superpowers to heal the world, my dedication to becoming a physician has not changed with learning the reality of the job. I cannot reverse time and change the surgical outcomes of my under-resourced friends, take away the pain from the patients at the VA, or revive those who died needlessly from COVID-19, but I can and will use these experiences to fuel a passion for patient care that is centered around compassion, dialogic communication, and education.","Growing up in the same home as my Deaf uncle introduced me to American Sign Language (ASL) and Deaf culture at a young age. While my mother, an ASL teacher, taught me and my hard-of-hearing brother ASL to bridge the two cultures in our home, the outside world was not accommodating: my brother refused to wear his hearing aids to school for fear of being teased, and his grades suffered as a result; I was often reprimanded by other hearing people for my ‚ÄúDeaf manners‚Äù--speaking loudly, tapping tables to get the attention of others, and my blunt descriptions. These actions are considered normal to the Deaf, but rude to the hearing. _x000D_
Although awareness about ASL and the Deaf community is growing, my uncle and brother frequently face systemic barriers. Navigating between the hearing and Deaf worlds has instilled in me a mindset of cultural relativism and a thirst for cultural competence, which has shaped my interactions and broadened my worldview.","In 2016, I nervously answered the phone to speak with the first member of my tenure as NJ leader of the Curvy Girls Scoliosis Foundation. ""June"" and her daughter ""Grace"" were distraught over Grace's recent scoliosis diagnosis, which required bracing. My nerves faded away as I realized that they did not need perfect advice, they needed to know that someone was going through the same thing. At the time, I was still wearing a back brace and was scheduled for spinal fusion. I hosted support group meetings, planned fundraisers, and visited members in the hospital. When I went to college, I stepped down from leadership, but kept in contact with the other members. Last May, Grace told me she needed surgery. I sent a care package with her favorite snacks and some toiletries, hoping it would bring comfort. A month after her surgery, I received a kind card from Grace and June, thanking me for my support over the years. I smiled, as my hopes were affirmed: my actions had helped a child in need. ",,,1,"In January of 2020, I was thrilled to learn that I had been offered an internship at Mount Sinai. The internship consisted of shadowing an orthopedic surgeon, assisting in the hospital wet lab, and volunteering in the outpatient office. In March, these plans came crashing down. I was bitterly disappointed, but I knew that staying home was the safest option. I took a job as a virtual medical scribe, for which I wrote SOAP notes for patients all over the country. I noticed that patients from underserved areas (such as rural Pennsylvania and Alabama) presented more often with severe COVID cases, and I began considering how poverty, education gaps, food deserts, and COVID-19 overlap, and realized that I would need to make equitable healthcare a goal of my future practice. The pandemic illuminated inequities that have always existed, and my experience working as a scribe during the pandemic inspired me to expand my mission to include advocating for systemic reforms to improve patient care.",1,0,3

Growing up with two parents as physicians, I have observed this throughout my childhood whether it was working on Christmas, performing surgery on the weekends, or getting woken up in the middle of the night to care for a patient. Being a physician is a 24/7 duty. In the past six years, I have begun to experience this more personally, transitioning from the child of a physician to participating in the care of others. I would like to share my journey and why I am so enthusiastic about becoming a medical student.

While in high school, I worked during summers as a physical therapy tech for a local orthopedic practice. It was my first experience involving patient interaction and care. I enjoyed getting to know the patients and watching as they progressed from struggling to step on a small pad to climbing large steps. I felt that I was actually making a difference in someone's life. From here on, I knew that medicine was going to always be a part of my life and I wanted nothing different. During COVID, I spent time in my local hospital’s lab as a tech, which gave me the opportunity to see patient care from a different perspective. The lab was a fast-paced environment, and I realized how every person played a critical role in patient care. While these last two roles took place directly in a hospital or clinic, I wanted to explore medicine in other capacities as well. During my last three years of college, I have been working for Notre Dame Sports Medicine as a student athletic trainer. In this role, I have been exposed to healthcare for the elite athlete from both an injury prevention and recovery standpoint. I love the idea of applying my training to offer patients guidance on how to prevent injuries from occurring.

While these experiences provided a cradle for personal growth and helped me develop important skills, such as communication and dependability, I want to have a larger role in patient care. While working in those aforementioned capacities, I found myself constantly wanting to know more about the patient and why they were experiencing their difficulties or why a specific treatment was chosen, often showering the medical staff with questions. I want to be with the patient from the start of their health journey and work with the patient to diagnose and then find solutions to their health issues.

Last summer, while shadowing an interventional cardiologist, I felt even more drawn to the physician’s role in medicine. There were multiple instances where the physician insisted I go home because I did not want to leave the cath lab. I found it fascinating to see the procedures being done and did not want to miss anything. To know that a person’s life was saved by placing a stent where there was a large blockage was incredible. The technology and skills required to save that person’s life are awe-inspiring. From this shadowing experience, not only did I learn from the cath lab but also from the office side of the practice. One of the most memorable clinic visits involved a couple and their vaccination status. Even though COVID vaccines had been available for months, they had just then decided to become vaccinated. The cardiologist spent some of the visit addressing their vaccine-related concerns and explaining the vaccine’s benefits. Though he did not have to, the physician did this because he wanted his patients to be fully informed in order to make the best health decisions for themselves. I want to have the training and knowledge to do the same and most importantly have a trusting relationship so patients can believe what I am saying.

I have enjoyed the insight and inspirations that I have gained as an athletic trainer, physical therapy tech, lab tech, and observer. These roles have provided the bedrock for the medical education and experiences I hope to gain throughout medical school and residency. The aggregate of these experiences and the intellectual challenges of the training fuels my desire to be a physician. Looking back upon my life so far, I cannot offer an incredible moment or an earth-shattering revelation about the desire to pursue medical school; the desire to be a physician has been with me since childhood. While my parents have certainly inspired me by what they do and encouraged me to chase my dreams, they are not the reason I am drawn to medical school. There are both advantages and disadvantages to being a physician; it is not for the faint of heart and requires a true passion to be successful. I have only continued to be inspired by my experiences, which have provided invaluable insight and opportunities to develop early skills, such as communication, compassion, and leadership, all crucial to providing excellent and effective care. I strive to become a physician because of the wide-ranging impact they can have from being a leader in the community to possibly being the only person a patient can turn to when they are ill, in pain, or simply forgotten. While I realize many talented candidates seek admission, I appreciate your consideration of my application for enrollment at your medical school.","Through my volunteer experience at the Women‚Äôs Care Center, where women can receive free prenatal care and counseling, I interact with families from different backgrounds. Most clients are from impoverished areas and seek guidance there as they have limited resources and nowhere else to turn. This past summer I assisted in teaching a parenting class. At first, I was nervous to participate since there is a bit of a language barrier with some parents and I cannot relate to them as I am not yet a parent. However, I reminded myself that despite having different backgrounds, we can all relate in feeling the same emotions, such as grief and happiness. By understanding this, we can connect with and make a difference in the life of any person we encounter. Once I recognized this, I focused on listening to the parents and finding opportunities to use what life experience I do have to discuss solutions with them. ","When I was a senior in high school, the track team‚Äôs throwing coach quit. This was hard because he was a great coach and knew the techniques so well. His replacement had never coached the field events before, lacking confidence and knowledge of the sport. In my senior year, I had a legitimate chance of placing high at competitions. However, I was no longer confident that I would get there without an experienced coach. As captain, I decided to step up for myself and my team. I watched videos of the technique and worked long after practice was over. Additionally, I tried my best to teach inexperienced teammates how to throw and helped the new coach gain an understanding of the sport. I showed my teammates how to do the drills and assisted them in perfecting their form. Though I did not do as well as I hoped at Regionals, I still did well considering my competition and circumstances. Additionally, the unfortunate circumstances were a good test of my commitment and leadership skills. ",,,1,"In December of 2020, I lost my uncle to COVID-19 quickly and unexpectedly.

Another challenge I faced due to COVID was finding a research lab to work in on campus. Most labs I contacted were at capacity and could not accept new students due to COVID restrictions.

Taking the risk to make a better life for his family, my grandfather embarked on a solo journey into the U.S., where he worked a variety of blue-collar jobs until he eventually was able to afford to move his family to begin a new “American” life together — a life that promised not simply prosperity, but rather the opportunity to achieve prosperity with hard work. In turn, his efforts provided me with the American Dream. If it were not for his selflessness and courage to take the risk to immigrate, I would not have the opportunities I have today. His altruistic actions instilled in me a moral standard to put others before myself, to work hard, and to act with courage. I intend to uphold these morals through whole-heartedly devoting myself to becoming a physician with a focus on family medicine.

After immigrating, before my grandparents stood a great challenge: assimilating into American life. They faced overwhelming cultural barriers and some prejudices. To a degree, I was shielded from these prejudices because my mother is of Irish descent. It was not until I was older that the blended cultures in which I was raised allowed me to realize the prejudices that exist. Often, when people would find out that I’m half-Mexican they would say condescendingly, “You’re Mexican?” or “Are you legal?”, as if I do not belong in our primarily white neighborhood. Conversely, when we go to family events on my father’s side, family often joke that I am too tall and white to be Mexican. I learned to become thick-skinned to any of these comments, but it left me with a sense of isolation. I felt as if I didn’t perfectly fit in either category. I was neither Mexican nor American. Now, however, my heritage is something I am grateful for. My experience growing up in blended cultures has rooted in me the importance of inclusivity and diversity. I have been made aware what it feels like to be both in the in-group and out-group. This has made me more self-aware of inclusivity and I now strive to make everyone of all backgrounds feel welcomed and heard. I am fortunate to be able to provide insight from being part of a combination of cultural ideas and aim to use my experience to support diversity and acceptance in my personal and professional life. 

My awareness of, and desire to increase, inclusivity combined with the work ethic, courage, and selfless mindset that my grandfather instilled in me, feed my passion to practice medicine. I have always been fascinated with biology and the complex interworking of the human body. Entering college, I was intrigued by the cellular, research level of medicine and it wasn’t until I began working in a hospital that I became more drawn to the personal level of practicing medicine. My sophomore year, I began working for the University of Kentucky hospital as a patient transporter and observed first-hand the difference that not only physicians make, but the entire healthcare team makes for the well-being of patients. I witnessed discharged patients graciously thank their nurses and physicians. I heard patients’ stories about how wonderful the healthcare team treated them through every step of their recovery. This led me to take a more active role in the healthcare team by obtaining my C.N.A., license and volunteering at the Refuge Clinic, a free clinic for people with little or no insurance. There I had the pleasure of observing patients from various backgrounds, many of which, like my grandfather, were immigrants who spoke only Spanish.

At the Refuge Clinic, I was impacted by one physician in particular, Dr. Perez. As a Spanish-speaker, he made the patients feel comfortable, treated each one with respect, and spent time to get to know them personally. Many of these patients have not seen a doctor in years due to cultural barriers and lack of insurance. Dr. Perez offered a welcoming hand to these patients, who long felt isolated and neglected by the American healthcare system. I was inspired by Dr. Perez who volunteered his time to treat these patients. I aim to become a physician focused on family medicine to help people from all backgrounds. Like the examples before me, I will strive to create personal connections to foster a high standard of care for my patients. I want to help patients like my grandfather once was, with little insurance and a non-native English speaker. 

I am beyond thankful that my grandfather laid the foundations for our family to be able to have opportunities that he could only dream of. His actions and examples have given me the courage to achieve my dream to be a physician. Like my grandfather, I plan to make the most of my opportunities and pursue my passions with determination to better the lives of those I care for, whether they be family or patients. I am committed to upholding my family’s drive for the “American Dream” in my journey to becoming a physician.","My father is Mexican, and my mother is German-Irish, so I was raised in blended cultures. This fostered a unique environment in which I was never completely ‚Äúwhite‚Äù nor Mexican. This made it difficult to fit in amongst my friends and family as I was seen as different by both, sometimes being the butt of jokes like my white friends telling me that I would be a great landscaper or my Mexican family telling me that I am too tall to be Mexican. However, these experiences gave me a deeper awareness of diversity and inclusivity. I learned that environments may be diverse but not necessarily inclusive, thus negating any benefits of diversity. With an understanding of the dominant and minority cultures in the U.S., I can contribute to the diversity of the learning environment at Rush because my culturally diverse upbringing allows me to relate to more people. I can use that to enrich the learning environment by presenting and advocating for diverse perspectives and promoting greater inclusion.","I volunteer at the Refuge Clinic which provides health care for the uninsured, many of which are immigrants and people of diverse backgrounds. It is disheartening to see countless patients stuck in a brutal cycle of not having enough money to afford health care, but their only source of income includes working conditions that worsen their condition. I aim to serve these populations that otherwise would be neglected in the health care system and to change the health care disparity in our communities. As a nursing assistant, I help my community by providing patient interaction and hands-on care. On the grand scale of the world, my impact may be small, but every patient we see is one patient who otherwise would‚Äôve likely never seen a physician. I intend to continue donating my time and efforts towards treating patients from underserved communities. Growing up in the Chicago area, I have a deep tie to its community which increases my drive to help Chicago residents achieve better health.",,,1,"The COVID-19 pandemic presented many unforeseen challenges. Personally, it interfered with my education as it switched to an online format. Although, I am grateful that I was able to continue classes, I believe it impacted the depth at which content was able to be presented. It also eliminated in-class connections with peers and professors. Additionally, opportunities to expand my studies were limited, such as having shadowing opportunities postponed. At work in the hospital, we were overwhelmed with COVID patients and the fear that we would bring the virus home to our families and friends. Despite the fears, isolation, and drastic changes to daily life that the pandemic brought, it did allow me to spend more time with family. More importantly, it also proved to me that I am resilient and adaptive. I was able to successfully continue my education and continue working in a health care environment. I believe that this resiliency and adaptiveness will help me succeed in medical school.",1,0,1

I was seated in the Mobile Health Clinic, finalizing patient lab results, when I heard a slight knock and the door of the clinic swung open. I looked over and saw a young Hispanic man enter sheepishly. I greeted him in Spanish, asking him how I might be of service for him today.  “Mi esposa ('My wife’),” he explained, “wants me to see a doctor. I told her it wasn’t necessary, but she is insisting.” I nodded and showed him towards registration.

His appointment went quickly. The physician finished the routine examination without concern, and the patient was directed to me for blood work. I performed an A1C to monitor for diabetes, a pervasive disease in the Hispanic community. We chatted until I heard the A1C machine beep. I glanced over and my breath caught in my throat. The screen displayed a number I had never seen: 14.0%. The glucose level in this man’s blood had maxed out the machine, indicating wildly out of control undiagnosed diabetes. 

For the next hour, the patient sat tearfully in the clinic as the physician explained the life-threatening consequences that this test result carried, his new array of medications, a string of nutritional advice, and seemingly endless recommendations for lifestyle changes. I listened silently, mind racing. An hour ago, this visit was casual, and only occurred because his wife had insisted. Now, however, it balanced life and death.  

It was in this moment that years of believing that I wanted a career in medicine changed to undoubtedly knowing that I must have a career in medicine. It was a humbling experience to be a member of a team that quite possibly saved this man’s life. Most impactful of all was the handshake the patient gave me before leaving. As he clasped his hands over mine, I could feel his gratitude, so much deeper than words could describe. “Gracias (‘Thank you’),” he told me, as I smiled with reassurance. I was left invigorated to learn, grow, and pursue my childhood dream like never before.

My initial exposure to the field of medicine began years earlier with my grandfather’s pancreatic cancer diagnosis. For me, the idea of death was a foreign one that affected other families, but never mine. This view was promptly shattered as I watched my grandfather quite literally wither away. I watched his mind cloud as he forgot his daughter, his grandkids, and his wife. I watched him lose control of his most basic bodily functions. To this day I can still hear him retching as the chemotherapy side effects plagued him. I can still hear my mother’s sobs when she found her father in his hospice bed in the living room, dead.

This experience planted the seed that would sprout into a dedication for a career as a physician. Despite the darkness that accompanied these long months, so too did light shine. I grew enamored with the flow of the hospital, and was especially drawn toward the compassion, confidence, and leadership displayed by my grandfather’s doctors. My family member was the grateful patient, so it was clear to me just how impactful the role of a physician is. They were the steady, unwavering hand guiding us through uncertain times. I knew that whatever it took, providing meaningful care to patients during their darkest times is what I need to do.

Inspired, I sought opportunities to explore medicine. I secured a shadowing opportunity with an orthopedic surgeon and was also invited to shadow with a renowned neurosurgeon. I remember walking into an operating room for the first time, seeing the seemingly endless racks of shining tools waiting to be used in a full knee replacement. I watched in awe as the surgeon and his team worked flawlessly together, eliminating the excruciating pain the patient had described in clinic not too long before. Despite my small role, I felt alive in the operating room and proud of the skills I was developing during clinical hours. The gratification of the patients that initially drew me towards medicine was omnipresent, and for the first time in my life, I felt that I was helping to create a positive impact on the members of my community. 

My desire to provide compassionate care led me to Family Health La Clínica (FHLC), where I worked as a bilingual Mobile Health Aide specializing in phlebotomy. My team and I traveled Wisconsin to provide free healthcare to underserved, Spanish-speaking migrant workers. With every one of the thousands of patients I served, I knew that my interest in becoming a physician was converting into a calling. My time with FHLC also challenged me with the rigor of healthcare. Despite the stress of caring for others during shifts that often lasted longer than fifteen hours, the experience did anything but turn me away from medicine. I was invigorated by the work, and learned what service truly meant: putting the needs of others above all else.

These experiences have fueled my need to become a physician, and every time I’m working in the hospital, I discover new motivation. I have watched countless physicians selflessly strive to improve the human condition with their leadership, and I know that there is nothing else that I would rather do with my life.","In 2021, I served migrant Mexican patients who were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their working conditions when COVID-19 began were horribly inadequate; their companies provided no masks, no social distancing rules, and no quarantine measures to protect them. They slept in barracks stacked like sardines with the infected dying around them. I was astonished to learn that the medical needs of this underserved group were being ignored, and that innocent people were paying with their lives. These patients opened my eyes to the inequalities faced in my own state of Wisconsin, broke my notion of equality in medicine, and cemented my need to pursue medicine after experiencing their healthcare needs firsthand. At this job, I learned so much about the Hispanic culture, improved my Spanish, and most importantly I improved my own cultural competency. I learned the need to learn about a patient‚Äôs culture to adequately understand who they are, what they‚Äôve gone through, and how to treat them. ","Starting my junior year in college, I participated in an organization known as Allied Fresh which focuses on eliminating food insecurity in Madison, Wisconsin. Every week, Allied Fresh ships in personal hygiene products and healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and meat to package and distribute to low-income members of our community free of charge. Volunteers like myself are responsible for delivering the supplies to the homes of clients, and I often provided Spanish translation for my group as well. Proper nutrition is a vital prerequisite for people to obtain before they can lead healthy lives and is a key building block in public health; growth, education, employment, and life grind to a halt without it. That is how I and this organization have impacted our community. Underserved community members who couldn‚Äôt afford to feed their families found new hope to grow and prosper, and perhaps one day leave poverty with the help of Allied Fresh.",,,1,"As I was about to begin research, volunteering, and joining clubs COVID-19 forced me to leave campus, causing many of my activities to lack longevity on my application. So, I had to search for creative manners to serve, and found remote work assisting my fellow Badgers. I began volunteering as an organic chemistry tutor and a peer diversity mentor working with struggling and incoming students. _x000D_

More than anything I wanted to spend time at UW-Health.

My physical and mental health plummeted to the point where I fainted in the middle of class. In the emergency room, I avoided conversating until the physician asked me what I looked forward to most once discharged. Overcome with emotion, I expressed my grief and conviction that life must be meaningless if a friend can die while simply on their way to school. He listened to me patiently and after talking, his advice helped me remember parts of life I still cherished like my grandma, whom I called Nanay (a Tagalog honorific). She was my roommate who held me when I cried, the hero that protected me when my mother got violent, and the peacemaker that taught my family to forgive. That brief interaction restored my appreciation for life and I found purpose in pursuing medicine to give others hope at times of defeat.

When I moved to college, I used this inspiration to get involved in the community and dedicated my time volunteering at both a local outreach clinic and the hospital. One day I was observing an infusion nurse put an IV on a man with colon cancer. He opened up to me about how he went from taking trips on his motorcycle and surfing to spending his days at the hospital recovering from bowel obstruction surgery. For the following weeks, I signed up to work every day to be there while he recovered. After a while, he was walking on his own, and by the time I arrived for my shift he’d light up and say “There she is!”. He spoke about how painful it was not seeing his son who was serving time with only 5 years left of his sentence and the patient feared he’d die before his son's release. He told me that he failed as a father and as a form of repentance, he let his health deteriorate, undergoing the procedures on his own to not be a burden to his family. With permission, I held his hands, wiped his tears, and expressed with volition that he was not a burden to me. On my last day at the department, I made him a card filled with drawings of the things he would be able to do once out of the hospital like surfing and meeting his son. While our goodbye was mutually emotional, the time we shared gave me confidence in my ability to understand the life of my patient beyond their treatment and acknowledge how their background may influence their health decisions.

Initially, I believed my clinical experience would be postponed due to the pandemic, but shortly after reuniting with Nanay, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. With cancer absent from both sides of the family, it was challenging for me to accept this reality. The early days of her diagnosis continued as normal with her happily cooking Filipino dishes and me joining her on walks. But, after her hysterectomy, she became too weak to do activities on her own. Sundays I dressed her in formal church attire and took her to the living room where our priest held service for her. At night, I laid awake for hours comforting her until she could fall asleep. The following months were progressively harder for her with chemotherapy, weekly paracentesis, and the limitation of one visitor each day at the hospital as COVID cases surged. 

I remembered the physician from my youth and used every opportunity to make her laugh, recall our memories in the Philippines, and reassure her that I was happy to be a caregiver. Although I had served patients in the past, taking care of someone that raised me and loved me was both immensely rewarding and painful. As I fed and bathed her, she praised my abilities and how proud she was of my clinical training. But when seasons changed and her treatments continued to fail, I found my skills to be insufficient and took time to educate myself on her condition by shadowing an oncologist. This opportunity gave me both insight into the disease and reassurance from cancer survivors. I remained optimistic and reminisced on my positive experience with the man at the hospital. Sadly this time, I wasn’t able to share a goodbye. 

When Nanay passed, it felt like I was 12 again, quietly standing alone over a casket as I filtered out the sounds of empty condolences. Buried in the same cemetery as Anahi, I sought solace by talking to them, but the silence just had me question my existentialism. Yet, once I returned as a volunteer at the hospital, I regained awareness of my long-term goal. Despite my loss, the chance to give a patient a reason to smile and to keep fighting gave me salvation. I accepted that even as a physician, my ultimate responsibility is not to save someone but to provide them with the best quality of life for the time they are with me. Every encounter is a chance for me to remind others of the value of their existence and that needing help doesn’t discredit who they are and their accomplishments. In return, I am entrusted with their stories and carrying their legacy through continuing acts of service. 

Even during difficult situations, life is not meaningless. I will be a doctor that treats others of all backgrounds and helps them remember the aspects of life they keep close to their heart. Whether it’s the exhilarating feeling of riding a motorcycle or coming home to a loved one, these motivate us to move forward and share positivity with those around us.","While working at the International Center on campus I led my own class under the English Conversation Program. This class gave international students a place to practice conversational English with the help of English speaking facilitators. Through icebreaker activities I learned about the different cultures and backgrounds of my students which allowed me to see life through their perspective. By considering the environment they grew up in and the beliefs they value, I gained patience and understanding, handling situations respectfully. When a student was offended by unfamiliar slang from another student, I calmly explained the terminology and meaning behind the phrase. By allowing the students to talk it out, they actually became close friends. Students also partook in presentations where they taught the class about their language, music, and holidays. I learned that by giving others the platform to share, they can fully express who they are and gain confidence in themselves. ","At my local outreach clinic I help not only individuals, but their families as well. We have a kitchen where we offer cooking classes and supply patients with the ingredients and equipment to follow along with us. By providing a welcoming space for others, we converse about culture, food and life. The most gratifying aspect of the classes is that those who attend can bring the food they make home to their families alongside ingredients to make the meal at home. The nutritious meals we make are easy to follow and we also incorporate lessons to talk about diseases such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Cooking a meal with someone can give a person the motivation and a hands on experience to improve their health. Those who attended our classes were even able to share what they learned with others. I will continue to advocate for more universal healthcare, targeting areas that are the most neglected and providing resources that are culturally sensitive and relevant for patients. ",,,1,"The pandemic was exceptionally difficult for my family as my grandma was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the same time. With the majority of extended family overseas, we were the only ones who could be there for her. Unfortunately, due to hospital restrictions on guests, we weren't able to visit her as readily when she was admitted. Since I was taking care of my grandma on top of adjusting to online school, I revised my plans for medical school and decided to delay taking the MCAT and take a gap year. This would additionally give me more time to save money for medical school so that my parents could fully finance my grandma's treatment. Once school became hybrid with online and in-person classes, I returned to university and periodically traveled to care for my grandma. When she passed, her burial was delayed a month after her death due to the many COVID deaths which made mourning very stressful.

It had only been a few days since his gastric bypass procedure, and hours of diagnostic testing at the medical center finally revealed the problem: a leak at the incision site. Though I could comprehend the post-operative discomfort that we were warned about, I was shocked at the magnitude of pain that could result from an error as minor as a loose stitch. 

I have been helping my father all my life, as obesity limited his speed and range of motion. In this situation, however, I felt utterly powerless. The surgery we anticipated with excitement, one that could change his life for the better, brought him the worst pain I have ever seen him suffer through--and I could do nothing about it. The potential to relieve people of pain and stop it from ever reaching this level is why I find value in the medical field, and why I want to be a physician one day.

Pain is a sensation universally experienced by humans that is wide in its scope. Aside from physical pain, one can endure the pain of uncertainty, the pain of being unable to progress, or the pain of failing when they have done all that they could. Pain in all its forms is what I believe robs people of their joy the most; it kills motivation, breeds anxiety and chaos, and makes us feel alone. I consciously avoided these experiences as an adolescent, which resulted in my refusal to pursue anything outside of my comfort zone and intentionally distancing myself from conflict of any kind.

Years later, sitting in the driver's seat of that car, I realized the futility in trying to avoid something that was integrated in human nature. Pain could inflict itself upon even the strongest individuals, the way I perceived my father to be. I now live in pursuit of a solution, rather than running from the problem. I volunteered in the most critical departments of the Orlando Regional Medical Center so that I could to broaden my perception of how pain can affect and present itself in different people. I developed an interest in research, recognizing its potential to optimize patientcare and overcome the plateaus that impede progress. The Interventional Robotics Laboratory was the perfect setting for this, since technology is becoming a powerful tool that can either drastically improve the lives of patients or increase the pain it was intended to prevent.

I have learned that the universality of this struggle represents an opportunity to reach so many people when they are at their lowest. This realization encouraged me to live every day trying to relieve others of pain in the capacity I was able, and leaving people even slightly better than the way I found them was a great success in my eyes. Physicians represent a population with one of the greatest access to people in pain. They have the versatility of technical experience required to prevent it, and work in an environment of confidentiality and trustworthiness that allows them to do so. Every doctor, in one way or another, is a pain specialist.

This vision gave me a purpose in pursuing medicine that was worthy of the struggles that accompanied it. Because of my ambition in high school, the timeline to complete my undergraduate studies was shortened to just over two years, already making it a demanding task to gain valuable experience. In addition, the COVID pandemic had interfered with my entire first year of university, making it difficult to gain involvement in direct patient care and interact with my peers and professors. Yet my determination to realize this future helped me overcome these challenges. I conducted research with the Interventional Robotics Laboratory and secured a teaching assistant position while in a virtual setting. I engaged in telehealth medicine to experience the interactions between a patient and provider during a time when physical exchanges were not possible. I knew the value of these experiences in my personal and professional development and their importance in achieving my ultimate goals, so I adapted to the circumstances in order to carry them out.

My father stayed that night in the hospital and underwent a follow-up procedure the next day. For a second time I saw the familiar wires and tubes protrude from him, hoping to one day understand the purpose of each. Though his unconscious state made him seem at peace for the moment, I was now fully aware of the struggle that would follow. At that point, however, there was nothing I could do except take my father home and hope he would recover quickly. One day, I want to be able to do more than just hope. 

The role of a physician goes beyond fixing bodies; they are ambassadors of mental, physical, and emotional wellness. I want to devote my life to preventing pain in all its forms from plaguing the lives of others, whether through the direct administration of treatment, the proper execution of medical procedures, or the discovery of more effective therapies. As one version of the Hippocratic Oath writes: ""I will prevent diseases whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.""","Every year, I serve with the Middle Eastern Christian Ministry in a project to distribute gifts to children who were admitted to the hospital during Christmas day. I prepare the packages with volunteers from various countries who speak many dialects of Arabic, and learned that having a common goal gives us motivation to overcome any individual differences that may stand in our way. When visiting each child‚Äôs room, I was met with a wide demographic of families which had different boundaries and perspectives that I accounted for when serving them. I acted as an interpreter for some of the volunteer members who did not speak English, and was often needed to communicate in Spanish with the patient‚Äôs families directly to explain our mission, allowing me to exercise all the languages with which I was familiar in a clinical setting. I learned that people may react to a situation based on their personal worldview, which must be considered to serve them effectively in their time of need.","Just before high school, my childhood best friend experienced a hostile divorce between his parents that disproportionately affected his well-being. The tension led to a decline in his mental health, and he was diagnosed shortly afterwards with bipolar disorder. Though I was unfamiliar with the condition, I was not prepared to let it destroy his future and quality of life. I made myself available to him whenever he needed, often waking up in the middle of the night to comfort him and alleviate his anxiety. His condition caused his performance in school to diminish, but my sense of responsibility drove me to support him through classes, tutor him in SAT mathematics, and ultimately help him apply for the college which he now attends. I saw that a relatively small contribution on my part could lead to a profound impact in another person‚Äôs life. Through this journey I learned that the individual must take action to create the change they desire to see in the lives of others and the world.",,,1,"The entire first year of my undergraduate education took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which greatly reduced my opportunity to gain further clinical experience.

Despite this challenge, I found a solution through telehealth medicine and worked diligently to gain clinical experience in more demanding semesters when these opportunities became available.

In each situation, I have reveled in the challenge of synthesizing different pieces of information to solve puzzles and find personalized solutions for the struggles of others.      

This core value stems back to my upbringing, as I watched my radiologist father analyze anatomical structures through CAT scans, MRIs, and other diagnostic imaging. It fascinated me that he could determine a diagnosis from blurs, creases, and blotches. As I learned from observing my father, being a doctor requires the utmost attention to even the most minor details. Routine diagnostic exams can often reveal significant pathology upon thorough review. For example, when a seemingly healthy middle-aged person came in for a pre-operation chest x-ray, my father discovered enlarged lymph nodes hiding behind the pulmonary hilum. Although this was completely unexpected, my father still picked up on an abnormality that altered the patient’s prognosis. It was as if he were solving a puzzle with no picture to guide him. In many ways, this is the story of my life, always seeking the picture on the puzzle box with 1000 pieces scattered before me. Watching my father throughout my childhood stoked my interest in medicine, as I saw the complexity of individual cases and the variety of factors that needed to be considered to diagnose patients accurately. I want to become a physician who constantly gains new knowledge and makes sense of each patient’s puzzle to improve their quality of life. 

In high school, I wanted to diversify my medical experiences, so I sought a reputable mission group that focused on healthcare instead of voluntourism. I joined MEDLIFE on a medical mission trip to Peru, which opened my eyes to the issues of access and equity. In Peru, I saw slums sprawling as far as the eye can see. The notion of brushing teeth, let alone using toothpaste, was nonexistent. At one particular clinic site, I set up a dental station where I taught children how to brush their teeth and gave out supplies. After demonstrating with a dental model, the children eagerly followed my lead and practiced, smiling ear to ear with their new knowledge and supplies. I noticed, however, that one child looked rather dejected. When I asked him what was wrong, he said that he was having trouble using the toothbrush and needed help. Without a second thought, I knelt down next to him and brushed his teeth for him while giving pointers in Spanish. By the time I was done, he was elated and gave me a big high five. Teaching him how to take care of himself felt rewarding and, more importantly, like it was my calling. I showed him how to help himself using nothing but information and empathy. I realized that as a physician, I could empower patients by teaching them healthy habits and practicing preventative medicine. Understanding the importance of continuity in helping patients achieve better outcomes, I revitalized our mission efforts in college through virtual learning opportunities that continue to fundraise for these same Peruvian populations during the pandemic.

While shadowing Dr. Levin, an anesthesiologist at a surgical outpatient center, I noticed one patient in the recovery area. The first thing that he requested was his trusted Miami Heat hat. Observing his body language and seeing that he was anxious and uncomfortable, I handed it to him, saying enthusiastically, “The Heat look good this year!” to which he replied with an instant ear-to-ear smile, “I know right! Jimmy Butler is a legend.” Before I could say another word, he exclaimed, “I think we can win the championship this year!” Dr. Levin walked in to check on the patient, who had a history of reacting to anesthesia with nausea and had been reluctant to use it again. With great confidence, Dr. Levin proudly patted him, declaring, “I told you that you would not have nausea this time.” Although this interaction is one of many that Dr. Levin undergoes on a consistent basis, I recognized Dr. Levin’s attentiveness to his patients, reassuring them that their trust was well placed. Seeing such connections inspired me to keep on the path of medicine so I can one day earn my patients’ trust.

More than any other career, a physician pieces together symptoms and demystifies something complex for patients, giving them more clarity and control over their lives. I envision my future self practicing preventative medicine in underserved communities. My experiences of service as a crisis counselor with the Trevor Project, mentoring students as a PAL, and founding and leading my very own nonprofit have ingrained the value of cultural humility and emotional intelligence into myself and I will carry that to my future practice.","One day in 2017, I walked in on a very close family member attempting to cut themself. I immediately intervened and attempted to console them. I was heartbroken and confused; this family member had always seemed so happy. With education, I was able to support my family member effectively. Witnessing the transformation that their support system helped make possible, I realized that I wanted to help those without access to similar supports._x000D_

Seeing that the pandemic cut off in-person support for LGBTQIA+ youth led me to sign up for the Trevor Project to become a crisis counselor.  With every conversation, I had the same feeling of wanting to help my family member. However, now I had effective tools to help people to the best of my ability. I aim to be a physician that patients feel comfortable with even if we are from different backgrounds. As such, I commit myself to clear and kind communication in addition to learning as much as I can to demonstrate my willingness to help and listen.","When I began college in Fall 2020, my desire to support others led me to EGIL (Educate, Growth, Inspire, Learn), where I act as a mentor and workshop coordinator. This nonprofit provides services for children of underserved communities: some are refugees, some are first-generation immigrants, some are orphans, and some are unhoused. Experiencing their resilience firsthand is mind-opening to the things that I take for granted. _x000D_

This has reinforced my passion for working with underserved communities. It is a powerful way to enhance cultural humility that will also benefit future patient interactions and create bonds with amazing people with unique backgrounds and stories. As such, as a medical student, I will commit myself to clear and kind communication in addition to learning as much as I can to demonstrate my willingness to help and listen. Additionally, I commit to fighting health inequities faced by BIPOC in Chicago‚Äôs west side neighborhoods.",,,1,"Due to COVID-19, my volunteer position at Boca Raton Regional Hospital was prematurely cut short; despite my best efforts, I also had difficulty finding physician shadowing opportunities after moving to the Greater Sacramento area.",1,0,3

Frozen in place, I digested news that my father was undergoing treatment for an ischemic stroke. Will my father have a permanent disability? How will my uninsured parents afford his care? What will happen to the family business? Four weeks away from graduating with a bachelor’s degree, I contemplated my future. My interests in biology and research initially steered me toward a career in biotechnology, but as my father regained function throughout the rehabilitation process my fascination with patient care and medicine grew. The empathy and technical skill displayed by his healthcare team inspired me to explore the medical field and define the role most congruent with my budding desire to treat and heal.

Clarity arrived during my first job in healthcare as a medical scribe, observing hospitalists manage cases ranging from acute kidney injury to gastrointestinal bleeds. One morning, Dr. Mahendra rounded on an elderly patient with end-stage congestive heart failure. I felt the tension in the room climb as she explained to the patient’s daughter that her unresponsive mother’s eerily regular cardiac rhythm was solely supported by the pacemaker firing in her chest. As Dr. Mahendra navigated this sensitive interaction with poise and compassion, I realized that this aspect of medicine – equipping patients and their loved ones with the resources and support to make dignified decisions in moments of vulnerability – was equally as important as formulating definitive treatment plans. This interaction, among others, fueled my desire to lead patient care as a physician.

While scribing provided me with a strong introduction to inpatient medicine, my position as a clinical research coordinator for oncology trials expanded my perspective of the patient-physician dynamic. I appreciated the additional responsibilities oncologists shoulder as Principal Investigators and the tenacity with which they strive to improve patient outcomes through novel treatments. Cancer patients who elect to participate in clinical trials have exhausted frontline treatments, and they place immense trust in their oncologists. 

One of my first research subjects, Mr. B, had metastatic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and lost the ability to speak after a prior laryngectomy. Two months into Mr. B’s trial enrollment, his visit attendance became erratic, raising concerns about the irregularity of treatments affecting the therapy’s effectiveness. I visited Mr. B during one of his infusions, broaching the topic of his attendance to better understand his situation. Mr. B’s brow furrowed as he etched on his whiteboard, “can’t afford parking and gas.” Although his treatment was covered by the trial sponsor, Mr. B’s lower socioeconomic status made transportation costs a financial constraint to participation. I worked with my PI and the sponsor to amend this study protocol to include travel and parking reimbursement for all research subjects. This encounter with Mr. B taught me how mindful communication and consideration for a patient’s circumstances promotes patient advocacy while improving treatment outcomes.

My experiences as an ophthalmic technician and scribe brought other aspects of medicine into focus. As the only Spanish-speaking employee at the clinic, it was gratifying to see the timid demeanors of Hispanic immigrant patients shift after greeting them in Spanish. One such patient, Mrs. G, arrived at the clinic complaining of a sudden loss of vision in her left eye. I learned that she had a history of poorly controlled diabetes and hadn’t visited her primary care doctor for two years, citing financial hardship and no health insurance. Clearly in distress, I eased her nerves by guiding her through our assessments and retinal imaging scans. Acting as her translator, I relayed directions while Dr. Taglia performed a dilated fundus exam to gauge the extent of her acute retinal detachment and diabetic retinopathy. After educating Mrs. G on the urgency of her condition and referring her to a nearby Retina Specialist, Dr. Taglia waived Mrs. G’s visit fee, which he often did for uninsured patients. Having lost an uncle to complications from poorly controlled diabetes, this interaction left me feeling hopeful for Mrs. G’s prognosis. Though I played an active role in Mrs. G’s care that afternoon, I longed to be in Dr. Taglia’s shoes. 

As an immature undergraduate lacking a clear vision for the future, I did not perform to the full extent of my academic ability. My experiences in the medical field motivated me to reflect on my past missteps and make the personal changes necessary to reach my academic potential. When I returned to college to improve my academic standing, I worked as a teaching assistant and supplemental instructor for two semesters. These experiences helped solidify my understanding of Anatomy and Physiology concepts, and I also found it gratifying to help other students master those subjects. I look forward to combining my interests in medicine, research and education as a medical student and future physician. It is my goal to expand the reach of translational medicine to vulnerable, marginalized populations and mentor the next generation of medical professionals.","In spring of 2021, I took on a weekend position as a vehicle transporter for a company called Vehi-ship in Glenwood, IL. This augmented my income while taking courses at IU Northwest. Most of the employees were Black and full of life and humor. They shared stories of the struggles of growing up in broken homes and dangerous neighborhoods, poverty, and lack of opportunity. Some had criminal records for which they served time behind bars, so Vehi-ship‚Äôs low entry requirements gave them an opportunity to support themselves and family. Many also had chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. This really put into perspective how fortunate I was to have grown up in a stable environment, with opportunities to advance in life because my basic needs were met by my parents and environment. It also opened me up to the charm of a diverse community; our different experiences better informed me of the disparities that afflict minority and underserved communities in my vicinity.","During the fall and spring semesters of 2021 and 2022, I worked as a supplemental instructor and teaching assistant for Anatomy and Physiology I & II at IU Northwest. Entering this role, I realized that my greatest challenge would be figuring out how to make my SI sessions interactive and engaging for students who had difficulty adjusting to in-person instruction or were unaccustomed to leveraging academic support systems in the past. After consulting the professor, I employed a flipped classroom along with group quizzes, Kahoot exercises, and chalkboard activities to promote interaction and reinforce concepts. This implementation taught me how to guide students‚Äô thought processes so that they may work themselves through any gaps in understanding. It was gratifying to watch students‚Äô performances improve as they became more proactive. This experience taught me how to approach, support, and encourage the academic goals of students from diverse backgrounds and learning style preferences.",,,1,"I worked in oncology clinical research at Rush University Cancer Center during the height of the pandemic, and I saw how the novel coronavirus strained the resources and human capital of a large academic medical center.

After leaving Rush to pursue post-bacc courses I worked as an ophthalmic technician/scribe at LTF Eye Clinics. There, I worked with patients whose socioeconomic status hindered their ability to afford treatment, whose immigrant status presented an additional barrier to accessing care, and whose disability status posed logistical challenges to preventative care.

Being immigrants from India, a language barrier would sometimes prevent them from understanding educational materials given by the doctor, or how to use the glucometer. When my parents needed to check their blood sugars, I used to pretend I was the doctor, and they were my patients. I pricked their fingers, tested the blood, and then reported the results. Over time, I started understanding how their blood sugars changed based on exercise, their eating habits, and their medication schedule.

However, there was a connection that I didn’t see as a child. Being immigrants added another strain to my parents' healthcare experience: lack of quality health insurance. Doctor’s appointments were expensive, meaning that their diagnoses came too late. Seeing the burden chronic disease placed on my parents spurned a passion for helping the underserved communities around me gain better access to healthcare.

I have had the opportunity to create change in underserved communities on a personal level by volunteering as an EMT at the Urban Ministries Open Door Clinic and at the Mariam Clinic. Both clinics help serve uninsured patients with no other access to healthcare, including many immigrant communities. I am able to help people, who, much like my own parents, are navigating a new country and a new healthcare system. I meet with many patients who have chronic diseases, and can see the impact that healthcare, along with education and treatment, have on various diseases. I have seen a patient go from having a prediabetic A1C to a normal A1C over the course of several months. I have also seen a patient, with no knowledge of even having diabetes, finally receive treatment and be able to see their blood sugar levels decrease. The routine of seeing patients was one that also became like second nature to me, and seeing the results from treatments made me feel like I was truly making a change. Walking down the hallways on my shifts, I would sometimes see patients I had helped in the past, and we’d stop to chat, and I’d give a high-five to their kids in passing. I saw how I had become a part of my patients' lives, as someone they trusted. I began to see the role a physician takes on in a person’s life, and strive to be that person, in the same way that physicians were to my parents.

However, I failed to recognize one thing: what could be done when lifestyle changes, education, and medication weren’t enough? During one of my shifts at the Mariam Clinic, a patient of mine had come in to see the psychiatrist, something she told me while I took her vitals. When the psychiatrist came in, she explained that the death of her mother and being cut off from loved ones due to the pandemic had triggered feelings of hopelessness and isolation. In the past, I had always spoken to patients casually about their lives, but I never had a patient bare such a serious side to themselves. After we listened to her, I watched as the healthcare provider discussed treatment options with her. However, there were no educational materials she could take home about lifestyle or diet changes, and no tests or monitors she could use to measure her condition. There was no feeling of satisfaction that went home with me either, while I was driving back and processing the interaction in my mind. Nothing could be cured overnight, but the important part was that her treatment had begun, and the access to healthcare that the clinic had given her could begin its process. After all, this is why I wanted to become a physician - to give people such as her the ability to have a fighting chance.

One month passed, and it was time for her follow up. I finished taking her vitals, and could see that physically, there was nothing wrong with her. When the psychiatrist came in, she spoke to us about how she continued to miss her mother, and that the effects were interfering with day-to-day tasks. Medication had only helped to an extent, but there was not much else that could be done for her. We spent the rest of the meeting encouraging her and reminding her of the support she had here in the clinic, as well as in her family.

Several months into her treatment, my patient continued to feel down and depressed, and the medication seemed to prove mostly ineffective. However, she told us she still wanted to try to get better. The encouragement and hope we imparted on her at every meeting had given her the strength to want to continue treatment. The space we had given her to talk about her problems had made her feel as though she was not alone. I was uplifted that I had had such an impact on her. Before, I used to spend time after our meetings questioning whether I had let her down as one of her healthcare providers, when I didn’t stop to think about what I had already done for her. As a physician, there will be days that will not always hold successes. However, a physician must never forget about the things that are within their power. Together, my patient and I will take it one day at a time, as I plan to do with all my future patients.","Growing up with a twin sister, I routinely grew tired of the constant comparisons, and people assuming that appearing similar on the outside meant we were similar on the inside. As a result, I began to develop a desire for people to see me as an individual, and not simply under the label of ‚Äútwin‚Äù. As I got older, I began to see more and more how labels began to shape our world, and even our healthcare system. While volunteering with patients at the Urban Ministries Clinic and the Mariam Clinic, I realized the various labels and connotations placed on patients unknowingly. For example, non-English speaking patients were seen as more ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù, and male patients tended to downplay their pain to seem more masculine. However, my own desire to be seen beyond a label had come to influence my clinical experiences, and I found myself getting to know each of my patients beyond a set of numbers and a diagnosis, and have realized what it means to view a patient holistically.","Currently, many health insurance companies use guidelines which entail that an individual must be a current smoker, or have quit smoking within the past 15 years, to decide whether to cover the cost of lung cancer screenings. However, environmental pollutants can also play a role in the development of lung cancer. As victims of environmental racism, many people of color in NC live in areas with poorer air quality. Due to this, they are disproportionately subjected to having a higher risk of developing lung cancer, but can be ineligible for lung cancer screenings, or to have these procedures covered by their health insurance. As a member of the American Lung Cancer Screening Initiative, with other members, I was able to speak to the offices of two U.S. Congressmen about the passage of H.R. 3749 through the U.S. House of Representatives, a bill that will certify that smoking history is not the only basis for screening, and ensure that health insurance companies cover these screenings.",,,1,"With the pandemic throwing a wrench into my ability to expand my experiences in the healthcare field, I knew I lacked clarity. The all-important question of ‚Äúwhy do you wish to be a physician?‚Äù could only be answered half-heartedly by me. A research internship that I had originally been accepted to for the summer of 2020 at the Wake Forest School of Medicine had been postponed to the following year. Calling medical offices for the opportunity to shadow doctors at the facility had understandably resulted in many rejections. However, when quarantine and pandemic restrictions began to ease, my ability to gain critical healthcare-related experiences eased along with it. My research internship at Wake Forest resumed for the summer of 2021, and I also found two new opportunities to volunteer with patients at free clinics. Upon graduation, my work still continues in all these areas, and of course, the all-important question of ‚Äúwhy do you wish to be a physician?‚Äù finally has an answer.",1,0,2

As Jax and I prepared for our first stunt of the season, my face stretched into a grinning mask to cover my fear. I trust Jax to get me on his shoulders. He trusts me to keep steady until the kickoff signal.

My fear was from the transition from gymnastics -  a solitary sport - to cheerleading, a cohesive team sport. When I started cheerleading, I only trusted myself: my skills and strength. But, to win in cheerleading, I have to trust my base. Practice and communication together create a rhythm, and no one has the exact same rhythm. My base is my buffer between air and ground. With practice also comes mistakes: my foot slipped, and now the ground accelerated to my face. But Jax stopped the collision in time. Together, Jax and I work with others and build a stunt pyramid. Finally, our team works as a unit and builds the trust for success. 

Out on the field, part of the team faces the crowd and waits for the signal to thrust our signs in the air and shout “GO!” At the other end of the field, the rest of the team does the same with “BLUE!” The crowd follows our direction and chants “GO BLUE!” We then run off the field to allow the players the space they need to restart the play.

Last summer, I took part in a new team and led patients to recovery instead of crowds in cheer. I was a patient attendant at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Once, in the Cardiovascular Care Unit, I sat with an elderly man after his heart surgery. His healthcare team worked together like it was a rehearsed routine. I cleared chairs. Nurses cleared wires. The surgeon readied to shock the patient's heart out of atrial fibrillation. “This isn’t exactly what it looks like in the movies,” the surgeon said to me, “it’s scarier in real life.” He readied the AED paddles, and as he began to say ‘clear,’ the patient’s heart returned to a regular rhythm. “He must’ve heard us and jumped started his own heart. That happens sometimes,” the surgeon commented. To him this may have been a small observation, this moment confirmed that the hospital was my home.

I always knew I wanted to be a doctor. Every time Mom came home from work she burst through the door, her white coat in the breeze behind her, I ran to smell her. It's bizarre, but the antibacterial soaps used at hospitals were pleasant to me. It was a doctor’s smell, a smell I wanted and trusted. I was unsure how important the smell was until I entered the environment of the hospital. Especially in the elderly man’s ICU room. The energy resembled football sidelines and the pressure of the game with my team.

I often asked Mom questions about her work: when my sister had knee pain, I probed her about the diagnosis. “Patellofemoral pain syndrome,” Mom says. When asked what those words mean, she returned:

“Where is the patella?”
“In the knee,” I say.  
“What does ‘-femor-’ sound like?”
“Femur.”

This was her way of dissection, active recall, and listening skill practice. In her elusive way, she was trying to get me to put it together on my own. “It’s the name for the pain in her knee cap?”

“Yes!”

Our discussions were critical for my education, conversations, and experiences. This includes how people speak to me as a Black woman and my interpretation of novels or articles. In 2020, I learned that Black women die from poor maternity care the way Black men die from police encounters. The CDC found Black women's childbirth mortality rates were higher than white and Hispanic women's at 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. Black women are 2.9 times more likely to face death at childbirth. Physicians at times diminish Black people’s pain because “we can handle it,” and diminish women’s pain because “we’re dramatic.” Combined, this leads to significant disparities in Black women's mortality rate during childbirth. 

How can the Black community trust healthcare institutions? What role can I play to change that statistic? Initially, orthopedics interested me because of gymnastics and cheer. I often saw musculoskeletal injuries and wanted to add myself to the list of 100 Black female orthopedic surgeons.  Plus, studies show Black patient health outcomes improve with Black physicians. These Black patient care statistics inspired other possible specialties and increased my commitment. I will be on the winning team for the Black community and restore positive healthcare interactions with people who look like me.

When I was a Peer Facilitator for a Research Health Sciences seminar, I shared this statistical information to my students. My students were 1st and 2nd-year undergrads of variable race and gender. I wanted my students to understand other identity perspectives. So I taught about the role of race in research ethics, imposter syndrome, and inclusivity. They seemed as startled as I was. My goal as a teacher was to expose students to how identities affect health care disparities.

I believe patients' trust in physicians and the healthcare institution is central to medical care success. Success requires teamwork and trust. These days I still trust Jax to hold my legs on his shoulders. There, I look across the Big House stadium into my future in medicine leading patients to recovery.","My study abroad experience was integral to my cultural experiences. After growing up near the Austin area, I drove down Division to get to Lake Michigan. I would drive through Humbolt Park and look at the language changes. I‚Äôm glad I understood most of the content on buildings. I grew up with Spanish and knew that I wanted that skill for the rest of my life. I even want to practice medicine in Spanish. Studying abroad is perfect to plunge into Spanish culture. _x000D_

In Spain, I took courses with European graduate students and other American students. The curriculum focused on collaboration with other students in the class. I presented research proposals to everyone. I also lived with University of Salamanca students. I loved the lingo and fashion of the European students. I experienced different Spanish habits: smoking, mealtimes, and walking. These habits are both positive and negative health effects. If countries integrate habits and education, certain nations could improve their health.","In Spain, I explained why someone who used he/him pronouns referred to themselves as ‚Äúone of the girlies"".

Life became difficult, and for the first time as a Black woman, I had racial slurs hurled at me. I was anxious, lost a lot of social responsibilities, and isolated myself.

A few weeks later, I received a second opinion. Dr. Weiss Kelly, a sports medicine specialist who works with the Cleveland Browns, sat down with me, leaned in, and asked me what my goals were. I expressed to her that I wanted to play in Notre Dame stadium. Without hesitation, she locked eyes with me and said, “We will make that happen.” Two years later, I made the opening tackle against the 5th ranked Fighting Irish in their home stadium in South Bend.

If you were to ask me six years ago if my childhood dream of playing Division I Football would be realized I would have answered with a resounding no. However, having a doctor champion for my present and future self, galvanized my spirit and allowed my childhood dream to crystalize. Ultimately, Dr. Weiss Kelly’s care and affirmation of my dreams displayed to me that the magnitude of the impact of a physician extends beyond the walls of the clinic or hospital. 

Committing to the welfare of others ignites my passion for service. During my work mentoring with The Afterschool Program (TAP), I developed numerous significant relationships with my mentees while helping them envision a different future. “Will” was one of my first mentees and at 13 years old his passion for basketball was unwavering. Whenever he walked, he would dribble an imaginary ball practicing his crossover and behind-the-back moves. As I spent more time with him, he informed me of his family dynamic. The eldest child in his family, he was responsible for taking care of both his diabetic grandmother and little sister while his mom worked. Consequently, this hindered him from trying out for the middle school basketball team. Thinking about how I could empower Will through this time in his life, I organized a surprise guest appearance for him and the other kids. The disbelief on Will’s face as he hung from the rim after being hoisted up by the 6 '10'’ Vanderbilt starting Center is still vividly ingrained in my mind. 

Despite the positive emotions that I associate with surprising Will, it is challenging for me to ignore the underlying issues of health inequity he and his family encounter. Hearing about the strain Will and his family were under made me hypervigilant about understanding the impact of the social determinants of health. This has since prompted my academic and career endeavors in this arena.  

When I transitioned to the post-baccalaureate program at Washington University in St. Louis, I grew as both a student and an individual. Not only have I been able to take accountability for my prior academic performance, but I have also been able to delve deeply into my passion for healthcare delivery and advocacy. Volunteering with IFM community medicine has directly exposed me to some of the issues that interfere with effective medical care.

One day in the clinic, a man timidly walked back to the exam room. His breathing was unsteady, and he was shaking uncontrollably. His distress reminded me of how I felt when I was sitting alone on the medical exam table in Dr. Weiss Kelly’s office. Slowly getting up, I asked if I could sit next to him. As I comforted him, he confided in me. He explained to me that the doctor’s office always triggered distress for him, and he avoided seeking medical help unless it was necessary due to his prior experiences with the healthcare system. Leaving the clinic that day, I became resolute in my mission to pursue medicine to induce positive medical change for all.

My understanding of how positive medical change could be achieved was furthered by my time shadowing Dr. Coney, a retina specialist for the Cleveland Clinic. Towards the end of his clinic, Dr. Coney received a call from a patient who was running late. Instead of turning the patient away, he told them that he would stay around until they arrived. Walking into the clinic, the patient exclaimed, “I always know you will be there for me, and I greatly appreciate that.” The gratitude of this patient alongside my experience in the IFM clinic has informed my belief about garnering positive medical change for all. I believe that to do so generational trust must be established through the continuity of care.

Reliving my experiences with Dr. Weiss Kelly, Will, and Dr. Coney while also considering my time currently as a volunteer with IFM community medicine, I now understand that access to good healthcare lays a foundation for a legacy of good health. This legacy of good health can then promote agency and choice to do something or to be something better. Being able to pave this foundation for others through establishing communities of trust within the hospital walls and outside of them has been a motivating priority of my service, advocacy, and ultimate reasoning for looking towards the horizons of the noble profession of medicine.","As an African-American (AA) male growing up in a suburban community with few minorities, I often found myself in places and spaces that my external appearance and speech created unanticipated challenges. This led me to become adept at ‚Äúcode- switching‚Äù ‚Äì alternating my behavior and speech to that of the crowd I was with so that I could blend in. I would endeavor to be ‚Äúcool‚Äù with my AA friends and later strive to be accepted as ‚Äúone of them‚Äù with my Caucasian friends. All the while losing a sense of identity but most importantly losing a sense of belonging. In high school, I began to embrace my authentic self and develop my identity.This not only allowed me to accept my uniqueness in background, but to embrace the uniqueness of others. My identity transitioned from a source of isolation to a secure platform of strength and belonging in diverse settings. It is from this secure platform of strength that I seek to serve and embrace my future patients and colleagues at Rush Medical College","I often find myself reminiscing fondly upon the time I spent volunteering at The Afterschool Program (TAP) in Nashville.  Over my three years as a volunteer, I mentored many kids each with their own unique talents and gifts. ‚ÄúDavid,‚Äù a 5th grader when I initially began volunteering, was barely reading at the 2nd grade level. As his mentor, I began encouraging him to read his favorite books with me. With each ensuing month, progress in David‚Äôs reading ability was perceptible and his confidence grew. Instead of relying on me to reassure him that he was pronouncing challenging words correctly, he would diligently sound out the word until he had the correct pronunciation. At the end of my time volunteering with TAP, David was a 7th grader reading at a 9th grade level. His maturation into an avid reader is something that I was honored to facilitate. It demonstrated to me the empowering role of positive mentorship and guidance.",,,1,,1,0,2
2023,15703003,,29,Woman,USA,0,,0,1,"While privileged in many ways, my social and financial background has placed me at a disadvantage as a medical school applicant. From age 13, I was raised in a single parent household, limiting our financial resources. When my mother was then diagnosed with cancer, I had to take on a caregiver role for my mother and sister at a young age. I have been working since I was 16, often full time in addition to classes, to help support myself and my education. I have needed to prioritize my income over academics or potential clinical opportunities, allowing me to empathize with how one’s capacity can be diluted by context. Putting myself through my Master’s program and now pursuing medical school has been a journey driven by passion but with limited guidance. Coming from a family of artists, I do not have inherent connections or financial support that could make this a seamless process. I have therefore worked extremely hard to earn everything that I have achieved and highly value each of my successes.
My type 1 diabetes has also been a significant hurdle. While I refuse to let it limit me, it has taken significant time, energy, and money away from my chosen pursuits. Understanding the additional, global demands of a chronic illness is a unique perspective that I would like to bring into the field of medicine.",U,0,0,,0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,18118,6201.0,705.0,158.0,6460.0,,1,863,1,7165,08/27/2022,Georgetown University,Biology of Global Health,0,,Yes,Yes,No,Do not know,4,1,1,1,6.0,21.0,23.0,0.0,45.0,5.0,0.0,19,Significant,3,2023,2,4.0,0.5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,"There are countless ways to approach a puzzle. Of course, there are some tried-and-true methods, like sorting by color or using the box as a guide, but, after the edges are assembled and several hundred pieces remain, approaches can vary. This is when I am sucked in by the intricacies of a jigsaw, excited to find the best mix of strategies to employ. The more complex, the more I am drawn in. I see practicing medicine as a beautiful blend of puzzles and humanity. In a sense, the medical practitioner and the puzzler are one in the same, both benefit from discovering different perspectives and adapting their strategies to their contexts.

Assured by my personal, professional, and academic experiences, I believe that my strengths in a multi-perspective, problem-solving approach make medicine a context that I can thrive in. In my nontraditional progression towards medicine, I have embraced the compassionate side of healthcare while building a realistic view of the system itself. I have also developed the skills and experiences needed to broaden the viewpoints at my disposal while piecing together where I will fit in this field.

My interest in medicine began in high school when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Her doctors made a traumatic moment for our family feel surmountable. Their individualized and sensitive care humanized the field of medicine for me. I later found myself leaning into a similar caregiver role, changing my mom’s dressings and monitoring her symptoms. From this, I crafted a vision of a future working within the borders of science, strategy, and helping others.

Later, I unfortunately had the opposite experience while pursuing treatment for my own chronic health condition. I was given standardized treatment plans without discussion. There were moments when I considered not seeking further care as it felt like my voice had been stifled and there were pieces swept under the rug. Feeling reduced to just my diagnosis made the cost of underrepresentation of differently-abled people in medicine clear. As a result, I learned the importance of a patient-centered approach and strong communication skills for practitioners. This experience and the confidence in relating to my patients that I’ve gained thereafter has highlighted an unmet need in the medical field that I feel empowered to fill.

My medical aspirations became deeper rooted within my clinical research position on the MGH pediatric epilepsy team. Putting the pieces together to help a child progress from hundreds of seizures per week to seizure freedom has been one of the most rewarding experiences. I will always remember the joy and pride in my sweetest patient’s face when she first pointed at the blood pressure cuff, excitedly repeating “Hug!”. Something like learning the function of a tool or remembering what I had taught her months prior would have been impossible for her before the trial. Moments like this and the close connections developed with my patients and their families fuel my passion for medicine.

Taking an active role on a care team has also illuminated the many administrative, logistical, and industry demands associated with providing care. Diligently, I have worked through the nuances of treatment options, adherence, and obstacles that go into navigating someone’s health puzzle. Doing so within the regulations of a clinical trial has taught me how to balance competing demands and how to prioritize a holistic approach. Throughout my experiences, I have been able to ground myself in the personal and operational competencies needed to excel as a physician.

Through my Master of Public Health, I have also explored the broader community and institutional contexts of health that impact patients and their care. During a major public health crisis, I was able to learn first-hand how disparities develop and carry throughout our healthcare system, particularly in the context of reproductive and child health. My MPH underscored the importance of making space for a diverse scope of identities and of consciously evaluating my own privileges and their interplay. With a more evolved perspective on what public health truly is, I am now able to apply a greater range of lenses in order to provide culturally-competent and respectful care.

I have been told that I have an almost savant-like knack for puzzling. Personally, I think it has less to do with good visual-spatial skills and more to do with my tenacity and aptitude for problem solving. Each time that I place a piece, I take away new strategies for the next. I now carry the approach of both the puzzler and the practitioner forward, consciously gathering as many perspectives as possible into my dynamic, puzzle-solving toolkit. Although I am prepared for whatever the future holds, there are few absolute certainties in life. Mine include that I have my mom’s unconditional support, that I will someday adopt a Corgi named Waffles, and that I can thrive as a physician. This confidence in my future comes from my nontraditional path, through which I have substantiated my interest in medicine with concrete skills and experiences. Now sure that I have the disposition, drive, and ability to become an excellent physician, I am poised to evolve from puzzle-master to physician.","When starting my clinical research role, I never expected to learn so much about communication from my nonverbal patients. Until working with them, I had no idea how much I relied on words. When I saw how deeply intune my nonverbal patients and their families were, I thought about how much could be conveyed nonverbally. I decided that I was going to shift my focus from what I was saying to how I was saying it and how the patient was responding. I grew more sensitive to tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language, both for myself and others, and became better able to pick up subtle shifts and their messages. While I continue to speak to all of my patients directly, regardless of whether they can understand me or speak, I know that we can still have ‚Äòconversations‚Äô and build connections in our own nonverbal ways. Having strong nonverbal communication skills will be an asset as a physician, allowing me to create connections and trust with patients who cannot understand my words.","In 2017, I began mentoring teens with epilepsy through a weekly dog training program. I was told that Maddie* was enthusiastic but was there for socialization as she wasn‚Äôt developmentally capable of training a dog. Her dog, Poochie, came with a similar disclaimer. Nonetheless, Maddie, Poochie, and I instantly bonded as a team._x000D_
_x000D_
At times, Maddie became upset when Poochie wouldn‚Äôt listen but I helped her learn to refocus her emotions and energy. We celebrated the little victories along the way. Maddie was persistent with training and grew in confidence. With my support, Maddie did the end of year dog show on her own, proudly taking Poochie through all of the same tricks as the group. I know that with persistence and a little support, people can rise to a challenge. As a member of the chronic illness community, it meant a lot to me to be that support for Maddie. As a physician, I won‚Äôt underestimate my patients and will instead give them the same support that I gave Maddie. ",,,1,"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, my clinical research responsibilities increased substantially and I was considered an in person, essential worker. Overall, I appreciated the additional trust and responsibility given to me to act so independently as well as the opportunity to learn about telemedicine. However, these COVID-19 modifications did add significant strain to my role and took time and energy away from previously intended publication projects, volunteer efforts, and shadowing experiences. _x000D_

COVID-19 restrictions also delayed the completion of my Master of Public Health program from May to September 2021. As I was still working full time, this in turn delayed when I could begin my MCAT prep and medical school applications.

I tried my best to hide my excitement, fearing that it may show how insecure and self-conscious I had been for so many years. In typical preadolescent fashion, I was determined to never let anyone know how embarrassed I was about my exceptionally short stature. Retrospectively, I feel I did a pretty good job of this. I rarely showed negative emotions when others poked fun at me and I did my best to crack a smile or fake a laugh, but it hurt. By the time I was twelve, I was officially shorter than ninety-nine percent of the population for my age and sex. At this point, I was aware of the impact this would have on my future. I knew I would have to work harder than anyone else to succeed in baseball and I knew I would likely face lifelong ridicule about my height. When I finally received my first supply of somatropin, a human growth hormone treatment given to children who fail to grow, I was ecstatic. For the next five years of my life, I injected myself every single night with somatropin, often hiding in the bathroom so my friends would not see during sleep-overs and baseball trips; I did not want anyone to know my secret. For these reasons, I am incredibly thankful for my modest five-foot-seven-inch height, but far more importantly, I am thankful for the lessons my experience taught me on the importance of both medicine and consideration for others. 

While this experience represents a relatively short-lived time period of my life, I owe my initial desire to pursue medicine to it. It was this experience that showed me firsthand how impactful medicine can be both physically and mentally, and I knew it was something I had to share with others. Since that point, my dream of one day becoming a physician has remained as my guiding star - leading me to colleagues, environments, and experiences I would never have expected, and that I will never forget.

My time working as a phlebotomist was enlightening to me for a variety of reasons. For one, I was working in a Level 1 Trauma Center during the deadliest pandemic in American history. Secondly, I was working hands-on with patients for the first time in my life. Thirdly, I was performing a procedure on these patients that sometimes causes pain, and for some, intense anxiety. At this point in my life, I did not have much experience in situations where I was providing support to people whom I did not know, and who may be several decades older than me. Because of this, each and every day was a learning experience in patient care, compassion, and empathy. As the months went by, I met and drew blood from individuals of all ages and all situations; from children as young as 12 years old to near-centenarians, as well as from newly postpartum mothers to patients with life-threatening diseases and terminal illnesses. Through meeting these several hundred individuals, I began to understand what it really means to be a healthcare provider. One experience that stood out to me as a phlebotomist was meeting a particular woman and her daughter. The first time I drew this patient's blood, it became apparent to me that she was not a fan of needles. She pleaded with me to use the smallest needle and to make it as fast as possible, to which I obliged. As I was cleaning up my supplies and preparing her samples to be sent to the lab, I had a short conversation with this woman and her daughter; they mentioned that they were originally from Kansas City. We discussed how we were all from Kansas City for several minutes before I said my goodbyes and wished them a good rest of their day. Several days passed before I was once again sent to draw this woman’s blood. I approached her room, prepared my supplies with the smallest needle possible, and began to walk into her room when a physician swiftly entered the room just before me. I quietly pushed my phlebotomy cart into the room to wait in the corner while the physician chatted with the patient and her daughter. The physician calmly and quickly explained to the woman that she had been diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer and that they were currently deciding on a treatment plan. After a brief few minutes of conversation, he briskly exited the room. As tears began to fill the eyes in the room, I thought about my family, my friends, and my loved ones. How would I want them to be treated in this situation? I gently approached these two women, extended my support and empathy, and joined them in prayer. Knowing the gravity of the situation, my sincere hope was that I could provide these women with some amount of encouragement and compassion before leaving the room. 

Since that day, my desire to help patients continues to grow. Through working as an EMT, volunteering as a crisis counselor, advising freshman students, and working with special needs individuals, I have been fortunate to learn from the experiences shared with a wide variety of societal groups. These experiences have all led me to this point; applying to medical school and pursuing my greatest dream. I am incredibly eager to embark on the rigorous and fulfilling journey ahead!","Serving as a volunteer crisis counselor to many LGBTQ+ individuals through the Crisis Text Line was one experience I had that allowed me to work with individuals unlike myself. Because this work involves such intimate conversation with these individuals, it presented an excellent opportunity for me to truly understand them and learn more about their experiences and culture. This has been a tremendous learning experience for me, allowing me to become more professional, more culturally aware and sensitive, and more understanding in general. As a medical professional, it will be imperative that I take into consideration the culture, background, and lifestyle of each patient in addition to their thoughts and feelings. We know that many minority populations in the United States have significantly worse health outcomes than majority population groups, and it is my hope that my work with diverse populations throughout my life will allow me to avoid these health disparities in my practice.","As a volunteer for the Central Missouri Foster Care & Adoption Association, my work involved examining foster care and adoption policies and programs around the nation to understand the causes behind disparities we see between foster children and non-foster children. As I delved deeper into these issues, it appeared to me that these disparities were not due to a difference in the innate characteristics of individuals but were rather due to a systemic failure to provide the necessary resources and support to help foster children succeed. In other words, the system in place is not addressing the core issues such as childhood trauma, and the effects of this lack of action are leading to massive disparities in outcomes for foster children versus non-foster children. Using this information, I researched programs used by other organizations around the nation which aim to combat this issue and drafted a 12-page program for the CMFCAA that I believe may help to address these problems.",,,1,"The primary impact COVID-19 had on my academic life was the movement to online courses for three of my first four semesters of college. While this was an unfortunate way to spend half of my undergraduate years, the main impact this had on my journey to medicine was impairing my ability to volunteer and conduct research. As I was actively seeking out opportunities in these two areas, I was told many times that volunteer opportunities and labs were either no longer in operation, or were in the process of downsizing due to COVID-19 restrictions. For these reasons, I chose to instead pursue healthcare employment opportunities, which were ubiquitous, as well as virtual volunteer opportunities such as Crisis Text Line counseling. While I do believe it would have been advantageous to have conducted research during college, I believe the multitude of healthcare experiences I substituted have prepared me well for life in medical school, and I am hopeful to engage in research during this time.",1,1,1

Since I was 7, I first-handedly have experienced how Alzheimer's Disease and Lou Gehrig's Disease have affected my grandmother and uncle, and the effect it had on my parents, who acted as their primary caretakers. My personal experiences with these diseases have inspired me to seek a career in medicine, with the goal of pursuing a career in neurology, and being able to assist patients in the same way that physicians have taken care of my family members. From volunteering at University Hospitals in high-school to now volunteering at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH), this passion has been sustained through patient interactions, along with those with my family. Even as I lack the training to alleviate their symptoms or cure them of their disease, these patient interactions have allowed me to connect with their backstories, understand their hopes in receiving care, and ease the burden of receiving care on them and their families as they face the same diseases that affect my family alike. 

My role as a clinical volunteer at NMH has exposed me to many patients with cognitive diseases and highlighted the socioeconomic discrepancies in receiving medical care. One interaction involved a 74-year old patient with dementia who was in need of assistance to get to a supposed appointment with Social Services. It turned out that the patient had mixed this up with an appointment with their neuropsychologist, who indicated upon arrival that this was a common instance due to their disease. This confusion led the patient and I on a hour-long expedition, during which they voiced how difficult it was for them to stay on top of and travel to their hour-away appointments without someone to guide and support them. This discussion helped open my eyes to the socioeconomic discrepancies that patients face in receiving treatment, and how especially important strong social networks are for maximizing neurological healthcare outcomes, as these patients are all the more vulnerable. This patient had been on their own to schedule, remember, and travel to their appointments, with Medicare coverage limiting which doctors they could even see – which is why they had to travel so far. Simply due to their insurance coverage and lack of a strong social support, their normally routine appointment became significantly harder to attend, and their disease harder to manage. With my own family, my grandmother's remembrance of and transportation to her appointments had never been daunting, because she always had my parents and myself to remind and support her through them. Even with insurance issues limiting her treatment options, our familial support and willingness to travel with her proved enough to help her face the inconceivable battle of a disease with no cure. Ultimately, enriching experiences like this one have sustained my desire to become a physician, and to work alongside social workers to assure patients have all the social support possible in receiving treatment. And as a medical student and physician, I hope to provide free assessments and care to enhance treatment availability, so patients like the one above do not have to go to extreme measures for routine appointments. 

While my clinical experiences have strengthened my desire to practice in a clinical setting, my research and teaching experiences drive me to conduct research and teach as a physician. With my research experiences, I have been able to expand upon my interest in combating neurodegenerative diseases in an exploratory setting. Clinical experiences have awarded me meaningful interactions with patients, but by working in labs I have directly applied my knowledge to combat the biological basis for these diseases, and participated in discoveries that may soon be applied in the clinic. Working in the Vassar Lab has additionally allowed me to work and research alongside physicians, like Dr. Cahan who I shadowed, and see how the research they conduct is directly inspired by and applied to the patients they see everyday. These experiences have highlighted that as a future physician, I will be trained to treat patients with known successful methods, but hopefully contribute to discovering groundbreaking techniques in order to treat patients far into the future. But this can only be done with an appreciation for and drive to learn that must extend beyond my medical school years. With my extensive experiences as a teaching assistant and tutor, I hope to continue on my pursuit of acting as an educator, but just as importantly learn from the experiences of other physicians, especially as I seek the best ways to treat my future patients. This is something I plan to continue into medical school as my classmates and I embark on the journey that we have envisioned for years – to be great physicians, and to service those who need it most. And with the continuation of these practices from my undergrad into my medical career, I hope to be a physician that assists my patients’ and their families through hardships and one that will be remembered the same way I remember those that have helped my own family.","Working in the Indian American Medical Association‚Äôs Free Clinic granted me knowledge of how immigrants often lack healthcare insurance, and how that limits treatment and medication options. With this, chronic illnesses such as diabetes are overrepresented amongst this community, and contribute to the onset of other symptoms. My knowledge from working with underserved populations inspired me to advocate for them amongst my undergraduate peers, and to push them to volunteer in the clinic to keep it afloat. This advocacy has involved informing my peers of the disparities amongst the Indian immigrant population in order to push the importance of volunteering at the clinic. This involvement is something I hope to continue at Rush as a medical student and as a future physician. Specifically, I desire to volunteer at the RCSIP Clinic at the Chicago City Church, and to actually play a role in treating patients who cannot afford it otherwise, rather than just learn about their struggles.","My experiences at predominantly white universities allowed me to understand how the integration into college campuses is more difficult for students of color, as many lack the mentorship necessary to navigate their universities. With the receiving of mentorship from other Black students, I have been inspired to continue this with incoming ones through Black student groups, and to similarly make their integration into university easier. From helping formulate MCAT schedules to helping first-years pick their classes, I reciprocated the help I received. With this, I hope to foster their academic success necessary to stimulate more racial representation in their field of choice. Through this recognition of the importance of mentorship, at Rush I hope to work with the Interprofessional Medical Student Association, where I believe I can help increase diversity in medicine by working to create a mentoring system for Rush‚Äôs incoming Black medical students.",,,1,"The pandemic cut my patient-care experiences short, yet allowed me to act as a primary caretaker for my grandmother with Alzheimer‚Äôs.

As non-patient care experiences began to open, I focused my time on research, which allowed me to realize my enthusiasm for neurodegenerative scientific discovery. Additionally, I invested my time in acting as a peer guided study group and an in-class facilitator for organic chemistry.

From a young age, empathy has been fostered in my upbringing and engraved in my heart and mind. Growing up, my parents shaped my outlook on life and instilled the concept of placing myself in another’s shoes. As a young girl, my dad was my greatest model, and I was tied to his every move. This included fifteen year old me going to work with my dad. I woke up at 6:00 am and was ready by 6:15. Rushing my very punctual father to make it to the car in time, we drove to meet my dad’s client, Justin. Leading into my first day at work, I was filled with a constant sensation of complete and utter excitement. This excitement latched onto me the whole drive to Justin’s home. As I rang the doorbell, I heard what sounded like heavy thumping down the stairs. Justin was running towards me with open arms, beautiful almond shaped eyes, and a gleaming smile. In an effort to match his excitement, I attempted to wrap my arms around him, hugging him just as tightly. The day at work with my father seemed almost as if it were a play date due to how pleasurable every part of it was. Justin braided my hair, I braided his. The world had deemed Justin disabled, but to me, he proved to be capable and full of potential. 

When the “play date” came to an end, my dad finally convinced me it was time to leave Justin and return home. On the drive home, I told my dad that his job was “easy” and that one day I would come to work here. Only the latter half of that statement was true. To expand and apply this service in my life, I started working with people like Justin. Serving people with disabilities placed me in one of the richest classrooms a human can experience. 

Little did I know how emotionally tolling this job would be. My first client was Summer. Coming from an abusive household, Summer spent most of her life homeless. Upon one of my first meetings with Summer, we discussed her goals and aspirations including her desire to get a job and change her name to escape her past. After hearing her story and speaking with her, I took her on as my first client, with mixed emotions of both excitement but also a feeling of insufficiency. I feared that nothing within my capabilities would be sufficient to help Summer as much as my heart desired. Upon leaving Summer, I went to my car, shut the door, and felt a rush of tears overwhelm me. I was crying. I thought about having my first client ever since meeting Justin and I had waited for this exact moment, a moment that brought me to unstoppable tears. It was a combination of the sight of the living conditions of someone so pure like Summer and the thought of the disparity between how much I wanted to help her and others, but what little I could actually do. I was afraid. Summer’s one request was to heal from a heavy past, and I questioned my ability to provide a solution. 

I quickly realized that empathy alone was not enough. I learned that persistence, humility, and competence must be added to empathy to adequately care for another person. I believe that medical school is the missing puzzle piece that will add these virtues to my empathy to allow me to holistically tend to the people around me. 	
			
I am further motivated in my pursuit of medicine through my clinical experience at St. Mary & St. Mina nonprofit clinic. The main demographic of this clinic included patients from marginalized and underserved communities, which revealed the outcome of disparities in healthcare diversity. Maggie came into the clinic post-op. While waiting for the physician to come in, Maggie spoke with me about her experiences visiting the local hospital. She expressed that her concerns were being disregarded and categorized as simple everyday complaints, and how intimidatingly uncomfortable the hospital was for her. With the disparities of healthcare, a topic dear to my heart, I made sure to sit with Maggie and hear her story. I collected the information and handed it to the medical team. I empathized with Maggie and realized that as a physician, my commitment and empathy will transmit to patients yielding multifaceted healing in the physical, emotional, and spiritual domains. I realized that as a physician, it is important to learn the nuances of each patient to provide for their individual needs.

Medicine encompasses more than the tangible. I believe that going to medical school will allow me to use my knowledge, time, and gifts to lend a helping hand to those in need. Although several career fields are centered towards this common goal, medicine is not simply the best career path out of many. Medicine is the only career path that appeals to, both, my desire to manifest my empathy in actions while also incorporating my infatuation and passion for biomedical science. Medicine has always been my plan A as well as my plan B and C, and so on. I believe that with the superfluous amount of people in the world in need of medical assistance, my experiences have solidified my passion to bring marginalized communities compassionate and representative care. My obsession has framed my life experiences, putting pieces of a puzzle together where the only missing piece is medical school.","I started a tutoring program inspired by children in my community who struggled academically. A lot of them faced language barriers and the new online learning exacerbated their struggles. As the service grew, it rapidly developed to include racial, ethnic, and gender diversity. This is very dear to my heart as an African American female of Arab descent. Growing up, I rarely saw people who ‚Äúlooked like me‚Äù doing things I wanted to do. As a child, if you do not see something represented in society, you assume it is not possible. As I incorporated volunteers from various backgrounds, the service provided hope and inspiration for kids. They saw someone like them excel through middle school geometry for instance. This experience for me highlighted the power of embracing culture as a means of uplifting others and bringing people together. I witnessed the value in immersing myself in a learning environment filled with diverse people, inspired to apply this in my personal endeavors.","At Pinellas Professional Home Care Inc. I am a living coach for persons with disability. What this entails is focusing on helping clients who wish to improve their health and well-being and work towards their personal goals and enjoying each day to the fullest. Whether its helping my clients buy groceries to make dinner for their family or prepare for their first job interview, the act of helping another person reach their goals was worthwhile. Moreover, I believe my service went beyond checking accomplishments off a list. I have had the amazing opportunity to help people gain confidence and a sense of self-efficacy by supporting and encouraging them. Along with guiding clients to maximize their full potential, I am also a friend. Simply developing strong relationships built on love and trust has been the most influential. I believe this aspect of my work, building long lasting relationships, allowed me to impact another person.",,,1,"The pandemic limited my opportunity to embark on mission trips and local medical and non-medical service opportunities.

I accepted, and a few minutes after I arrived the resident assistants appeared and we were written up.

Before joining the room, I was unaware the card games included alcohol. Still, I made the illogical decision to stay in that environment. This was a short-sighted act and I take full responsibility for my actions. It was the last of any type of misconduct. I met with the conduct board and explained that I was only in the presence of alcohol. Afterward, I wrote a letter detailing the harms of drinking alcohol. The situation was resolved and I am currently in good standing with the university. I deeply regret this incident as it is detrimental to my reputation as a good student. 

This incident taught me that it is important which type of people I associate with. I needed to find a group of people that shared my interests in science and medicine. This incident has allowed me to mature and find a network of other students, such as Biology Club and Black Student Union, who share the same academic goals as me.",0,,,,0,0,,0,,0,0,,8347,384.0,27.0,594.0,324.0,16.0,1,621,1,367,04/30/2022,Butler University,Health Science,0,,No,No,No,"$100,000 - 124,999",5,0,1,0,,,,,,,,9,Adequate,2,2023,2,6.0,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,"The blinds were closed shut. The illumination from her bathroom with the door slightly ajar dimly lit her room. This was her preference. Her daily options were between staring into space while her immune system worsened or going to sleep to ignore her growing staph infection. She rarely spoke to me when I bathed her or dropped off a food tray. When she did speak, it was a whisper. Those whispers left me sitting in the chair next to her bed- fully dressed in patient protective equipment- listening to her talk about the loneliness, pain, and regrets she felt at the end of life. I too had a compromised immune system due to my premature birth, so I have experienced my share of hospital melancholy. It took everything in me not to cry in front of this woman who I saw grow devoid of light. This woman never touched her food, never pressed her call light, and never complained about the nursing assistant service. What stuck with me most is when she said I reminded her of her son, who she described as the most caring soul. Her son sadly never visited the nursing home. Each consecutive day her health deteriorated, leaving her dejected. Before the woman moved to quarantined hospice care, she helped me understand that my love for acts of service and medicine are intertwined because both require problem-solving and are rewarded by gratification. Everything I did for her was in hope that her spirits would rise. Her occasional smile when I told her a joke was enough to break the gloom in the air for a few moments, but her demeanor quickly became woeful again. These breaks of gloom gave me a chance to see who she was without the grief of disease. This poignant example of my patient made me realize why I wanted to be a doctor: to rekindle the sense of life stolen from those with illnesses. 

   Working in a nursing home left me with more questions pertaining to the MRSA bacterium. My curiosity led me to conduct my senior thesis on its pathogenicity and what it means from a public health standpoint. My rising interests in infectious diseases and public health drove me toward researching vaccine-derived poliovirus at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I scoured many articles on the efficacy of different polio vaccines for those most at risk. This research resonated with me because it was focused on helping disadvantaged communities. 

   My father, a physician from Nigeria, showed me the nature of the medical field when I was growing up. As an immigrant with an accent, he encountered significant challenges to becoming a successful clinician, but he still persevered. He planted the seeds of altruism and self-worth into me at a young age. He also taught me that a person’s background is a major contributor to ones health status. As a child, my father took me to his practice after school each day. During his office phone calls he approached each patient case like an organic chemistry reaction: examining each possible route to get to the product with different reactions. He showed me the meticulous manner in which physicians performed acts of service. This is when I knew I wanted to be a physician.

   Marginalized communities like ours do not get many chances at a wholesome life, but I take pride in my heritage. When I was informed that I was going to be the first black male to graduate from my Health Science program at my school, I realized that I needed to lead by example and show others who are like me that excelling in the medical field is possible. This spurred me during undergrad to volunteer at the Indiana Math and Science Academy, a school for marginalized students with learning disabilities. 

   I have seen first-hand the relevance of socioeconomic determinants of health among minorities during my time volunteering at Nashville General Hospital. Those with low literacy living in low-income areas with food deserts are disproportionately affected by chronic conditions. On the individual level, I love to volunteer in any area where my help is needed. Hence while I was interning at the CDC, I spent time helping set up and run an HIV testing clinic. I was able to talk with many people while surveying their health choices and direct them to testing booths. Being able to positively affect an individual’s health and see the change firsthand is truly a feeling second to none. Where I heavily felt this same pull was at the CDC. I talked to many Epidemic Intelligence Service officers about their experiences. A few were doctors who described how they responded to infectious disease outbreaks and how they collected data all while treating individuals in the area. With the exposure to the nursing home, my past science classes, and my CDC experience, I want to be an infectious disease physician. This profession would fulfill all three of my passions: infectious disease, individual patient treatment, and serving as a public health advocate for underserved communities. But to get this part of my career, I need a deep and formal understanding of the human mind and body along with the clinical experience. This is why I want to go to medical school.","I was the first black male to graduate from my Health Science program. At first, I was intimidated and afraid of the possibility that my teachers and peers might profile me. It took me a few semesters to understand that, although my race can be a social barrier, the main obstacle in my path to academic success was myself. I learned to be proactive in my education and social life. I learned not to be afraid to ask for help and to be an advocate for myself and those in marginalized positions like mine. This experience in undergraduate gave me a different outlook on my journey to success. It taught me to value those who came before me and paved the path that I am on. This is where my value of community stemmed from. I was initially guarded in my interactions with my peers because they were all from different backgrounds than me, but many of them became good friends. I had to cast away the thought of superficiality- that is, embrace others with open arms regardless of their background. ","I spent the summer months in rural Tennessee helping the locals with any issues they were concerned with, including house repairs, yard work, building sheds or wheelchair ramps, and even running a day camp for their children. The city was Altamont, an area where literacy was low and chronic diseases ran rampant. Many did not have healthcare coverage, and many of the homes were single income with multiple children. I was able to speak with many of them. They detailed their violent and sorrowful upbringing and how there are not many options for them regarding lifestyle because of the environment they were born in. This experience gave me the opportunity to witness the effect of poor health literacy with poor public health and its consequences. I learned to listen and empathize with their concerns. They needed resources from external organizations that also aligned with their values as well. This experience afforded me the opportunity to understand intersectionality when helping others. _x000D_
",,,1,"The beginning of the pandemic proved to be burdensome academically. Many of my classes moved online and most of the social events were canceled. The pandemic consequently put a strain on my plans to take a Certified Nursing Assistant course during that summer. They postponed it for a few months, and I was able to take it during the winter. My original plan was to take the CNA course during the 2020 summer, get my certification, and then study the MCAT material during the late fall and winter so I can take the test early the following 2021 year. Due to COVID-19, I had to now take the CNA course in the 2020 winter, which allowed me to start working at the nursing home the following 2021 summer. That summer I realized I needed more time to study for the MCAT because the long CNA shifts were strenuous on my schedule, so I had to postpone my test until April 2022. With the results from the April MCAT, I plan to retake the test in January 2023.",1,0,1
